Defamatory Statement should be specific and not vague or general.
The essential ingredient of [[IPC - Section 499]] is that the imputation made by the accused should have the potential to harm the reputation of the person against whom the imputation is made.

When the statements are not by themselves defamatory, the summoning order is liable to be set aside.
