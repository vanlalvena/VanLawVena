# About
This is my repository of precedents. I hope this is as helpful to you, as it is to me.

# Restrictions
**I don't intend to ever make this pay-walled, have advertisements or require any form of login, etc.** My intention is to have the information in this repository available at no-cost, for free and to be open-source and open-access.

> [!info]+ Copyright
> The copyright license for the website and its contents (other than quartz and the reported version of the judgments) are at the footer of this page; basically (==***[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)***==) 

# Status
This is (***and will always be***) a work in progress; but as may be evident, it is presently very raw, I'll keep trying to add / improve as and when I have the time or interest, since this is a personal decades long project.


# Uploading of judgments
I have SCC/SCR and other official/private reporters (E.g. Indian Law Reports, Delhi Law Times, etc.) copies in my offline repository; but those have not been uploaded online, since it would probably violate their copyright. 
Hence I am only attaching copies of judgments and orders from the website of the concerned courts, which are in the public domain.

> [!imp]- Reference to Reporters in notes
> Any reference to official / private reported copies are only because I have "synced" my offline/personal copy with the online version, and it is for my personal consumption, and ***those copies of the judgments reported by official / private reporters are only accessible by me*** and have been made **not accessible** on the online version of this repository .
> Doing this allows me to be more efficient and have require to work on only one vault / repository.

# Index
[[Index of all Cases]] ; [[Index of all Cases by Courts]] ; [[Index of all Laws]]  (***perpetually in draft, but even more so now***)
