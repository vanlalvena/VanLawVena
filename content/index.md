This is my repository of precedents. I hope this is as helpful to you, as it is to me.

This is still a work in progress; having to copy from my old repository into this website and format those files takes time.

I also had SCC copies in my "old" repository; but since I am uploading this online, I don't think I can share those copies without violating their copyright. Hence I am only attaching copies of judgments and orders from the website of the concerned courts, or of official reporters (Supreme Court Reports, Indian Law Reports, etc.).

[[Index of all Cases]] ; [[Index of all Cases by Courts]] ; [[Index of all Laws]]  (***still in draft***)

For any issues with this Website or to give any feedback or suggestions or requests, please refer to the README and License pages on my [GitHub Page of VanLawVena](https://github.com/vanlalvena/VanLawVena) which has instructions on how to "raise an issue".
