In case of an appeal, death of the *plaintiff-appellant* during proceedings will abate the appeal if there is only one appellant, and the right to sue does not survive. (**Page 809, C-D**)
	The legal representatives will not have any right to continue the appeal
	If the appellantâ€™s right to sue survives on his death, the right to prosecute the appeal by the legal representatives also survives (**Page 809, E**)

Cause of action for defamation does not survive death of appellant (**Page 810, C**)
	This is only when the suit is dismissed, and the appellant-plaintiff is seeking to enforce the right to sue for damages. (**Page 810, E**)
	If there is a decree in favour of the plaintiff, since the cause of action merges into the decree,  the legal representatives are entitle to defend and be substituted as *respondent-plaintiff* (**Page 810, F**)

Section 306 applies to executors, administrators and legal representatives (**Page 810, G-H**)
