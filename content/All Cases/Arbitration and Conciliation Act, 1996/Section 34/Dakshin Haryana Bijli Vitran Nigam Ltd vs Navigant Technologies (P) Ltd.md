Case Reference: (2021) 7 SCC 657 : (2021) 1 SCR 1135
Case Number: CA No 791/2021
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 02
Coram: Indu Malhotra (Author), Ajay Rastogi
Date: 02.03.2021

There is only one *arbitral award*. A dissenting opinion or minority opinion does not determine rights and liabilities of parties. Only majority award can be enforced. (**Para 4(i)**)
Minority opinion is ***not*** the arbitral award, but only an opinion (**Para 4(i)**). However, the dissenting opinion can be relied upon by the party seeking to set aside the award (**Para 4(xx)(a)**); and the court is not precluded from considering the findings and conclusions of the dissenting opinion of the minority member (**Para 4(xx)(b)**)

Making and delivery of an Award are different stages of arbitral proceedings (**Para 4(viii)**)

Signing of award is mandatory. The award is final only when it is signed. Each of the members must sign the award to make it a valid award. Signing of the award gives legal effect and finality to the award  (**Para 4(vii, viii, xvi)**)

Delivery must be of a *signed* copy of award by members of Arbitral Tribunal or Arbitrator and not any copy of award. (**Para 4(ix, xi)**)

For limitation, period of limitation starts only on date on which signed copy of final award is received by *parties*. It is from this date that an application under [[A&C Act, 1996 - Section 33]] may be filed and the proceedings would terminate under [[A&C Act, 1996 - Section 32]](1) (**Para 4(ix, x, xi, xvii)**)

When delivery is on a holiday, or non-working day, it cannot be considered to be *receipt of the award* for the purposes of [[A&C Act, 1996 - Section 31]](5) (**Para 4(xii)**)

The tribunal becomes *functus officio* on termination of proceedings, that is when the final award is passed, as proscribed in [[A&C Act, 1996 - Section 32]] (**Para 4(xiii, xvii)**)

The dissenting opinion must be delivered contemporaneously as the final award and not on a subsequent date. The period for rendering the award as also the dissenting opinion must be within the period prescribed in  (**Para 4(xiv)**)

Section 5 of Limitation Act does not apply to applications filed under Section 34 A&C Act.  No further time can be given beyond the time specified in [[A&C Act, 1996 - Section 34#Section 34(3)]]; and the thirty days beyond the three months can be granted only if sufficient case is made out. (**Para 4(xviii)**)

Section 17 of Limitation Act cannot be extended to section 34 of A&C Act. Time limit under section 34(3) specifies that no further time can be granted beyond the time period mentioned. (**Para 4(xix)**)

If objections are not filed within the period prescribed, holder would be entitled to move for enforcement of the arbitral award as a deemed decree of the court (**Para 4(xix)**)

Notes that dissenting view upheld in [[Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co Ltd vs National Highways Authority of India]], (2019) 15 SCC 131 :: permissible only by invoking powers of SC under Article 142

The court has no powers to modify an arbitral award (**Para 4(xx)(f)**). The court can only dismiss the objections filed and uphold the award *OR* set aside the award if the grounds contained in [[A&C Act, 1996 - Section 34#Section 34(2)]] and [[A&C Act, 1996 - Section 34#Section 34(2A)]] are made out.
