## Necessity of Reasoned Award

Arbitration proceedings are not per se comparable to judicial proceedings. Parties may opt for arbitration before any person, even those who do not have prior legal experience. (**Para 30**)
	Requirement for reasoning should be given a rational meaning in light of commercial wisdom inherent in choice of arbitration.
Held: [[Raipur Development Authority vs Chokhamal Contractors]] and [[S Harharan Singh vs Union of India]] both *legislatively overruled* (**Para 33**)

Section 31(3) expressly requires reasoned award as a default.
Passing of reasoned award *is not an empty formulation* under [[A&C Act, 1996]] (**Para 33**)

However, section 31(3) *does not require an elaborate judgment*; the reasoning can be implied by the court from a fair reading of the award and documents referred to (**Para 35**)

### Explanation of a Reasoned Order

It must be proper, intelligible and adequate (**Para 36**)
	If the challenge is based on impropriety or perversity, it must strictly be challenged on those grounds
	If the challenge is that the award is unintelligible, it would amount to no reasons
	Adequacy: *degree of particularity* cannot be stated in a precise manner as that *depends* on the *complexity of the issue*
		Even if court concludes that there is a gap in the reasoning, court needs to have regard to the documents submitted and the contentions raised
		Awards with inadequate reasons *must not be set aside in casual and cavalier manner*

### Purpose of section 34(4) - Remand for reasoning

The purpose of section 34(4) is to give an opportunity to the Tribunal to undo curable defects. (**Para 37**)

The award can be set aside, *only when there is complete perversity in the reasoning* (**Para 38**)

## Alternative View not ground to set aside arbitral award

Courts should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal *even if the reasoning provided in the award is implied* (**Para 27**) :: unless the award portrays perversity unpardonable under [[A&C Act, 1996 - Section 34]]
