Case Name : ***I-Pay Clearing Services Pvt Ltd vs ICICI Bank Ltd***
Case Reference: (2022) 3 SCC 121
Case Number: CA No. 7 of 2022
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 02 
Coram: R Subhash Reddy (Author); 
Date: 03.01.2022

There is a difference between *finding* and *reasons*. (**Para 20**)
	While the former is a *decision on an issue*, the latter is the *link between materials on which certain conclusions are based and the actual conclusions*.
Merely because an application under section 34(4) is filed, the Court is not bound to remit the matter to the Arbitral Tribunal; and the *court has to exercise discretion* (**Para 21**)

The discretionary power under [[A&C Act, 1996 - Section 34#Section 34(4)]] is to be exercised *when there is inadequate reasoning* OR *to fill up gaps in the reasoning* ***in support of the findings which are already recorded in the award***. (**Para 21**)
	Under the guise of additional reasons and filling up gaps in the reasoning, no award can be remitted to the Arbitrator where there are no findings on the contentious issues in the award.

*If there are **no findings** on the contentious issues in the award*, or if any *findings are recorded **ignoring the material evidence on record***, the same are acceptable grounds for setting aside the award itself. (**Para 21**)
When it ***prima facie appears*** that *patent illegality* in the award by not recording reasons, the court *may not accede to the request for giving an opportunity to the Arbitral Tribunal to resume arbitral proceedings* (**Para 21**)
