All awards are decisions of the arbitral tribunal, but all decisions are not awards: (**Para 9**)
	A decision is generic, but *an award is a specific decision that affects the rights of the parties, has important consequences and can be enforced*
	Relying on Article 31(1) UNCITRAL:
		An award must conclude the dispute as to the specific issue determined in the award so that it is res judicata effect between the parties.
			If it a final award, it terminates the tribunal’s jurisdiction.
		An award disposes of parties’ respective claims
		An award may be confirmed by recognition and enforcement
		An award may be challenged in the courts of the place of arbitration

There’s a distinction between an award and decisions such as procedural orders and directions: (**Para 10**)
	An award has finality attached to a decision on a substantive issue.
	The term award is generally reserved for decisions that finally determine the substantive issues; as opposed to procedural orders and directions, which are concerned with the conduct of the arbitration.
		Procedural orders and directions *help move arbitration forward; deal with matters such as exchange of written evidence, production of documents and arrangements for conduct of hearing*
		They do not have the status of awards.
		They can be called into question only *after* the final award has been made (as evidence of ‘bias’ or ‘lack of due process’)
An arbitral award is defined as a final decision on all or part of the dispute submitted, whether it concerns the merits of the dispute, jurisdiction or a procedural issue leading them to end the proceedings (**Para 11**)
		There are four aspects of an awards:
			Made by arbitrators
			Resolves a dispute 
			Is a binding decision 
			It may be partial

Recourse to a court being available to a party does not prohibit the parties from mutually agreeing to a second look at an award, and an appeal from decision rendered at the first instance (**Para 28**)
