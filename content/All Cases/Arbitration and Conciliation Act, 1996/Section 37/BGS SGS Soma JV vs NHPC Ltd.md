## When does appeal under 37 lie against order in section 34 
An order refusing to entertain a section 34 application for want of territorial jurisdiction cannot be challenged under section 37 (**Para 14, 22**)
	There is a distinction between judgments which set aside or refuse to set aside an arbitral award *after* the court applies its mind to the section 34 application and *preliminary orders of condonation of delay* ***which do not in any way impact the arbitral award that has been assailed***  (**Para 19**)
