Neutral Citation:
Case Number: Civil Appeals 5573-74/2004
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 02
Coram: HK Sema, Dr AR Lakshmanan (*Author*)
Date: 22.03.2006

A restraint beyond the term of a contract is void and not enforceable (**Page 170, A-B**)
	*However*, ==doctrine of restraint of trade== ***does not apply during continuance of contract for employment***; it only applies *when the contract has ended*
	This doctrine is applicable to all contracts, not only contracts of employment

Specific performance of *contracts for personal service* are impermissible (**Page 170 D**)

### Consideration for interim injunction

Party being forced to enter into a contract with a party they do not wish to deal with, is not something that can be compensated (**Page 170, F-H**)
	*Establishing prima facie case of breach of contract* ***does not by itself entitle said party to injunction sought*** (**Page 171, A-C**)
