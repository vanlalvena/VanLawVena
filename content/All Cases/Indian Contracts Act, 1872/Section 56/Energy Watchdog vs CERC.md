[[Edwinton Commercial Corp vs Tsavliris Russ]], (2007) 2 Lloydâ€™s Rep 517 (CA): **Doctrine of furstration of contract *is not to be lightly invoked***. *Mere incidence of expense or delay or onerousness is not sufficient*. There has to be **a break in identity between the contract and in its performance in the new circumstances**. 

[[Taylor vs Caldwell]], (1861-73) All ER Rep 24: If unforeseen events occur during the performance of the contract making it impossible of performance, in the sense that **the fundamental basis of the contract goes**, *then such contract need not be performed since in such circumstances,* ***insisting upon performance would be unjust***.
