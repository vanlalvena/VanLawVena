Case Name : ***Smt Dilboo (Dead) by Lrs & Ors vs Smt Dhanraji (Dead) & Ors***

Case Reference: (2000) Supp 3 SCR 214

Case Number CA 3673/1982

Neutral Citation: 2000 INSC 440

Court: Supreme Court

Bench: 02

Coram: VN Khare, SN Variava (*Author*)

Date: 12.09.2000

When the suit is filed beyond time, the plaintiff has to aver and prove that the suit is within the permissible time *of their knowledge*. In the absence of any averment or proof to show that the suit is within time, the suit fails. (**Page 227 at A-B**)

The date of registration of a document, is the date of deemed knowledge. (**Page 227 at B-C**)

Where a fact could be discovered by due diligence, then deemed knowledge would be attributed to the plaintiff because *a p arty cannot be allowed to extend the period of limitation by merely claiming that he had no knowledge* (**Page 227 at B-C**)
