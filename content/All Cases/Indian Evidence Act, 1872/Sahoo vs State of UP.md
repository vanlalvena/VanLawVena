In the case of circumstantial evidence, all the facts so established should be consistent *only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused*. The circumstance should be of a conclusive nature and the tendency must be that it excludes other hypotheses other than the one proposed to be proved. (**Page 88, B**)

Soliloquy of an accused admitting his guilt is not an extra judicial confession (**Page 89, C-G**)
	A statement, whether communicated or not, admitting guilt, is a confession of guilt (**Page 90, A**)
	A confessional soliloquy is a direct piece of evidence (**Page 90, B**)
		This evidence *must be established by cogent evidence*


A statement under 157 Evidence Act means “something that is stated”; and element of communication is not necessary (**Page 89, E**)
