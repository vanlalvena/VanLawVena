### Related witness
Witness is relative of victim of crime, cannot be characterised as *interested witness* just for that reason (**Para 7**)
	Interest witness is one who has *direct or indirect interest* in someone convicted
	However, creditworthiness and evidence of relatives of victim must be scrutinised with greater care and caution (**Paras 7, 12**)

Accused must lay foundation, if plea of false implication is made. (**Para 10**)

### Delay in FIR
Mere delay in lodging in FIR is not fatal to the case (**Paras 14, 16**)
