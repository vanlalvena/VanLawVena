##### Conspiracy
Stages of conspiracy (**Para 402**)
	1. Two or more persons share information about doing an illegal act or a legal act by illegal means
	2. Some or all sharing that information may form an intention to do the above.
	3. *Only those who form requisite intention* would be parties to the agreement and would be conspirators.
		1. ***Those who drop out cannot be roped in as collaborators on the basis  of mere knowledge*** *unless they commit acts or omissions from which guilty common intention can be inferred*.
	4. It is *not necessary* that all *conspirators should participate from inception to end* of conspiracy; some may join *after the time when such intention was first entertained* by one of them.
	5. When, in pursuance of the agreement, the conspirators commit offences *individually*, or adopt means to do legal act illegally which was nexus to object of conspiracy, **all of them will be liable for such offences *even if some of them have not participated in the commission of these offences***
	6. The agreement is a sine qua non of conspiracy.
