Test Identification Parade is admissible under section 9. - [[Evidence - Section 9]]

Test Identification Parade is not a substantive piece of evidence (**Para 32, Page 296, C-D**)

TIP is part of the investigation and applies *where the accused is not known before-hand*. It is only used to **corroborate** the evidence; and is not substantive evidence (**Para 36, Page 297-298, H;A-C**)

Only that part of confession is admissible which leads to the recovery (**Para 67, Para 310, C-D**) - [[Evidence - Section 27]]

Evidence of prosecution witness cannot be rejected in toto merely because prosecution treated him as hostile and cross examined him.(**Para 69, Page 310, F-H**)
	Relevant parts of evidence of hostile witness that are admissible in law can be relied upon by the prosecution or the defence (**Para 69, Page 311, D**)

Entire evidence cannot be disregarded only because there are omissions, contradictions and discrepancies *which do not go into the heart of the matter* and shake the *basic version of the prosecutionâ€™s witness* (**Para 71, Page 311, F-H**)
	Minor discrepancies are bound to occur

Death penalty upheld; case where during demonstration, appellants burnt a bus of girl students by using petrol; 03 died, others received burn injuries
	Unprovoked act; emotional depravity; no mitigating circumstance
