Case Name : ***Palvinder Kaur vs State of Punjab***
Case Reference: (1953) SCR 94 : AIR 1952 SC 354
Neutral Citation:
Case Number: Crl A 41/1952 
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 03
Coram: Mehr Chand Mahajan, Chandrasekhara Aiyar, Bhagwati
Date: 22.10.1953

To establish the charge under 201 IPC, it must be proved that: (**Page 102**)
1. the accused knew or had reason to believe that such offence had been committed; and
2. With requisite knowledge and with intent to screen the offender from legal punishment;
3. Causes evidence to disappear OR
	1. Gives false information, knowing or having reason to believe that the same is false

A statement that, when read as a whole, is exculpatory, and does not suggest or prove commission of any offence, does not amount to a confession and is inadmissible. (**Page 104**)

A confession must admit the offence or substantially the facts which constitute the offence.  (**Page 104**)

An admission of a gravely incriminating fact is not in itself a confession.  (**Page 104**)

A statement that contains self-exculpatory matter cannot amount to a confession; *if that exculpatory statement is of some fact*, if true, would negative the offence alleged to have been confessed.  (**Page 104**)

When there is no evidence that affirmatively shows that the portion of the exculpatory element of the confession is false, *the course must accept or reject the confession* ***as a whole*** (**Page 153**)
	The court cannot accept only the inculpatory element while rejecting the exculpatory element.
