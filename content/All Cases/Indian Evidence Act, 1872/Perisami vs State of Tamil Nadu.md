Case Reference: (1996) Supp 6 SCR 757 :  (1996) 6 SCC 457
Neutral Citation: 
Case Number: Crl A 346/1993
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 02
Coram: AS Anand, KT Thomas (*Author*)
Date: 25.09.1996

Section 105 does not water down the burden of proof as laid down in section 101 (**Paras 17-19**)
	It is for the prosecution to prove that the accused has committed the offence
	The legal presumption in section 105 *does not displace the traditional burden on the prosecution*
		Only when the prosecution has proved its case with reasonable certainty can the court rest on the presumption sections

Even if the evidence placed or relied upon by the accused does not discharge the burden under section 105, ***it can still raise a reasonable doubt as regards the necessary ingredients of the offence itself*** (**Paras 18, 19**)
