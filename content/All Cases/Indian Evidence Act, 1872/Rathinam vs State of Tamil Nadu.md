When the allegation is grave and serious, the evidence must be examined with greater care.
The court should resist the tendency to look beyond the file and assess the evidence dispassionately. The court should not be swayed either by the horror of the crime or the character of the accused.

Mere suspicion, however strong, is not a substitute for the legal proof required to substantiate the charge. The graver the charge, the greater is the standard of proof.
