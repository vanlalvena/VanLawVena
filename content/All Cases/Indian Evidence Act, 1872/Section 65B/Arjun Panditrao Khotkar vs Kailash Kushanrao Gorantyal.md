Case Name : ***Arjun Panditrao Khotkar vs Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal***

Case Reference: (2020) 7 SCR 180

Neutral Citation: 2020 INSC 453

Case Number: CA Nos 20825-20826/2017

Court: Supreme Court

Bench: 03

Coram:  RF Nariman (Author), S Ravindra Bhat, V Ramasubramanian (Concurring)

[[Evidence - Section 65]] differentiates between *existence*, *condition*, and *contents*  of a document. (**Para 19**)
	1. *Existence* goes into the *admissibility* of a document.
	2. *Contents* are to be proved *after* a document becomes admissible.
	3. [[Evidence - Section 65A]] speaks of *contents* of electronic records being *proved* in accordance with [[Evidence - Section 65B]]
	4. [[Evidence - Section 65B]] speaks of *admissibility* of electronic records which deals with *existence* ***and*** *contents* of electronic records being *proved* once *admissible* into evidence.

The deeming fiction in [[Evidence - Section 65B]] is there since *document* as defined by [[Evidence - Section 3]] ***does not include electronic records***.  (**Para 21**)

The conditions in [[Evidence - Section 65B]] are cumulative and the word *any* must be read as *all* (**Para 23**)

The deeming fiction in [[Evidence - Section 65B]] which makes the information in the electronic record a document admissible *only if the further conditions are satisfied as to both the information and the computer in question* (**Para 30**)
	[[Evidence - Section 65B]] differentiates between  (**Para 31**)
		*original document*, which would be the original electronic record in the computer in which the original information is first stored, and 
		the *computer output* containing such information which may be ***treated as evidence*** of the contents of the original document.

The requisite certificate under [[Evidence - Section 65B]](4) is unnecessary if the original document itself is proved (**Para 32**).
	This can be done by the owner of a laptop computer, computer tablet, mobile phone *stepping into the witness box* and proving that the connected device on which the original information is first stored

(**Para 59**)
