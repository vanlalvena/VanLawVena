### Declaration as hostile does not ipso facto efface evidence of witness

*Evidence of a prosecution witness cannot be rejected in toto merely because the prosecution chose to treat him as hostile and cross examine him*. The evidence of such witness cannot be treated as effaced or washed off the record; but *can be accepted to the extent their version is found to be dependable on a careful scrutiny thereof* (**Page 13, B-D**)

### Not necessary to call different persons for recoveries at different places
Relying on [[Himachal Pradesh Administration vs Om Prakash]] to say that there is no requirement of different witnesses when recoveries are effected from different places on information furnished by the acused. *There is no injunction in law against the same set of witnesses being present at hthe successive enquiries if nothing could be urged against them* (**Page 17**)

### Appellate court can review entire evidence, not bound by appreciation of evidence by Trial Court

Appellate court can even recorded a conviction in view of [[IPC - Section 34]] despite the acquittal of a co-accused. (**Page 21**)
	However, it may not reverse the order of acquittal in the absence of a State appeal
