Neutral Citation:
Case Number: Crl A Nos 62-63/2014
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 03
Coram: Uday Umesh Lalit, Indu Malhotra, Krishna Murari
Date: 18.12.2019

Magistrate must provide legal representation even if the accused person do not ask for it; they must be informed of their entitlement to legal representation at State cost  - Section 303 CrPC
	Absence of legal representation is a violation of the accused’s fundamental right and trial can be vitiated and the conviction and sentence set aside

Trial under wrong procedure (as summons case instead of warrants case) is bad in law, and an accused being prejudiced, the conviction and sentence can be set aside. However, trial would be held de novo

Principles of legal aid (**Para 13** - *Page 1231*)

Norms for amicus curiae for accused in criminal cases (**Para 22** - *Page 1234*)
