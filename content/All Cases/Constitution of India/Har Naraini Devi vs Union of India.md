The question of repugnancy arises only if both the Parliament and the State legislature have made law with respect to any one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent list (**Para 18**)

Any State enactment relating to Agricultural land tenures is a special law. (**Para 20**)

Amendments are deemed to apply prospectively unless expressly specified to apply retrospectively or intended to have been done so (**Para 23**)

Repeal of an enactment *does not effect previous operation of such enactment* (**Para 24**)

[[Delhi Land Reforms]] is a special law, and [[Hindu Succession Act]] is a general law; existence or absence of 4(2) of the [[Hindu Succession Act]] is immaterial (**Para 26**)
