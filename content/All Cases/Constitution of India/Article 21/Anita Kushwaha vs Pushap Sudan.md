Access to justice is an invaluable human right.
Every citizen has a right of ***unimpeded access to a court***
Access to justice is and has been recognised as a part and parcel of right to life in India and in all civilised societies around the globe.
The right is so basic and unalienable that *no system of governance can possibly ignore its significance, **leave alone afford to deny the same to its citizens***.

Court has given an expansive meaning and interpretation to the word ‘life’ appearing in [[Constitution - Article 21]].

Access to justice should be considered as falling inside the class and category of the rights as part and parcel of Article 21.

Life implies not only life in the physical sense but **a bundle of rights that *makes life worth living***.

Equality before law and equal protection of laws is not limited in its application to the realm of executive action that enforces the law and is also available in relation to proceedings before courts and tribunal and adjudicatory fora where law is applied and justice administered.

Citizen’s inability to access courts or any other adjudicatory mechanism provided for determination of rights and obligations is bound to result in denial of guarantee contained in Article 14both in relation to equality before law as well as equal protection of laws.

Absence of any adjudicatory mechanism or the inadequacy of such mechanism, is bound to prevent those looking for enforcement of their right to equality before laws and equal protection of the laws from seeking redress and thereby negate the guarantee of equality and reducing it to a mere teasing illusion.

Access to justice is part of both Article 21 and Article 14.

{*Four main facets*} The essence of access to justice are:
1. State must provide effective adjudicatory mechanism;
2. Mechanism must be reasonably accessible in terms of distance
3. Process of adjudication must be speedy
4. Litigant’s access to adjudicatory process must be affordable

[[In re LLewelyn Evans]], AIR 1926 Bom 551: If the end of justice is justice and the spirit of justice is fairness, then each side should have equal opportunity to prepare its own case and to law its evidence fully, freely and fairly before the court; which necessarily involves preparation. This preparation is far more effective from the point of view of justice, if made with the aid of skilled legal advice.

This weakens the justice delivery system in the long run and poses a threat to the rule of law. **Access to justice is not to be understood in a** *purely quantitative dimension* **but must be understood to mean *qualitative access to justice***.
