### When is interference in election process permissible

When there are issues which indicate *unjust executive action* or an *attempt to disturb a level playing field* between candidates or parties, *with no justifiable or intelligible basis*, Constitutional Courts are ***duty-bound*** to step in (**Para 37**)

### Pendency of Supreme Courtâ€™s reference to larger bench or review 

High Courts should not await decision, but decide the case on the basis of *law as it stands* (**Para 35**)
	High Court *cannot refuse* to follow a judgment simply because it is doubted by a later co-ordinate Bench; ***it must follow the earlier judgment***
