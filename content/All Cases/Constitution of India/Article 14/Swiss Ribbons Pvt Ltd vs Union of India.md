Legislation can be struck down as being manifestly arbitrary and violative of Article 14.
Manifestly arbitrary or manifest arbitrariness means when it is not fair, not reasonable, discriminatory not transparent, capricious, biased, with favouritism or nepotism and not in pursuit of promotion of healthy competition and equitable treatment. It should conform to norms which are rational, informed with reason and guided by public interest.

A statute is not retrospective merely because it affects existing rights; nor is it retrospective merely because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing
