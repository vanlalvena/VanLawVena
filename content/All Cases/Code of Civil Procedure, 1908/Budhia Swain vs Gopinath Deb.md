Explaining power to recall; (**Page 1194-B**)
	Vested in all courts/tribunals
Power to recall (**Page 1194-H**)
	(1) Proceedings culminating in order suffering from inherent lack of jurisdiction; *and such lack of jurisdiction is patent*
	(2) Fraud or collusion in obtaining judgment
	(3) Mistake of court prejudicing party
	(4) Judgment rendered in ignorance of non-service of necessary party, or non representation of estate

Difference in *lack of jurisdiction* and *error in exercise of jurisdiction* (**Page 1195-C**)
	1) Lack of jurisdiction strikes at root of exercise and can vitiate proceedings, rendering orders passed a nullity
	2) Error in exercise of jurisdiction does not vitiate legality and validity of proceedings

[[AR Antulay vs RS Nayak (7JB - 1988)]], AIR (1988) SC 1531
	*Para 130*
		Inherent power to set aside judgments
			1) Where judgment rendered in ignorance of the fact that a necessary party had not been served but was shown as served; 
				or in ignorance of fact that necessary party had died and estate not represented
			2) Judgment obtained by fraud
			3) Party had no notice and decree against him; on proving that there was no service

Suit entertained and decided despite being barred by limitation is an illegality, and not a decree without jurisdiction and has to be set-aside; it would not be a nullity. (**Page 1196-F**)

[[Hira Lal Patni vs Sri Kali Nath]], AIR (1962) SC 199
[[Ittyavira Mathai vs Varkey Varkey]], AIR (1964) 15 SC 907
	Decree passed, though suit is barred by time, would amount to an illegality and aggrieved party can have it set aside
	Court having jurisdiction over subject matter and parties, though deciding wrong, would not be doing something it had no jurisdiction to do; such decrees would not be a nullity.
