Distinction between *good cause* under [[CPC - Order IX rule 3]] and *sufficient cause* under [[CPC - Order IX rule 13]]

Res judicata not limited to [[CPC - Section 11]]. The first court must have had **jurisdiction** and **competency** to ==entertain and decide the issue==.
*Adjournment for pronouncement of judgment is not adjournment for hearing*.

[[CPC - Order IX rule 7]] is an interlocutory proceeding. It does not put an end to litigation. It does not involve determination of issues in controversy.
Order 9 rule 7 is not applicable when court adjourns proceedings for pronouncement. The matter is at the *stage* of [[CPC - Order IX rule 6]], and the remedy is under [[CPC - Order IX rule 13]] for setting aside the ex parte decree.

Inherent power under [[CPC - Section 151]] cannot override express of implied provisions of law.
