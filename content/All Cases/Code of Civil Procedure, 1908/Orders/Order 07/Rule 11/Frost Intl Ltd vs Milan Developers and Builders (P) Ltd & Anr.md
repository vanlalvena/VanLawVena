Case Number: CA 1689/2022
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 02
Coram: MR Shah ; BV Nagarathna (Author)

Reading of the plaint for the purpose of O VII rule 11 must be *meaningful and not format* and such a reading of the plaint must show that it is *manifestly vexatious and meritless* in not disclosing right to sue.
Clever drafting may create illusion of cause of action which should be nipped in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party.
Purpose of conferment of power under O VII rule 11 is that litigation which is meaningless and bound to prove abortive should not be permitted to occupy time of the court and exercise of respondent. Sword of Damocles need not be kept hanging over respondent's head unnecessarily without point or purpose.
O VII rule 11 laws down independent remedy to challenge maintainability of suit irrespective of right to contest the same on merits.
There is a duty case on the Court to perform its obligations in rejecting the plaint when the same is hit by the infirmities in Rule 11, even without intervention of the defendant.
For the purpose of O VII rule 11, the averments in the plaint in their entirety must be held to be correct and to assess if the averments are taken to be correct, would a decree be passed.
The plaint must be construed as it stands without any amendments.
Averments in written statement and contentions of defendant are wholly immaterial while considering prayer for rejection of plaint.
In exercise of power under O VII rule 11, court to determine if assertions made in the plaint are contrary to statutory law or judicial dicta for deciding whether a case for rejecting the plaint at the threshold is made out.
It is not permissible to cull out a sentence or passage and read it in isolation. The substance, and not merely the form has to be looked into. The plaint has to be construed as it stands without addition or subtraction of words.
If allegations in the plaint prima facie show a cause of action, court cannot embark upon an enquiry whether the allegations are true in fact.
The power under O VII rule 11 can be exercised by the Court at any stage in the suit, either before registering the plaint or after issuing summons to the defendant, or before conclusion of the trial.

Omission on part of plaintiff to pray for further consequential relief is relevant only at the time of final adjudication of suit.

No plaintiff can be permitted to seek relief in a suit which would frustrate defendants from initiating prosecution against plaintiff or seeking any other remedy available in law.
The equitable principle underlying Section 41(b) SRA which deals with perpetual conjunction; it has nothing to do with section 37 CPC. A superior court can injunct person by restraining him from instituting or prosecuting proceedings before subordinate court; save for this specific carving out of area where access to justice may be impeded by court injunction; Legislature desired that court ordinarily should not impeded access to justice. Refer also to Section 41(d) SRA.
Suit to restrain criminal proceedings being instituted is not maintainable; principle also applicable to Section 138 NI Act; an order of injunction cannot be granted and hands of criminal court cannot be fettered by the civil court.

There is a rebuttable presumption that in every negotiable instrument including a cheque was made or drawn for consideration and every such instrument when it has been accepted is for a consideration - as seen in Sections 118(a) and Section 138 of NI Act
