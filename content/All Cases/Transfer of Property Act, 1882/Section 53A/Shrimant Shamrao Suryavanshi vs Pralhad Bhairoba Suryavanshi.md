There are **six necessary conditions** for a transferee to defend or protect his possession under [[ToPA - Section 53A]].
1. There must be a contract to transfer for **consideration** of any immovable property;
2. The contract must be in **writing**, signed by the transferor, or by someone on his behalf;
3. The writing must be in such words from which the terms necessary to construe the transfer can be ascertained;
4. Transferee must, in part-performance of the contract, **take possession of the property** *or any part thereof*;
5. Transferee must have **done some act in furtherance** of the contract;
6. Transferee must be **performed or be willing to perform** *his part* of the contract.

Limitation Act does not extinguish a defence **but only *bars* the *remedy***.
	Though the period of limitation may bar a suit for specific performance of contract, it is open to a defendant in a suit for recovery of possession to take a plea in defence of part-performance of the contract to protect his possession. *Though, he may **not be able to enforce that right** through a suit or action*. 

Refer also:
[[MK Venkatachari vs LAR Arunachalam Pilla]], AIR 1967 Mad 410: The defence to limitation is a creature of positive law **and cannot be extended to cases which do not strictly fall within the enactment**. It is an established canon of construction of the law of limitation *not to enlarge the scope of statutory provisions of limitation by analogy or logic.*
