Parole does not amount to suspension of sentence or stay of conviction - [[Rajesh Kumar vs GNCTD]]

A direction to the accused released on anticipatory bail to submit himself to custody and only thereafter apply for regular bail is contrary to Article 21 since it would amount to deprivation of personal liberty.

Interim bail is not defined in the [[CrPC]] (**Para 17**);  it is *temporary liberation for a fixed period of time*. It is **bail on a pro-tem basis**. It is not a substitute or alternative for regular bail.
Interim bail should be granted for the minimal time deservedly necessary (**Para 19, 20(4)**)
[[NDPS - Section 37]] and [[NDPS - Section 32A]] are to be kept in mind when deciding the application for interim bail (**Para 20(2)**)

The court granting interim bail should consider whether sending the accused / convict in police custody would suffice and meet the ends of justice (**Para 20(3)**)
