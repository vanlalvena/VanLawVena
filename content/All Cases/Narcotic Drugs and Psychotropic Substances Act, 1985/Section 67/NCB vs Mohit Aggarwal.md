Reasonable grounds means credible, plausible and grounds grounds for the Court to believe that the accused person is not guilty. To arrive at such conclusion, there must exist circumstances that exist which persuade the court to believe that the accused would not have committed such an offence. (**Para 14**)
	The court must also be satisfied that the accused person is unlikely to commit any offence while on bail.

Court is not required to record a finding that the accused person is not guilty. The court is not expected to weight the evidence for arriving at a finding. (**Para 15**)

Length of period of custody or fact that chargesheet has been filed, and trial commenced are not considerations that can be treated as persuasive grounds. (**Para 18**)
