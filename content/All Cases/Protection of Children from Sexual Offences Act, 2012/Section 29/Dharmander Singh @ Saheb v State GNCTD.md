Presumption of guilt as under section 29 POCSO kicks in only after charge are framed i.e., **once trial begins**; and even then foundational facts must be established.

As per right to fair, an important consideration for grant of bail is to allow an accused the liberty to prepare his defence so that the right under Article 21 is real not merely chimerical

To promote public justice, mechanical detention should be demoted

Prosecution commences when the court starts applying its mind regarding the culpability of the accused

Cognisance is taken of the ‘offence’ and not of the ‘offender’

A penal provision, whether substantive or procedural, is susceptible to two interpretations, it must be construed strictly, narrowly and in a manner that is favourable to the accused
