Even though the arbitration clause does not explicitly state that the award would be *final and binding*, when there is a **clear intention** to refer the dispute to arbitration and abide by the tribunal’s decision, party autonomy has to be protected. (**para 24**)

Deficiency of words in an agreement which otherwise fortifies that party’s intention to arbitrate their disputes cannot legitimise annulment of arbitration clause (**para 25**)

Courts must give greater emphasis to the substance of the clause (**para 28**)
