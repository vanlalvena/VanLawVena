## Analysis

> [!tldr]+ Distinction between Summoning of Witness/Document and Search Warrants
> Summoning / Production is violative of Accused's right against self incrimination. Section 93(1)(a) can ***only be issued in a circumstance where Section 91(1) could have been issued.***
> However, no such restrictions for Search Warrants under Section 93(1)(b) or Section 93(1)(c)

The expression "person" does not include within its ambit a person Accused of an offence. They cannot be made to produce a document or thing. [Page 680, Placitum F - SCR]

> [!warning]- Possible conflict of opinion in precedents
> At Page 680, Placitum E, the Court notes that there *may* be a conflict in the observations in [[State of Bombay vs Kathi Kalu Oghad]]-11J and [[Shyamlal Mohanlal vs State of Gujarat]]-5J
> In the former, it was held that self-incrimination was restricted to information / document that contains statement of accused based on personal knowledge.
> However, in the latter, it was held that "person" does not include an accused.
