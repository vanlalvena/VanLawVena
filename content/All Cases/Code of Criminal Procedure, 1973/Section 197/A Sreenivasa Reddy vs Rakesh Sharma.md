Section 197 CrPC is attracted only where the public servant is not removable from is service without sanction of the Government.

Simply because someone is a public servant under the [[PoC 1988|Prevention of Corruption Act]] does not mean they will be a public servant under the [[IPC|Indian Penal Code]] {Now, [[BNS]]}
>Offences  under the Corruption Act and the IPC/BNS are different and distinct offences.

Discharge from the Corruption Act does not necessarily result in discharge from the IPC/BNS offences.
