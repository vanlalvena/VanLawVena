[[CrPC]] mandates compulsory registration of FIR in case of cognizable offence without conducting preliminary inquiry. (**Para 29**)

The sine qua non for recording an FIR under section 154 is the following: (**Para 39**):
	1. There must be information
	2. The information must disclose a cognizable offence
	3. If that information is led before an officer in charge of a police station, the police officer has no other option except to enter the  same in the prescribed form.
The use of the word *shall* in 154(1) shows the legislative intent that it is *mandatory* to register an FIR
