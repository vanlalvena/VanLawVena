For a series of acts to be regarded as forming the *same transaction*, they must be **connected in some way**; there must be **continuity of action**. (**Para 22**)

*Consequence test*: If an offence which forms part of the second FIR ***arises as a consequence of the first FIR***, then the offences covered by both the FIRs are same (**Para 58**)

Claims of cheating by successive complainants or victims under the same conspiracy need not be a *consequence* of the offence alleged in the first FIR since *it was open to the accused not to proceed to commit the subsequent offence*.  (**Para 58**)

Practice of registering one FIR is untenable in law and deprives the victims and complainants of their rights (**Para 60**)
	The others would at best, only be witnesses to establish the conspiracy;
	It denies victims of the right to file protest petition, Seek cancellation of bail
	The accused may be inclined to to enter into a settlement / compromise only with the complainant and not the other victims

In a case of inducement, allurement and cheating of a large number of investors/ depositors in pursuance to a criminal conspiracy, *each deposit by an investor constitute a separate and individual transaction*. (**Para 62**)
	The State must register a **separate FIR**

In respect of each separate FIR, there must be a separate final report (**Paras 76, 77, 80**)

Section 31(2) has no application when there are multiple trials which result in multiple convictions (**Para 82**)
