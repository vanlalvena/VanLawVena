Case Name : ***Directorate of Enforcement vs Abdullah Ali Balsharaf & Ors***
Case Reference: (2019) 3 RCR (Criminal) 566 : MANU/DE/1138/2019 : 2019 SCC OnLine Del 7942

Though CrPC is a general procedural law applicable to all criminal matters, nothing therein  is to affect any special law or special jurisdiction or special power or special form of procedure prescribed by any other law that may be in force .

[[PMLA - Section 65]] is a *residuary procedural blueprint*; and for matters relating to **arrest, search, attachment, confiscation, investigation, prosecution** and ***all other proceedings under PMLA***,  CrPC will apply *as long as there is nothing inconsistent with provisions of CrPC and PMLA*. 

[[CrPC - Section 102]] is to be read to bring it in line with the mandatory requirements of [[PMLA - Section 17]].

The expatiation on *reason to believe* as under [[IPC, Section 26]] in the context of an accused in [[Joti Prasad vs State of Haryana]] ***also apply to an officer in exercise of their powers***.

When a statute stipulates that an action may be taken by an officer only when there is reason to believe to do so; *especially when there are stringent procedures laid down*, **the requirement of having reason to believe must be strictly complied with**. 

The essence of the definition contained in [[IPC, Section 26]] must inform the interpretation of *reason to believe* as present in [[PMLA - Section 17]].

The phrase *reason to believe* has a specific connotation in criminal jurisprudence **and is not merely an ordinary and colloquial phrase**.

Where a power is given to do a thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all; other methods of performance of that act are necessarily forbidden.
This principle applies to a special statute such as [[PMLA]].

The ingredients of [[PMLA - Section 17]] must necessarily and scrupulously be complied with; it is impermissible for seizure to be made by instead relying on [[CrPC - Section 102]].

**Whenever there is any provision covering any aspect of proceedings under the [[PMLA]], such provisions would prevail and must be adhered to** *regardless of any cognate provision contained in the [[CrPC]]* 
	Where the PMLA does no specific provision on a certain point, the provisions of CrPC may be relied upon as *residuary provisions*
	In case of any conflict of contradiction; **those contained in the PMLA would prevail** and those of the CrPC would *yield*.

	The effect of [[CrPC - Section 5]] is to exclude the application of the Code of Criminal Procedure to any proceedings under any special or local law or any special jurisdiction or form of procedure prescribed by any other law.
[[Gautam Kundu vs DoE]], (2015) 16 SCC 1
	The conditions under [[PMLA - Section 45]] have to be complied even when an application for bail has been filed under [[CrPC - Section 439]]; the latter would therefore have to *yield* to the former. 
[[Joti Prasad vs State of Haryana]], (1993) Supp (2) SCC 497
	Knowledge is an awareness on the part of the person concerned indicating his state of mind.
	***Knowledge will be slightly on higher plane than reason to believe***. 
	Reason to believe is another facet of the state of mind and is not the same thing as suspicion or doubt; **mere seeing cannot be equated to believing**. *Reason to believe is a higher level of state of mind*. 
		Reason to believe require that that the circumstances must be such that:
			1.  a reasonable man would
			2. by probable reasoning
			3. conclude or infer regarding the nature of the thing circumstances
		**Such circumstances need not be of absolute conviction or inference**. It is sufficient *if the circumstances are such creating* a ***cause to believe*** by *chain of probable reasoning* leading to conclusion or inference about the nature of the thing.

	*Reason to believe* on the part of the officer concerned **is essentially a question of fact**
