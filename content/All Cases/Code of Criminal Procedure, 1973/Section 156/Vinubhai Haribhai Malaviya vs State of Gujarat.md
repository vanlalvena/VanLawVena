Magistrate has the power to order further investigation *even* after chargesheet is filed and cognizance is taken

[[Constitution - Article 21]] mandates that all powers necessary to ensure proper investigation are available to the Magistrate. (**Para 19**)
	This power continues until trial commences

Investigation under [[CrPC - Section 156]](1), as per [[CrPC - Section 2]](h) includes all proceedings for collection of evidence conducted by a police officer and includes proceedings by way of further investigation under [[CrPC - Section 173]](8) (**Para 23**)

When the police files a closure report, the Magistrate has three options (**Para 28**):
	1. Accept the report and drop the proceedings;
	2. Disagree with the report and take cognizance of the offence and issue process;
	3. Direct further investigation 

On balancing necessity of further investigation and with delaying criminal trial; interests of justice is paramount and the latter will give way to the former (**Para 29**)
