Case Number: Crl A No 600/2007
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 03
Coram: TS Thakur, Adarsh Kumar Goel (Author, R Banumathi

Entry regarding information relating to cognizable offence under [[CrPC - Section 154]] is an FIR; First Information Report. On suspecting commission of offence, officer empowered to investigate may investigate and take measures for discovery and arrest of offender under [[CrPC, Section 157]](1) subject to compliance of other requirements (**Para 16**)
	Such as [[Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar]] in [[CrPC - Section 41A]]
	Power of *arrest or investigation* is ***not mechanical*** and *requires application of mind* in the manner provided. (**Para 19**)

Direction for investigation under [[CrPC - Section 156]](3) cannot be mechanical (**Para 20**)

Direction to register FIR is to be issued only on application of mind by the Magistrate (**Para 22**)
	1. 	When the Magistrate *does not take cognisance* and does *not find it necessary to postpone issuance of process* (under [[CrPC - Section 202]]); but that there is a case to direct investigation, an order under [[CrPC - Section 156]](3) may be directed.

Explanation of the maxim *expressio unius est exclusion alterious* which means ***express mention of one thing excludes others***.
	[[Mary Angel vs State of Tamil Nadu]]

The above maxim does not apply to [[CrPC - Section 202]](3)  (**Para 24** at *Page 309*)

**Admissibility of confession cannot guide exercise power of arrest**. The source of power of arrest is *not* [[Evidence - Section 27]], but [[CrPC - Section 41]] or under a warrant. ***Police cannot*** *on its own* ***exercise the power of arrest in the course of making its report in pursuance to a direction under [[CrPC - Section 202]]*** (**Para 24,25**)

When from the facts it appeared that it was a civil dispute, the Magistrate was correct in proceeding under [[CrPC - Section 202]] instead of [[CrPC - Section 156]](3). (**Para 30, 33**)

The power under [[CrPC - Section 156]](3) can be invoked before taking cognisance and is in the nature of pre-emptory reminder or intimation to the police to exercise its plenary power of investigation which begins with investigation under [[CrPC - Section 156]] and ends with a report or chargesheet under [[CrPC - Section 173]] (**Para 34, 35**)

	Accused has no right to be heard at the stage of inquiry

[[content/All Cases/Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973/Section 156/Anil Kumar vs MK Aiyappa]], (2013) 10 SCC 705
	(**Para 11**) - The Magistrate cannot refer the matter against a public servant without a valid sanction order; the Magistrate is required to apply his mind on applications under [[CrPC - Section 156]](3) or [[CrPC - Section 200]]. *Mere statement that the Magistrate has gone through the complaint, documents and heard the complainant* **will not be sufficient**.
		The order must reflect what weighs with the Magistrate to order investigation under [[CrPC - Section 156]](3); though a ***detailed expression of his views is neither required nor warranted***
