### Whether date of remand is to be included or excluded in claim for default bail under 167(2) CrPC 

Main para - (**Para 34**)
	The period of custody with the police prior to remand is ***not detention***. (*Page 19*)
	==The period of detention by the Magistrate runs from the day of the remand order==
		The date of remand is when the period under section 167 starts, ***irrespective of the time of the day*** (*Page 20*)
			Example of if accused is produced at 11.50PM (**Paras 48, 50**)
				**It is the date that counts**; ==as long as the application is filed before the chargesheet is filed, the accused would be entitled to bail==

Right to default bail is a *fundamental right* (**Para 38**)

Accused does not have to make out substantive groudns for bail or file detailed bail application, but only state in an application (*orally or written*) (**Para 38**)

### Interpretation of Penal Statutes

Whenever there is an ambiguity, it *must be read in favour of the accused* (**Paras 40-41**)
