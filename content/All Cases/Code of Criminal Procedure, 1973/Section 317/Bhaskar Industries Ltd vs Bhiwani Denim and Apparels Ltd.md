Evidence is normally to be taken in the presence of the accused (**Page 226; E**)

Evidence can be taken in the absence of the accused who has been granted exemption from attending the court, but his counsel must be present (**Page 226; E-F**)

In Summons Cases, the appearance at the stage of section 251 can be by personal attendance or through advocate (**Page 227; B-F**)

If the counsel engaged by the accused does not appear, the Magistrate can resort to 205(2). (**Page 227; G-H**)

The discretion to exempt personal presence is to be exercised only in rare instances (**Page 228; B-D**):
	1. Far distance at which accused resides, carries on business
	2. Due to physical or other good reasons
