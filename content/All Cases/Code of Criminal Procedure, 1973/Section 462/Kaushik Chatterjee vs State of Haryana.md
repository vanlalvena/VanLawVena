### Jurisdiction of criminal courts

Summarising principles regarding *jurisdiction of criminal courts* (**Para 21**)
	The expression ‘local jurisdiction’ as mentioned in [[CrPC - Section 177]] is defined in section [[CrPC - Section 2]](j) (**Para 21(1)**)

Jurisdiction of a criminal court can be relatable to an offence or the offender. (**Para 33**)

Question of jurisdiction with respect to the ***power of the court to try particular kinds of offences*** *goes into the root of the matter* (**Para 36**)
	1. ***Territorial jurisdiction*** is a *matter of convenience*.
	2. Where a Magistrate has the power to try a particular offence, but the controversy relates *solely to his territorial jurisdiction*, the case would be saved by the saving clause under [[CrPC - Section 462]] (**Para 37**)
		Lack of jurisdiction to *try an offence* makes the proceedings void (**Para 38**)
		Lac of jurisdiction to *try an offender* can be saved by [[CrPC - Section 462]] (**Para 38**)
			The exception being [[CrPC - Section 461]](l); where the law expressly bars or provides trial of an offender by certain courts.
