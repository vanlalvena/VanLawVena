Neutral Citation:
Case Number: 
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 05
Coram: Chief Justice YV Chandrachud (*Author*), PN Bhagwati, NL Untwalia, RS Pathak, O Chinnappa Reddy
Date: 09.04.1980

Limited custody , deemed custody for recovery
Filing of FIR not condition precedent for anticipatory bail (**Para 35**)

### Bail and Anticipatory Bail

Distinction or difference ordinary bail and anticipatory bail (**Para 7** at 575)
	Ordinary Bail
		Granted *after* arrest; means release from custody of the police
	Anticipatory Bail
		Granted *in anticipation* of arrest; effect at the moment of arrest 

### Judicial Discretion

Judicial discretion should be free and wide, laying down rigid rules hampers such discretion (**Paras 14, 15**)
	Discretion should not be fettered or restricted when the statute has no such limitation

#### Whether bar on offences with serious punishment up to life/death

When section 438 does not differentiate non-bailable offences based on the potential punishment, there can be no restrictions on 438 (**Para 18**)
> Side Note: This would be subject to some special statute having some clause to that effect barring anticipatory bail; *see* [[SCST - Section 18]]
