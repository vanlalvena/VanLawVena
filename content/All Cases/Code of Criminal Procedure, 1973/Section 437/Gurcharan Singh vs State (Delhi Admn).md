Cancellation of bail #incomplete 

Sessions court and High court are to also consider mandate of law of bail under section 437 (**Page 365, E-F**)

Sessions Court cannot cancel bail given by High Court (**Page 364, C**)
	However, HC can cancel bail given by sessions court.
	Sessions court can also cancel bail given by it; however, if no new circumstances exist, then it is better to move HC for cancellation of bail

==Unless exceptional circumstances exist==, *court will not ordinarily deny bail* (**Page 365, H**)

Considerations for grant of bail (**Page 367, E-G**)

*Trustworthiness of evidence* is not an issue to be decided at the time of bail (**Page 369, B-C**)

Two paramount considerations for bail: (**Page 369, E**)
1) Accused absconding
2) Tampering of evidence
