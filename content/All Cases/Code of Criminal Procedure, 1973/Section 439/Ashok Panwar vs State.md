Case Number: BA 1606/2020
Court: Delhi High Court
Bench: 01

Pre-trial detention has an adverse effect on an accused, especially on his right to brief and consult lawyers and to prepare their defence; and the accused must be a given a real and not merely chimerical right to fair trial as guaranteed under [[Constitution - Article 21]].
Once investigation is complete and chargesheet has been filed, it would ***be difficult to discern any other threshold or timeline upon which it would be ‘proper’ to detain an undertrial in judicial custody.***
Any ad-hocism in deciding *appropriate pre-trial detention period* would be anathema to the rule of law.
**Judicial subjectivity must never be confused with an individual judge’s whim**

	Courts are **not** to presume that the accused would flee from justice.
	The **nature of the offence** has a *limited role* while examining merits on application for bail. Since it is *not an application for suspension of sentence*. 
		Courts must be alive to the position that ***every accused is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty.***
[[Sanjay Chandra vs CBI]], (2012) 1 SCC 40
	*Object of bail* is to *secure the appearance of the accused person at trial.*
		*Object of bail* is **neither punitive nor preventative**.
	Deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment; and ordinarily punishment begins after conviction.
	Necessity is the operative test; to ensure attendance of some un-convicted undertrial at the trial, or that such person could tamper with the witnesses if left at liberty.
		There must be material in support of the allegation as to the possibility of tampering of witnesses.
	It would be improper for any court to refuse bail as a mark of disapproval of former conduct.
	It is also improper to refuse bail to the un-convicted undertrial for the purpose of giving them a taste of imprisonment as a lesson.
	Seriousness of charge is one of the considerations but **not the only test or factor**

	Gravity can only beget the length of sentence.
	Bail cannot be thwarted simply by asserting that the offence is grave.
