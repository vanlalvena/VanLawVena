Case Reference: (2012) 9 SCC 446 : (2012) 7 SCR 584
Case Number: 
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 02
Coram: KS Radhakrishnan, Dipak Misra (author)
Date: 20.09.2012

Heinous nature of crime warrants more caution
Court must keep in mind not only nature of accusations, but **severity of punishment**, if accusation entails conviction and nature of evidence in support of accusation
Reasonable apprehensions of the **witnesses being tampered** with or the apprehension of there being a **threat for the complainant** should also weigh with the court in the matter of grant of bail. 
While it is not expected to have the entire evidence establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt but *there ought always to be a prima facie satisfaction of the court in support of the charge*. 
Frivolity in prosecution should always be considered and it is only the **element of genuineness that shall have to be considered in the matter of grant of bail**, and in the event of there being some doubt as to the genuineness of the prosecution, in the ***normal course of events, the accused is entitled to an order of bail***.
