Mere denial of a debt or liability cannot shift the burden of proof from the accused in a case of dishonour of cheque. (**Para 19**)

When the accused raises a probable defence which creates doubt with regard to the existence of a debt or liability, the presumption may fail (**Para 21**)

	In exercise of revisional jurisdiction, the court can interfere only when the order is *perverse*, *wholly unreasonable*, or there is *non-consideration of any relevant material*.
[[Kumar Exports vs Sharma Carpets]]. (2009) 2 SCC 513
	**Presumptions are devices by use of which courts are enabled and entitled to pronounce on an issue** *notwithstanding that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence*.
	All presumptions come under one of three classes:
		1. “May presume” - Rebuttable
		2. “Shall presume” - Rebuttable
		3. “Conclusive presumptions” - Irrebuttable
		The term “presumption” is used to designate an inference affirmative or dis-affirmative of the existence of a fact; this presumed fact is drawn by a judicial tribunal by a process of *probable reasoning* **from some matter of fact** either ***judicially noticed, admitted, or established by legal evidence***.
			Presumption means **taking as true without examination or proof**
		Applying the definition of ‘proved’ in [[Evidence - Section 3]], as soon as the complainant discharges the burden to prove that the instrument was executed by the accused, *the rules of presumptions* under [[NI Act - Section 118]] and [[NI Act - Section 139]] shift the burden on the accused.
			These presumptions live, exist and survive and end **only when the contrary is proved by the accused**.
				*That the cheque was not issued for consideration and in discharge of any debt or liability*.
		***A presumption is not in itself evidence*** but only *makes a prima facie case* for a party for whose benefit it exists
	The presumptions under [[NI Act - Section 118]] and [[NI Act - Section 139]] are rebuttable ([[Evidence, Section 4]])
	The accused may adduce evidence to rebut the presumption but **mere denial regarding existence of debt will not serve any purpose**; but the accused need not disprove the non-existence of consideration and debt by leading evidence *because the existence of negative evidence is neither possible nor contemplated*.
		The court, upon consideration of facts and circumstances brought on record by the accused may either believe that the *consideration and debt did not exist* ***or*** that their *non-existence was so probable that a prudent man would under the circumstances of the case, act upon the plea that they did not exist*
[[Rangappa vs Sri Mohan]], (2010) 11 SCC 441 {**03 Judge Bench**}
	When the accused raises a probable defence which creates doubt with regard to the existence of a debt or liability, the presumption may fail.
	The rebuttable presumption under [[NI Act - Section 139]] is a device to prevent undue delay in the course of litigation.
	The offence punishable under [[NI Act - Section 138]] can be better described as a **regulatory offence** since the bouncing of a cheque is largely in the nature of a civil wrong whose impact is usually confined to the private parties involved in commercial transactions.
		The defendant-accused cannot be expected to discharge an unduly high standard of proof.
