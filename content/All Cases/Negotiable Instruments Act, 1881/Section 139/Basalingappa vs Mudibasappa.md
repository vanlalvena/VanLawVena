Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 02

When the complainant is the holder of the cheque and the signature on the cheque is not denied, presumption is to be drawn that the cheque was issued for discharge of any debt or liability. This presumption [[NI Act - Section 139]] is rebuttable. [[NI Act - Section 139]] is an example of reverse onus.

The standard of proof for rebutting the presumption is that of preponderance of probabilities.
It is open for the accused to rely on evidence led by him or to rely on materials submitted by the complainant in order to raise a probable defence.
Inference of preponderance of probabilities can be drawn not only from the materials brought on record by the parties *but also by reference to the circumstances upon which they rely*

**It is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness box to support his defence**

A complainant in a cheque bounce case is bound to explain his financial capacity, when the same is questioned by the accused, by leading evidence to that effect
