Case Name : ***ANSS Rajashekar vs Augustus Jeba Ananth***
Case Reference: AIR 2019 SC 942 : (2020) 15 SCC 348 : (2019) 1 SCR 731
Case Number:  Crl A Nos. 95-96/2019
Court: Supreme Court
Bench: 02
Coram:  DY Chandrachud (Author), MR Shah

Though [[NI Act - Section 139]] mandates a presumption that the holder ([[NI Act - Section 8]]; i.e., *the person whose name is on the cheque and is to receive the amount*) of a cheque received such cheque so that some debt or liability, **in part or in whole**, is discharged by the drawer ([[NI Act - Section 7]]); this ***presumption is rebuttable***.
Terming this as a “reverse onus clause”, it was held that the prosecution can fail if the accused is able to raise a probable defence which creates doubts about the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability. The accused can rely on the materials submitted by the complainant.

Refer also:
[[Rangappa vs Sri Mohan]], (2010) 11 SCC 441 {**03 Judge Bench**} - In determining whether the presumption under [[NI Act - Section 139]] has been rebutted, the test of proportionality must guide the determination. The standard of proof to rebut the presumption is of *preponderance of probabilities*.
