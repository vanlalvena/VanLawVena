It must be *specifically averred* in the complaint under [[NI Act - Section 141]] that at the time the offence was committed, the person accused was in charge of, and responsible for the conduct of business of the company.  (**Page 386,G**)

Merely being a director is not sufficient to make the person liable under [[NI Act - Section 141]]. A director *cannot be deemed* to be in charge of and responsible to the company for conduct of its business. There is no deemed liability. The person must be in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business *at the relevant time*  (**Page 386,H - 387,A-B**)

However, with respect to the Managing Director or Joint Managing Director, they can be proceeded against even in the absence of a specific averment since they would clearly be responsible for the incriminating act. So also for the signatory of a dishonoured cheque (**Page 387,B-D**)
