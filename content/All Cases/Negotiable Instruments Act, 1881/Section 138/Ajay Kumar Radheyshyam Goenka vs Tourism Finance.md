Proceedings under [[NI Act]] are penal in nature, it is not recovery of the amount with interest as a debt recovery proceedings would be. It is not akin to suit proceedings. (**Para 16**)

The process under [[IBC]] does not *ipso facto* apply to extinguishment to criminal proceedings.

Appellant was signatory of the cheque as also the Promoter and Managing Director.

Just because proceedings against the company come to an end does not mean that the Appellant as the Managing Director cannot be proceeded against (**Para 18**). Proceedings under [[NI Act - Section 138]] are not primarily compensatory in nature.
The criminal liability and fines are built on principle of not honouring a negotiable instrument which accepts trade. (**Para 18**)
	**It is apart from the principal of financial liability per se**
