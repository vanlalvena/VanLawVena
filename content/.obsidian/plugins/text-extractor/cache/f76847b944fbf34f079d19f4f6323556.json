SUMITRI DEVI 715 require a closer scrutiny insofar as they are to be applied to a proceeding arising out of a reference under Section 10 or 10-A of the Industrial Disputes a Act which would stand on a different footing. 3. The moot question would arise whether the ratio of the Constitution Bench judgment in Kalyani case3 would almost automatically apply to such cases apart from the cases arising under Section 33 of the I.D. Act. We may, in this connection, mention that the decision of the three-Judge Bench of this Court in Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd. v. Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha5 b wherein Krishna Iyer, J., spoke for the majority, was an authority on the question of leading evidence before the Industrial Court in proceedings under Section 10-A of the Act and on the question of relation back of ultimate penalty order passed by the arbitrator on the basis of evidence led by the management for justification of its action before such Tribunal. Therefore, the question would arise whether the ratio of this decision would c still apply to a case where the proceedings relate to Section 10 or 10-A of the Act apart from Section 33 of the Act. The later decisions of this Court have applied the ratio of the decision in Kalyani case3 to matters arising under Sections 10 and 10-A of the Act. In our view, therefore, the dispute in the present proceedings could be better resolved by a Constitution Bench of this Court which can consider the scope and ambit of the decision of the earlier d Constitution Bench judgment in Kalyani case3 which has been the sheet- anchor of the subsequent cases referred to earlier on which a strong reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the petitioner and which had nothing to do with proceedings under Section 33 of the Act. The later decisions of this Court will also, therefore, require a relook. 4. Leave granted. e 5. The appeals will now be placed for final disposal before a Constitution Bench of this Court pursuant to the present order. 6. Printing dispensed with. All the relevant documents are permitted to be filed by the parties concerned. 7. Notice to issue on the prayer for interim relief. There will be ad interim stay of the order of the Division Bench of the High Court to the f extent of 50% of the back wages. g (1997) 8 Supreme Court Cases 715 (BEFOREDRA.S. ANAND AND S.

The appellant later filed an application for execution of the decree. The executing court upheld a preliminary objection of the respondent judgment-debtor b that the application was barred by time. But a Single Judge of the High Court (Gupta, J.) allowed a revision petition filed against the order of the executing court and held that the revision petition was not covered by Article 182 of the J&K Limitation Act and was not barred by time. Thereupon the respondent filed a review petition before the High Court. Another Single Judge (Sharma, J.) while observing that there was a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record which was not of such a nature, \"which had to be detected by a long-drawn process of reasons\", c held \"that the decree in question was of composite nature wherein both mandatory and prohibitory injunctions were provided\" and as such the case was covered by Article 182 and not Article 181. Thus allowing the review petition the Single Judge (Sharma, J.) set at naught the revisional order and restored the order of the executing court. Allowing the appeal Held: Under Order 47, Rule 1 CPC a judgment may be open to review inter alia if d there is a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record. An error which is not self-evident and has to be detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record justifying the court to exercise its power of review under Order 47, Rule 1 CPC. In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 47, Rule 1 CPC it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be \"reheard and corrected\". There is a clear distinction between an erroneous decision and an error apparent on the face of the record. While the first can be corrected by the higher forum, the latter only can be corrected by exercise of the review jurisdiction. A review petition has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be \"an appeal in disguise\". (Paras 9 and 10) Thungabhadra Industries Ltd. v.

This appeal by special leave calls in question an order passed by a Single Judge (G.D. Sharma, J.) of the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir on 6-3-1997 in exercise of the review jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. The learned Judge \"upset\" the findings recorded on 25-4-1989 in Civil Revision No. 87 of 1987 by another Single Judge (K.K. Gupta, J.) of that Court. 2. Shorn of details, brief facts necessary for disposal of this appeal are that on 28-11-1977 a suit, filed by the appellants, was decreed and an injunction was issued to the defendant-respondents to close down the passage carved out by opening a door from the wall and further the defendants were restrained from using that passage. On 7-8-1986 an application for execution of the decree was filed in the Executing Court on the ground that the injunctions were being violated. The judgment-debtor filed objections to the execution application and raised a preliminary objection to the effect that the execution application was barred by time. The Executing Court vide order dated 6-5-1987 upheld the preliminary objection and held the execution application to be barred by time. The matter was taken up in revision to the High Court. On 25-4-1989, the civil revision petition against the order of the Executing Court was allowed. Gupta, J. allowing the civil revision petition held that the case was covered by Article 181 of the Jammu & Kashmir Limitation Act and the opinion of the Executing Court that it was covered by Article 182 of the Jammu & Kashmir Limitation Act was erroneous. It was held that the petition was not barred by time. The execution application was remanded to the Executing Court for decision on merits.

Mr Ranjit Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the appellant a submitted that the impugned order is vitiated as it transgresses the powers of review available to the Court under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. He submitted that the review petition had been treated as if it was an appeal. He also referred to the grounds of the review application and urged that on none of those grounds was the review of the order dated 25-4-1989 justified. 4. Mr M.L. Bhat, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents, b on the other hand submitted that the review court had only set right the mistake committed by Gupta, J. by correct interpretation of the decree and the application of the relevant article of the Limitation Act to the facts of the case and that exercise could not be faulted. He asserted that Sharma, J. had rightly set aside the order of Gupta, J. dated 25-4-1989 and upheld the order of the Executing Court dated 6-5-1987. c 5. We have given our thoughtful considerations to the respective submissions raised at the Bar. 6. A perusal of the application filed by the judgment-debtors seeking review of the order dated 25-4-1989 shows that none of the grounds stated therein can strictly speaking be said to fall within the ambit and scope of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. The review petition in effect challenged the d correctness of the order of Gupta, J. on the question of limitation without pointing out any '\"error apparent on the face of the record\" which could have been reviewed. Sharma, J. appears to have ignored the limits of the exercise of jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC while passing the impugned order and reversing the order of Gupta, J. on merits. 7. It is well settled that review proceedings have to be strictly confined e to the ambit and scope of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. In Thungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. Govt. of A.P. 1 (SCR at p. 186) this Court opined: \"What, however, we are now concerned with is whether the statement in the order of September 1959 that the case did not involve any substantial question of law is an 'error apparent on the face of the record'). The fact that on the earlier occasion the Court held on an f identical state of facts that a substantial question of law arose would not per se be conclusive, for the earlier order itself might be erroneous. Similarly, even if the statement was wrong, it would not follow that it was an 'error apparent on the face of the record', for there is a distinction which is real, though it might not always be capable of exposition, between a mere erroneous decision and a decision which g could be characterised as vitiated by 'error apparent'. A review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected, but lies only for patent error.\" (emphasis ours) 8. Again, in Meera Bhanja v. Nirmala Kumari Choudhury2 while quoting with approval a passage from Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v.

SUMITRI DEVI 719 Pishak Sharma3 this Court once again held that review proceedings are not by way of an appeal and have to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit a of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. 9. Under Order 47 Rule l CPC a judgment may be open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record. An error which is not self-evident and has to be detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record justifying the court to exercise its power of review under Order 47 b Rule I CPC. In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 4 7 Rule 1 CPC it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be \"reheard and corrected\". A review petition, it must be remembered has a limited purpose and cannot be a11owed to be \"an appeal in disguise\". 10. Considered in the light of this settled position we find that Sharma, J. clearly overstepped the jurisdiction vested in the Court under Order 47 c Rule I CPC. The observations of Sharma, J. that \"accordingly, the order in question is reviewed and it is held that the decree in question was of composite nature wherein both mandatory and prohibitory injunctions were provided\" and as such the case was covered by Article 182 and not Article 181 cannot be said to fall within the scope of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. There is a clear distinction between an erroneous decision and an error apparent on d the face of the record. While the first can be corrected by the higher forum, the latter only can be corrected by exercise of the review jurisdiction. While passing the impugned order, Sharma, J. found the order in Civil Revision dated 25-4-1989 as an erroneous decision, though without saying so in so many words. Indeed, while passing the impugned order Shanna, J. did record that there was a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record e which was not of such a nature, \"which had to be detected by a long-drawn process of reasons\" and proceeded to set at naught the order of Gupta, J. However, mechanical use of statutorily sanctified phrases cannot detract from the real import of the order passed in exercise of the review jurisdiction. Recourse to review petition in the facts and circumstances of the case was not permissible. The aggrieved judgment-debtors could have f approached the higher forum through appropriate proceedings to assail the order of Gupta, J. and get it set aside but it was not open to them to seek a \"review\" of the order of Gupta, J. on the grounds detailed in the review petition. In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the impugned order of Shanna, J. cannot be sustained and we accordingly accept this appeal and set aside the impugned order dated 6-3-1997. 11. As a consequence of the setting aside of the impugned order, the g remand order made by Gupta, J. would automatically stand revived but that in our opinion also does not solve the problem. h 12. We find that neither the Executing Court nor Gupta, J. while deciding the civil revision petition have recorded any finding as to the date or the time when the decree was allegedly breached.
