SHRI RAJINDER SINGH 1 15 (1979) DELHI LAW TIMES 1 DELHI HIGH COURT Mr. Justice Avadh Behari Rohatgi SMT. KARMA WALI—Petitioner versus SHRI RAJINDER SINGH—Respondent Suit No. S.A.O. 190/78––Decided on Sept. 8th 1978. (i) Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, Section 25B(3)—Obligatory on the Court to issue summons by registered post in addition to ordinary manner. Held: That under Sub-section (3) of S. 25B of the Act, service by registered post is in addition to and simultaneously with, the ordinary manner of service. The two go together and are identical in time. It is obligatory on the Controller to issue summons by registered postal so, as is clear from the expression used “in addition to and simultaneously with” as also from the words “shall” and “also”, in the sub-section, Again, under Sub-section (4) of Section 25B the tenant must be duly served (whether in the ordinary way or by registered post) in the form specified in the third schedule, before an order of eviction can be passed. (Paras 13 & 14) (ii) Delhi Rent Control Act,1958 Sections 25B(8) 38 and 39—No appeal or second appeal from order under Section 25B lies. Held: That no appeal udner Section 38 or second appeal under S. 39 lies from an order passed under Section 25B, only revision lies under Sub- section (8) of Section 25B. (Paras 7 & 10) Held further: That an order passed on an application under O. 9, Rule 13, C.P.C. for setting aside an ex parte order made under Section 25B(4) is not open to appeal or second appeal, but only to revision under Section 25B(8). (Pars 7 & 19) (iii) No party can be permitted to take inconsistent posi- tions in Court. The tenant-respondent filed a revision in the High Court under S. 25B(8) of the Act against an order against him under O. 9, R. 13, C.P.C., by the Additional Rent Controller. He also filed an appeal before the Rent Control Tribunal under Section 38 of the Act against the said order. In revision the landlady contended that the same was incompetent, the order being appealable and the same was dismissed, while in the appeal she raised no objection as to its maintainability and the same was accep- ted and the case remanded for decision as to due service after recording evidence of the parties. Against this order passed in appeal, she filed a second appeal in the High Court, under Section 39 of the Act, and conten- ded that the order under Order 9, Rule 13 was not appealable, but was open to revision only. THE DELHI LAW TIMES Vol. 15—1979 ––––O–––– 2 THE DELHI LAW TIMES 1979 Held: That it is well- settled that a party litigant cannot be per- mitted to assume positions in the Court, to play fast and loose, to blow hot and cold, to approbate and reprobate, to the detriment of his opponent. The appeal was accordingly dismissed by the High Court. (Paras 8 and 9) (iv) Delhi Rent Control Act, —Section 25B(3)/(4)—Ex parte order. Held: That on a plain reading of Section 25B it cannot be said that the order passed against the absent tenant is anything other than an ex parte order. A failure to appear “in pursuance of the summons is one thing; but where the tenant is not served with summons he cannot be expected to appear and defend the case. An order passed under S. 25B (4) without valid service can be challenged by an application under Order 9, Rule 13, C.P.C. (Paras 15 and 16) (v) Delhi Rent Control Act,1958 Sections 25(B), 38, 39––Interferance by High Court in appeal or revision. Held: That the High Court is not bound to interfere in appeal with an order of the Tribunal, though illegal and without jurisdiction, where the justice of the case does not so require, especially when the objection was not taken before the Tribunal and substantial justice has been done. Moreover, no appeal is maintainable under Section 39 in an order made in proceedings under s. 25(B) in view of s. 25B(8). An appeal or second appeal is expressly barred. The High Court also cannot treat such an appeal as revision, for under Sub-section (8) of Section 25B, it is only the order of the Controller which can be examined by the High Court to see that it is according to law, and not that of the Tribunal.

The petitioner Smt. Karma Wali is the landlady. The respondent Mr. Rajinder Singh is her te- nant in the ground floor of house No. F-20, Rajouri Garden at a rent of Rs 140 per month. VOL.XV SMT. KARMA WALI v. SHRI RAJINDER SINGH 3 2. On October 7, 1976 the landlady brought a petition for the eviction of the tenant on the ground of personal bona fide necessity spe- cified in Clause (e) of proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (The Act). The Additional Controller tried the petition under the newly introduced procedure of Section 25(B), of the Act. Summons were issued to the tenant. He did not appear. He made no application for leave to defend the case. The Additional Controller, deeming the allegations in the eviction petition to have been admitted to be correct, passed the eviction order against the tenant on February 21, 1977. 3. On April 12, 1977 the tenant received a notice dated March 31, 1977 from the landlady. From this he came to know that an ex parte eviction order had been passed against him on February 21, 1977. On April 14, 1977 he made an application to the Additional Controller un- der Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the ex parte decree. The landlady opposed. The Additional Controller dismissed the application on July 16, 1977 holding, inter alia, that the tenant had been sufficiently served by publication in the newspaper and that there was no ground for setting aside the eviction order. 4. The tenant was perplexed. He did not know what to do. By way of abundant caution he took nearly all the courses open to him in law. He pursued as many as three remedies. Firstly, on August 24, 1977 the tenant filed a revision petition in this Court. under Section 25(8) of the Act against the eviction order dated February 21, 1977. Secondly, on that very date he filed another revi- sion petition against the order of the Additional Controller dated July 16, 1977 dismissing the application under Order 9 Rule 13, C.P.C. Thirdly, on October 13, 1977 he filed an appeal in the Rent Control Tribunal under Section 38 of the Act against the Additional Controller’s order dated July 16, 1977. 5. The two revision petitions were he hard by D.K. Kapur, J. He dismissed both of them on 13 th December, 1977. As regards the revision against the Additional Controller’s order refusing to set aside the eviction order he held that since an appeal was pending before the Rent Control Tribunal, “this matter can be agitated there”. On the revision against the eviction order he took much the same view. He said: “In any case as there is still an appeal pending before the Rent Control Tribunal concerned (against) the application under Order 9. Rule 13, all the points on merits can still be agitated before that authority and, therefore, this revision does not seem to be right remedy”. dismissed, as I have said. 6. Now came the appeal for hearing before the Rent Control Tribunal. The Tribunal allowed the appeal on May 10, 1978. It took the view that the Additional Controller ought to have afforded an opportunity to the tenant to prove that he was never served in the case and that he should not have dismissed the petition summarily. The Tribunal, therefore, remanded the case to the Additional Controller for deciding it in accordance with law after affording an opportunity 4 THE DELHI LAW TIMES 1979 for leading evidence to both the parties. It is this order which is now the subject of complaint in this second appeal. 7. Counsel for the landlady’s principal submission is that the order of the Tribunal is without jurisdiction as no appeal is provided under Sub-section (8) of Section 25 B and the only remedy was a revi- sion which was availed of but without success. It is true that no appeal lies to the Tribunal under Section 38 [Section Section 25B (8) of the Act]. I have so held in Rule K. Parikh v. Smt. Uma Verma (Cr. 577 of 1977) decided on August 2, 1978. 8. One main question arises on this submission. And that is about the justice of the plea. Counsel for the landlady at the time of hearing of the revisions by Kapur J. that the position that “the order dismissing the application under Order 9. Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure is appealable under Order 43 Rule 1(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure and, therefore, the present petition is not maintainable”. I am quoting the words of the landlady from her reply to the stay appli- cation dated September 17, 1977. From the order of Kapur, J., also it is clear that that was the chief submission and that it prevailed. Now when the tenant goes to the Tribunal and his appeal is allowed the landlady turns round and says that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction. See the inequity of the submission. When the tenant goes to the High Court in revision his revisions are dismissed on the ground that his appeal is pending before the Tribunal. When he goes to the Tribunal and succeeds in the appeal it is argued against him that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear and decide the tenant’s appeal. it is well settled that a party litigant cannot be permitted to assume inconsistent positions in Court, to play fast and loose, to blow hot and cold, to approbate and reprobate, to the detriment of his opponent; and that this wholesome doctrine applies to the successive stages of the same suit. 9. This principle is stated by Bigelow in these words:— “If parties in Court were permitted to assume inconsistent positions in the trial of their causes, the usefulness of Courts of justice would in most cases be paralysed, the coercive process of the law available only between those who consented to exer- cise, could be set at naught by all. But the rights of all men, honest and dishonest, are in the keeping of the Courts and con- sistency of proceedings is, therefore, required of all those who come or are brought before them. It may accordingly be laid down as a broad proposition that one who, without mistake induced by the opposite party, has taken a particular position deliberately in the course of litigation must act consistently with it; one cannot play fast and loose.” See Hemanta Kumari Devi v. Prasanna Kumar. AIR 1930 Cal. 32, Indermill v. Sub-Judge, Secunderabad, AIR 1958 AP 779 (781), Amrit Lal N. Shah v. Alla Annapurnamma, AIR 1959 AP 14 and Kartar Singh v. Nanda, AIR 1926 All. 664. If inconsistent positions were to be permitted litigation would have no end except when legal ingenuity is exhausted. In my opinion the action of the land- lady herself has precluded her from raising the objection to jurisdiction VOL.XV SMT. KARMA WALI v. SHRI RAJINDER SINGH 5 of the Tribunal (Sara Bibi v. Chandrapal Singh, AIR 1928 Oudh 503). 10. At this stage it is necessary to state in brief outline the tenant’s case. His case is that the order of eviction dated February 21, 1977 is an ex parte order and can be set aside or reviewed if it is shown that he was never served in the case. That this is a principle of natural justice that no man is to be condemned unheard is undeniable. No authority is needed for this proposition. It is a self-evident one. True it is that Section 25B introduces an abbreviated procedure. It even takes away the elementary right of being heard full length in the conventional style hitherto followed. As the Supreme Court has said:— “The tenant is even deprived of the elementary right of a defendant to defend a proceeding brought against him, save on obtaining leave of the Rent Controller. If the leave is refused, by Section 25B (4) the statement made by the landlord in the application for eviction shall be deemed to be admitted by the tenant and the landlord is entitled to an order for eviction. No appeal or second appeal lies against that order. Section 25B (8) denies that right and provides instead for a revision to the High Court whose jurisdiction is limited to finding out whether the order complained of is according to law.” (Sarwan Singh v. Kasturi Lal, AIR 1977 SC 265 per Chandrachud, J.) 11. But the Legislature is careful to provide that the tenant must be served before an eviction order is passed on the basis of the deeming provision contained in Sub-section (4) of Section 25B. Sub-section (2) of Section 25B provides that the “Controller shall issue summons…”. Sub-section (3)(a) says:— “The Controller shall, in addition to, and simultaneously with, the issue of summons for service on the tenant, also direct summons for service on the tenant, also direct summons to be served by registered post, acknowledgement due…….”. 12. The Legislature has, therefore, laid down in Section 25B(3) that the Controller “shall also direct the summons to be served by registered post acknowledgement due” “In addition to, and simultane- ously with” the summons for service on the tenant in the ordinary manner. He may “also direct the Publication of the summons in the newspaper circulating in the locality” “if the circumstances of the case so require”. 13. Service by registered post is “in addition to and simultane- ously with” the ordinary manner of service. The two go together. They are identical in time. “In addition to and simultaneously with” are expressive words. So are the words “also and “shall” in S. 25(B) (3)(a). They embrace the idea of joining or uniting one thing to another, so as thereby to form one aggregate. The tenant must be “duly served (whether in the ordinary way or by registered post) in the form specified in the Third Schedule”, to use the words Sub-section (4) of Section 25B, before an order of eviction can be passed. These provisions regarding service have to be followed with meticulous care. The Con- troller must observe them scrupulously for they are the only safety valve 6 THE DELHI LAW TIMES 1979 in a “chain of stiff provisions”. Indeed the “door to defence” has been “narrowed down”. (See Busching Schmitz Pvt. Ltd. v. P.T. Menghani, (1977) 2 SCC 835). But a watchful Legislature has not dis- pensed with service, a basic requirement of fair play and fair trial. 14. Now what has happened in the instant case is this. The Additional Controller ordered summons to be issued “both ways—in the ordinary way and by registered post on as many as four occasions i.e. October 12, 1976, November 1, 1976. November 29, 1976 and Janu- ary 1, 1977 ”. Each time summons were issued in the ordinary way. But never by registered post. The landlady did not file the registered A.D. cover. So the Court could not issue summons by registered post. No registered A.D. cover is available on the record. On the ordinary summons the report was one of refusal but the Controller very properly did not accept it as sufficient service and he said so in the order dated July 16, 1977. Without issuing summons by registered post as is obli- gatory upon the Controller and is indicated by the crucial words viz. “shall in addition to and simultaneously with”, the Additional Cont- roller on January 10, 1977 at the “oral” request of the landlady’s counsel ordered publication of the summons in Jagat Weekly. The publication was done. The Additional Controller accepted this as suffi- cient service. Finding that no application for leave had been made within the time prescribed and that the “respondent is absent” as was noted in the proceedings of February 21, 1977, he passed an eviction order. 15. Counsel for the landlady contended that the eviction order passed in this case was not an ex parte order. He referred me to P.N. Films Ltd. v. Overseas Films Corporation Ltd., AIR 1958 Bom. 16. It cannot accept this argument. On a plain reading of Section 25B it cannot be said that the order passed against the absent tenant is any- thing other than an ex parte order. Sub-section (4) of Section 25B reads:— “………….In default of his appearance in pursuance of the summons or his obtaining such leave, the statement made by the landlord in the application for eviction shall be deemed to be admitted by the tenant and the applicant shall be entitled to an order for eviction on the ground aforesaid.\" 16. A failure to appear “in pursuance of the summons” is one thing. But where the tenant is not served with summons how he is expected to appear and defend it is difficult to understand. When he does not know about the case at all for he never received the summons and does not appear what shall we call it if not ex parte? It is not of great significance that the application to have the eviction order set aside ought to be an application for review to the Controller under S. 25B(9) of the Act and not under Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C. What is of capi- tal importance is this; whether there has been a valid service of summons, to use the language of the Act? (Section 25B(3)(b). 17. The question now is: Is it open to the Controller to bid adieu to service by registered post and resort straight to publication if service in the ordinary way has not been possible? My answer is No. VOL.XV SMT. KARMA WALI v. SHRI RAJINDER SINGH 7 On a proper construction of the section it appears to me that the Legislature is insistent on service by registered post. The word “shall” is a clear pointer. So important is this method of service in the sight of the Legislature that Section 25B(3(b) provides that where A.D. receipt purported to be signed by the tenant is received by the Controller of the registered article is received back with the postal endorsement that the tenant has refused to take delivery of the registered article, the Controller may declare that there has been ‘a valid service of summons”. Has there been “a valid service of summons”? This is now for the Additional Controller to decide. This question looms large on the horizon. The Rent Control Tribunal has ordered it to determine it after affording the parties an opportunity of evidence. 18. What is wrong with this order? It is said that it is with- out jurisdiction. Firstly, the question of jurisdiction was never raised before the Tribunal. No such objection was taken. Secondly, the justice of the case does not require that I should set aside that order. Substantial justice has been done. A Court of revision is not bound to inter- fere. Ramath Kelu Kurup v. Subramania Ayyar, AIR 1937 Mad. 654, and Bira v. Chaitan, AIR 1973 Orissa 132. I am not saying that the Tribunal has jurisdiction and that an appeal lies to it under Order 43 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On that question I have expressed my opinion in Rule K. Parikh’s case (supra). But even if the order of the Tribunal is illegal justice does not require that the land- lady, in the circumstances of this case, should now be heard to say that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction. She herself is responsible for the situation—a situation of some complexity, complicated as it have been by various proceedings. Firstly. she did not file the registered cover in spite of repeated orders of the Court. Secondly, she contended that the revision was not maintainable because an appeal lay. And thirdly she raised no objection to jurisdiction before the Tribunal as is apparent from the order itself. 19. Suppose I am wrong in my view and counsel for landlady is right in his submission, that there is no estoppel against statute and that jurisdiction cannot be created by estoppel. Even then the present appeal has to be dismissed on the short ground that it is not maintainable by reason of Sub-section (8) of Section 25B. Sub-section (8) reads:— “No appeal or second appeal shall lie against an order for the recovery of possession of any premises made by the Con troller in accordance with the procedure specified in this section: Provided that the High Court may, for the purpose of satisfying itself that an order made by the Controller under this section is according to law, call for the records of the case and pass such order in respect thereto as it thinks fit.” 20. A second appeal is expressly barred. Counsel said that I should treat this appeal as revision. I cannot do so. The proviso which gives the power of revision to the High Court postulates that the power is to be exercised in relation to an “order made by the Con- troller”. It is the order of the Controller which can been examined by this Court to see that it is “according to law”. If I convert the appeal 8 THE DELHI LAW TIMES 1979 into revision even then there will be the order of the Tribunal staring us in the face. And it is the Tribunal’s order of which the landlady complains. She is not aggrieved by the order of the Controller. That order is in her favour. 21. For these reasons I would hold that the appeal is incom- petent and I dismiss it as such. The Additional Controller will now decide the application of the tenant after giving the parties an opportu- nity to adduce evidence. The parties are, however, left to bear their own costs. P.N.C. Appeal dismissed. –––––––––––––––– 15 (1979) DELHI LAW TIMES 8 DELHI HIGH COURT Mr. Justice M.L. Jain JAIRAM GURNANI—Applicant versus SMT. SHANTA GURNANI—Respondent C.R. No. 657 of 1975––Decided on 12th Sept., 1978 (i) Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and Guar- dian and Wards Act, 1890, Code of Civil Procedure applies to proceedings under—Section 141, C.P.C. applicable. Held: That, that Section 141, C.P.C. clearly lay down that the pro- cedure provided by the Code at all be applied in all proceedings in a Court of Civil Jurisdiction. It is true that the Guardian and Wards Act, makes some provisions which are procedural in character, but in all other matters on which it is silent, the procedure provided in the Code, has to be followed. That clearly is the consequence of sections 4 and 141 of the Code. Hence Order 32, Rule 2, CPC applies to proceedings for appointment of Guardian and obtaining custody of the child. (Para 2) (ii) Code of Civil Procedure, Order 32, Rule 2—The Court can make inquiry of plaintiff serving or applying himself is minor or of unsound mind. Held: That the respondent in proceedings (for apportionment of guardian and custody of child) under the Hindu Minority and guardianship Act under the Guardian and wards can, where the petitioner suffers from unsoundness of mind or is a minor, insist that in order that the proceedings terminate me a binding result, they must be instituted and prosecuted by a next friend. The argument that it is only when a person purporting to act as a next friend or a guardian institu- tes or defends proceedings that a question whether he can do so can be allowed to be raised or inquired into, is wholly devoid of substance. (Para 3) (iii) Section 115, C.P.C.—Revision from order holding inquiry under Order 32, Rule 2, if maintainable.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
