Based on those facts, the courts below held that the Trust having once allotted the plots and having collected part of the a consideration, it could not have cancelled the allotments, probably basing the respondents' case on the principle of promissory estoppel. Here the courts below have failed to notice the legal principle that there is no estoppel against law. The allotment of plots by the Trust is controlled by the statutory rules. Any allotment contrary to those rules will be against the law. Since the allotments made in favour of some of the respondents was based on wrong b application of the reservation made for \"local displaced person\" those allotments were contrary to law. Hence, the principle of promissory/equitable estoppel cannot be invoked to protect such illegal allotments. In the said view of the matter, we are unable to sustain the judgments and decrees impugned in these appeals. 14. However, we were told at the Bar that the amount deposited by some C vl the respondents/allottees is still with the Trust. If so, they are entitled to get back those deposits without driving them to other legal proceedings. We direct the Trust to refund all such amounts deposited pursuant to the allotments in question made in favour of such of those respondents herein, with 12 per cent interest per annum from the date of deposit till the date of d payment. 15.

But the Superintending Engineer was alleged to have obstructed the progress of the work with the result that the work could not be completed within the time schedule. The contract executed between the parties was rescinded by the respondents on the ground that the appellant had not completed even 10 per cent of the work despite lapse of more than 9 months. The appellant, however, contended that the termination of the contract was in breach thereof. He claimed Rs 20,000 as damages for breach of contract besides claiming other amounts payable by the respondent to him. Suit for the recovery of Rs 32,000 filed by the appellant was decreed with a direction that the appellant would also be entitled to future interest @ 6 per cent per annum. After the decree of the trial court the appellant filed an application under Section 152 of the CPC praying for awarding of interest from the date of the suit till the date of the decree by correcting the judgment and decree on the ground that non-awarding of interest pendente lite was an accidental omission. The trial court allowed this application and directed the correction of the judgment and decree by awarding interest pendente lite. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree of the trial court, the respondent-State filed first appeal and against the order passed in application under Section 152 a revision application. The High Court, vide the order impugned herein, partly allowed the appeal by holding the respondent-State liable to pay only a sum of Rs 4783.33 to the plaintiff with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum. The civil revision was allowed and the order of the trial court granting interest pendente lite was set aside. In appeal before the Supreme Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the order of the trial court by which he was granted interest pendente lite. It was submitted that non- granting of the interest for the period of litigation was an accidental omission which was rectified by the trial court. Partly allowing the appeal Held: The exercise of power under Section 152, CPC contemplates the correction of mistakes by the court of its ministerial actions and does not contemplate passing of effective judicial orders after the judgment, decree or order. After the passing of the judgment, decree or order, the court or the tribunal becomes functus officio and thus being not entitled to vary the terms of the judgments, decrees and orders earlier passed. The corrections contemplated are correcting of only accidental omissions or mistakes and not all omissions and mistakes which might have been committed by the court while passing the judgment, decree or order. The omission sought to be corrected which goes to the merits of the case is beyond the scope of Section 152 for which the proper remedy for the aggrieved party is to file an appeal or a review application. It implies that the section cannot be pressed into service to correct an omission which is intentional, however erroneous that may be. (Para 6) It has been noticed that the courts below have been liberally construing and applying the provisions of Sections 151 and 152 of the CPC even after passing of effective orders in the lis pending before them. No court can, under the cover of the aforesaid sections, modify, alter or add to the terms of its ori3inal judgment, decree or order. In the instant case, the trial court had specifically held the respondent-State liable to pay future interest only despite the prayer of the appellant for grant of interest with effect from the date of alleged breach which impliedly meant that the Court had rejected the claim of the appellant insofar as pendente lite interest was concerned. The omission in not granting the pendente lite interest could not be held to be accidental omission or mistake as was wrongly done by the trial court.

Section 152 CPC provides for correction of clerical or arithmetical mistakes in judgments, decrees or orders of errors arising therein from any accidental slip or omission. The exercise of this power contemplates the a correction of mistakes by the court of its ministerial actions and does not contemplate of passing effective judicial orders after the judgment, decree or order. The settled position of law is that after the passing of the judgment, decree or order, the court or the tribunal becomes functus officio and thus being not entitled to vary the terms of the judgments, decrees and orders earlier passed. The corrections contemplated are of correcting only b accidental omissions or mistakes and not all omissions and mistakes which might have been committed by the court while passing the judgment, decree or order. The omission sought to be corrected which goes to the merits of the case is beyond the scope of Section 152 for which the proper remedy for the aggrieved party is to file appeal or review application. It implies that the section cannot be pressed into service to correct an omission which is c intentional, however erroneous that may be. It has been noticed that the courts below have been liberally construing and applying the provisions of Sections 151 and 152 of the CPC even after passing of effective orders in the lis pending before them. No court can, under the cover of the aforesaid sections, modify, alter or add to the terms of its original judgment, decree or d order. In the instant case, the trial court had specifically held the respondent- State liable to pay future interest only despite the prayer of the appellant for grant of interest with effect from the date of alleged breach which impliedly meant that the Court had rejected the claim of the appellant insofar as pendente lite interest was concerned. The omission in not granting the pendente lite interest could not be held to be accidental omission or mistake e as was wrongly done by the trial court vide order dated 30-11-1973. The High Court was, therefore, justified in setting aside the aforesaid order by accepting the revision petition filed by the State. 7. The reliance of the learned counsel for the appellant on Jainab Bai ease 1 is misplaced inasmuch as in that case the aggrieved party had sought for award of interest after the decree by filing the application under Section 152 CPC and under Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC. The Division Bench relied upon the decision of the Madras High Court in Thirugnanavalli Ammal v. P Venugopala Pillai5 wherein it was held that where a mistake had occurred in the decree in spite of mention of the future interest in the judgment, the Court had the power to rectify the mistake and if it occurred in the decree because of omission of it in the judgment, the mistake could not be corrected. We agree with the view taken by the Madras High Court but cannot subscribe to the general observations made by the Madhya Bharat High Court in Jainab Bai ease 1. In Maharaj Puttu Lal v.

(Sethi, J.) 505 pleader was admitted to have made an oral statement requesting the Court to determine the amount of mesne profits in the execution department which a was accepted but not mentioned in the decree sheet. Under the facts and circumstances of that case the Court held that such being an accidental omission the same could be corrected in exercise of the powers vested in the Court under Section 152 of the CPC. b C 8. In Firozshaw case2 future interest was allowed by the Court on being satisfied that the omission in the decree was accidental and that no grounds existed for the defendant therein to resist the claim of the decree-holder. The WB. Financial Corpn. case4 does not in any way help the appellant inasmuch as in that case the scope of Section 152 was not at all considered as the only point decided was that a plaintiff is entitled as of right to the grant of interest under Section 34 of the CPC. In view of what we have held in this case regarding the ambit and scope of Section 152 of the CPC, we are of the opinion that the view of the Ma:dhya Bharat High Court cannot be held to be based upon sound principles. 9. The claim of the petitioner for payment of Rs 20,000 as damages on account of breach of contract committed by the respondent-State was disallowed by the High Court as the appellant was found to have not placed d the material on record to show that he had actually suffered any loss on account of the breach of contract. In this regard, the appellate court observed: e f g h \"It is not his case that for due compliance of the contract he had advanced money to the labourers or that he had purchased materials or that he had incurred any obligations and on account of breach of contract by the defendants he had to suffer loss on the above and other heads. Even in regard to the percentage of profit he did not place any material on record but relied upon assessment of the profits by the Income Tax Officer while assessing the income of the contractors from building contracts.\" Such a finding of the appellate court appears to be based on wrong assumptions. The appellant had never claimed Rs 20,000 on account of alleged actual loss suffered by him. He had preferred his claim on the ground that had he carried out the contract, he would have earned profit of 10% on Rs 2 lakhs which was the value of the contract. This Court in AT. Brij Paul Singh v. State of Gujara~ while interpreting the provisions of Section 73 of the Contract Act, 1872 has held that damages can be claimed by a contractor where the Government is proved to have committed breach by improperly rescinding the contract and for estimating the amount of damages, the court should make a broad evaluation instead of going into minute details. It was specifically hel9 that where in the works contract, the party entrusting the work committed breach of contract, the contractor is entitled to claim the 6 (1984) 4 sec 59 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Claim of expected profits is legally admissible on proof of the breach of contract by the erring party. It was observed: (SCC pp. 64-65, a paras 10-11) \"What would be the measure of profit would depend upon facts and circumstances of each case. But that there shall be a reasonable expectation of profit is implicit in a works contract and its loss has to be compensated by way of damages if the other party to the contract is guilty of breach of contract cannot be gainsaid. In this case we have the b additional reason for rejecting the contention that for the same type of work, the work site being in the vicinity of each other and for identical type of work between the same parties, a Division Bench of the same High Court has accepted 15 per cent of the value of the balance of the works contract would not be an unreasonable measure of damages for c loss of profit. * * * Now if it is well established that the respondent was guilty of breach of contract inasmuch as the rescission of contract by the respondent is held to be unjustified, and the plaintiff-contractor had executed a part of the works contract, the contractor would be entitled to damages by way d of loss of profit. Adopting the measure accepted by the High Court in the facts and circumstances of the case between the same parties and for the same type of work at 15 per cent of the value of the remaining parts of the works contract, the damages for loss of profit can be measured.\" To the same effect is the judgment in Mohd. Salamatullah v. Govt. of A.P.1 e After approving the grant of damages in case of breach of contract, the Court further held that the appellate court was not justified in interfering with the finding of fact given by the trial court regarding quantification of the damages even if it was based upon guesswork. In both the cases referred to hereinabove, 15% of the contract price was granted as damages to the contractor. In the instant case however, the trial court had granted only 10% f of the contract price which we feel was reasonable and permissible, particularly when the High Court had concurred with the finding of the trial court regarding breach of contract by specifically holding that \"we, therefore, see no reason to interfere with the finding recorded by the trial court that the defendants by rescinding the agreement committed breach of contract\". It follows, therefore, as and when the breach of contract is held to g have been proved being contrary to law and terms of the agreement, the erring party is legally bound to compensate the other party to the agreement. The appellate court was, therefore, not justified in disallowing the claim of the appellant for Rs 20,000 on account of damages as expected profit out of the contract which was found to have been illegally rescinded. h 7 (1977) 3 sec 590: AIR 1977 SC 1481 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Sometimes it happens, either because the stain is too insufficient or due to haematological changes and plasmatic coagulation that a serologist might fail to detect the origin of the blood. Will it then mean that the blood would be of some other origin? Such guesswork that blood on the other axe would have been animal blood is unrealistic and far-fetched in the broad spectrum of this case. The effort of the criminal court should not be to prowl for imaginative doubts. Unless the doubt is of a reasonable dimension which a judicially conscientious mind entertains with some objectivity, no benefit can be claimed by the accused. (Para 25) It cannot be said that in all cases where there was failure of detecting the origin of the blood, the circumstance arising from recovery of the weapon would stand relegated to disutility.
