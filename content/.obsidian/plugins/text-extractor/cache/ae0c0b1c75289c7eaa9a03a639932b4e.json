In brief, while the appellant may be allowed to deposit the amount due under the agreement, viz., Rs . 3,45,000 tog~her with interest at 11 per cent from April, 1967 up to date, the mortgage decree in her favour must be extinguished, save to the extent of the cash then paid . The High Court expressed a slightly drastic though similar view, somewhat loosely, thus : After we have expressed our opinion and dictated this order, the learned Counsel for the plaintiff orally requests us to permit the plaintiff to deposit the entire amount as directed by the learned trial Judge in the Court . Having regard to the fact that no such stand was taken at any earlier stage and this request has been orally made only after we have dictated this order, we do not see any justification whatever for complying with this request. We may also point out that there is no actual undertaking given by the plaintiff herself that even if we give such an opportunity to the plaintiff to deposit the suni of Rs. 3,45,000 into this Court now, she will give up her right under the mortgage decree, which she has obtained against the defendant in the present suit in O.S. No. 154 of 1968. (emphasis added) 6. We agree with the substance of this direction, but without going that far pass a conditional decree. We should have taken long pages and elaborate argument in substantiation of the course we adopt, but for reasons adduced at the very beginning, we decline to do so. We gather that in many jurisdictions the highest court, which hears the arguments at enormous length and has the advantage of a complete statement of facts and discussion of law in the judgment under appeal, limits itself to a severe economy of words in the statement of its reasoning. We regard this as a wholesome step. Natural justice necessitates full hearing, not a flood of words of forbidding length. 7. We direct that a decree be passed that the plaintiff-appellant do deposit within six months from today the entire. sum of Rs. 3,45,000 together with interest due up to date at the rate of 11 per cent, together with an undertaking that she would give up all her rights under the mortgage decree passed in her favour in O.S. No . 154 of 1968, except to the extent of the amount actually paid to the South Indian Bank for taking the assignment. If these two conditions are fulfilled, the appeal will stand allowed and a final decree for specific performance passed. In the event of non-compliance with either of these conditions the appeal will stand dismissed with costs. (1980) I Supreme Court C..e• 634 (BEFORE Y. V. CHANDRAOHUD, c. J. AND v. R. KRISHNA IYER, N.

The first appointment in the Survey is made in the grade of Deputy Superintending Surveyor (D .S. S.) in Class I. In view of functional necessity, Rule 11 of the 1950 Rules provided that 50% posts were to be filled by the army engineers, 25% by the directly recruited civilian engineers and 25% by civilian proraotees from class II. [By 1965 amendment promotees were to enter class I at S. S. level. So at the D.S. S. level the ratio of Army recruits to civilian rel-ruits was 2 : l.] Rule 2 enjoined an army officer to possess 3 to 6 years' commissioned service at the time of his recruitment in the Survey. He maintains his military nexus, wears military uniform while in the civil employ- ment (Rule 8) and would be considered for the military promotions (Rule 9) and get equivalent rise in th e army (Rule 10). Rule 5 provides that the seniority of military officers vis-a-vis directly recruited civilian officers would be determined by the year of allotment which would depend in the case of military officers, on the date of their first commission in the army including antedate jf any and in the case of directly recruited civilian officers on the date of appoint- ment antedated by two years . Among those allotted to the same year, military officers would rank senior to directly recruited civilian officers. Under Rule 5-A a qualifying two year probation and a further three years service are a sine qua non for substantive promotion. Thus by virtue of Rules 2, 5, 5-A and 11, the military engineers were in more preferential position than the civilian engineers in the matters of initial 1ecruitment as well as seniority and promotion. Aggrieved th e respondents (ci\\.ilian officers) filed a writ petition in the High Court which was allowed. Therefore, appeals by certificate under Article 133 were filed by army officers (appellants) before the Suprem e Court.

The emphasis is not on the administrative pigeonbole in which the Survey is placed for secretariat or budgetary purposes, nor on its lineage , nor, indeed on the label 'civil' or 'Defence' but on the nature of its duties and the relevant pattern of manpower and, most importantly, the concrete conditions of recruitment and principal career requirements while in service, having regard to the strategic essence of the goals the service must subserve. So viewed, the Survey of India is army-oriented. It must be geared to the goal of national security if it is to justify itself in a large country of extensive mountain frontiers, border disputes, hi<..tory of hot war, interior defence lines and military routes. (Paras 16 and 17) The 2 : 1 ratio in favour of the army personnel at the D.S. S. level is justified by the fact that the military portion of the survey is a compelling factor for national defenc e, in peace and in war. It is fairly intelligible and basically equitable to allow military engineers credit for commissioned service and protection of already earned higher salaries. (Paras 42 to 44 and 54) (1) If the induction of the army engineers has a nexus with the raison d'etre of the Survey of India, the exact dosage needed to be ,drawn from the source for functional adequacy is not susceptible of judicial measurement. The administration has a reach of materials and range of expertise so that courts must keep out, save wher e irrational criteria, irrelevant factors, mala fide motives or gross folly enter the verdict. But here 50% of Class I services, from a historical need-based or other approach, cannot be called irrational, imp ertinent or improvident. (Paras 54 and 55) Likewise, the award of the length of commissioned services in the army as service in the Survey of India cannot be dismissed as arbitrary or irrelevant. The necessity to attract such officers is a factor. The reality of their engineer- ing experience on commission cannot be wished away. The value of such experience for the Survey of India with defence commitments argues itself. Whether such services should be given credit wholly or at all in the new service is more a matter of pragmatic wisdom beyond the bounds of irrationality, arbitrary fancy or departmental quasi-nepotism. It is difficult to dislodge the rules, fixing the quota and grafting of service while on Army Commission onto the Survey of India service, a-; favoured tr eatment devoid of rational foundation . (Para 56) (2) It ii, trite law that equals shall be treated as equals and, in its appli- cation to public services, thi<. simply means that once several persons have become members of one sel\"'/1ce they stand as equals and cannot, thereafter, be invidiously differentiated tor purposes of salary , seniority, promotion or otherwise, based on the source of recruitment or other adventitious factor. The basic assumption for the application of this principle is that the various members or groups of recruit~ have fused into or integrated as one common service . (Para 45) But uncquals cannot he forced into equality. The military engineers are unequal because their 3 to 6 years of commissioned service cannot be wish ed away when brought into the service shoulder to shoulder with raw rec1 uits. Secondly , their salaries arc higher and that should not be forfeited as punishment for entering the Survey Service. Their commissioned service and personal pay are prot ected - a just gesture without which many army engineers may not care to respond and the 'efficiency' factor of the Survey Service will fail in their absence.

BALASUBRAMANYAM (Krishna 1,,,, J.) 637 As noted above, a 1..ommon pool where the plurality meets is a necessary postulate for the application of the equalist mandate. In the present case the army engineers remain in 'uniform' as it were but wear a Survey of India overcoat. They do not merge or fuse into a single integrated service with the civilian recruits but remain a1., an immiscible layer of the Class I Service, the other layer heing the civilians . The two wings remain close but separate, not one homogenised family. This is a unique pattern where the army members remain with one foot in the army and the other in the Survey of India .

The :onstitutional missiles used, with success. in the encounter in the High Court by the 'civilians' to shoot down the 'military men's' preferential claims under the relevant service rules, are Articles 14 and 16. And here, in this Court, the Army Wing is fighting back to repulse the civilian wing by defusing the war-head of these two fundamental rights. Military imagery vivifies the litigative havoc when sectors of our public services go to battle against each other , though there is so much else to wage war against in the service of the people. 2. A narration of facts falling within a short compass will unfold the real issue, revolving round the salary, seniority and de facto promotional dis- parity inter se, which has sparked off the forensic war. The Union of India, one of the appellants, supports the stand of the military sector of the Survey Service, if we may so designate it. A survey of the story of this conflict suggests the sombre thought that unending litigation, affecting the public services with inevitable impact on morale and efficiency, is becoming an epidemic in courts even among strategic cadres and sensitive sectors - a matter almost for consternation which surely must kindle a search for constitutional alternatives for resolution of service questions without large numbers of civil servants being locked in long-drawn-out legal struggles. Does the experience of 30 years under the Constitution indicate that, save where fundamental constitutional issues arise, Whitley Councils, Service Tribunals and other specialised adjudi- catory agencies, with the imprimatur of finality, are a more pragmatic mechanism of Service Justice? 3. The factual setting, sufficient to unravel the constitutional contention, may now be delineated. Both the appeals against the judgment of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh cover the same subject-matter, although one of them is by the Central Government and the other by the members of the Survey of India from among the Defence personne1, and both have been resisted on th e same basis by the civilian recruits to the Service . A common judgment will dispose of both the cases but we must begjn from the very beginning to get a hang of the controversy. 4. The genesis of the Survey of India, its life before birth, its genetic composition and hereditary characteristics, mould the structural engineering of the Service and, therefore, have a bearing on the issues debated before us by both sides . While the High Court has, to some extent, slurred over th~ chronicle, both sides have heavily stressed before us the saga of the Survey of India , each to lend strength to its point of view. So, a peep into the bicentennial biography of the Survey of India is a necessary exercise as a starting point. To blink at history is to lose the living link with the Past and to stumble in the Present. Yet strangely , none such, i.e . history of the Service , to serve as a lucid background is given in their statement by either party, save incidentally . Unfortunately, the fine and fruitful art of present- ing a luscent written brief is still in the long Indian Year of the Infant and we have to cun out and piece together materials which should have been set ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

And instalments of additional infonnation during the progress of the hearing has had to make do for a comprehensive unfoldment. Better late than never! S. The story of the Survey of India has been narrated in its brief auto- biography. 'Our Department', produced on the eve of its bicentennial in 1967. This department was born during the days of Lord Clive under happy army stars, had a military upbringing and, in its brilliant career, achieved lustrous exploits . Starting from an accident of history - the request of a historian, Robert Orme , to an East India Company administrator , Lord Clive, for a map of Bengal - the Survey of India sprang to life in embryonic form when Major Rennet was appointed to execute this survey and, thereafter, was cradled by the army but spread out to become a dynamic department and developmental instrument in the decades ahead. In war and in peace, in building the nation and defending its security, in 'civilian' ventures and military operations the Survey of India has become a National Service in the role of adviser on survey data and kindred adventures . Indeed, almost all ministries of th e Central Government and many States have used the services of the Survey of India during the several Five-Year Plans. 'Look before you leap becomes in development terms, survey before you start, and so it is that in 1967 this great department of strategic importance is able to write its story and conclude : 25. In short. in its ever increasing sphere of vast, diverse and widely scattered work, Survey of India has built up a unique reputa- tion both within the country and outside as a sound, distinguished, and great Survey Organisation of the World , progressively marching forward, expanding, adapting and modernising itself and continuing its contri- butions to science. security and development.

During British days, it was not an accident that the Survey of India was under the army. It was an inalienable companion of conquest and con- solidation of defence and development - a versatile genius which may be put to greater good in the era of Freeqom and After: 12. It is perhaps not so well known that the work of the Survey of India has special significance iri matters of country's defence. The Survey of India has to organise surveys and work well ahead to provide maps at the right time and of the right places where campaigns might be fought in war . fhe Chinese thr eat along the northern borders of the country since 1959 necessitated diverting immediately a very large pot ential of the Deparlment to carry out the work of special topographical surveys for defence purposes in one of the most inhospitable and rugged terrains of the world - an assignm ent which cost the Department many precious lives and many years of hard work . The bulk of military survey and mapping requirements are met by Survey of India. Though the military survey service exists, it is small and has insufficient personnel, who carry out limited technical work and such staff duties as army requires in peace-time. 13. There have, thus, been many occasions for the Survey of India to be commended for its work for defence and development in war and peace, and for providing the basic knowledge of the land for all its usen.. 1 8. The Surveyor General, for reasons of functional importance, is also the Director of Military Survey. Topographical Mapping states : When corrections and additions to maps of military importance are suggested by the Director, Military Survey, they should, as a general rule, be accepted by the Survey of India. It is necessary to notice the role of the Survey Department under the Director of Military Survey who is also the Surveyor General thus bringing out the interlacing of activity . Obviously , there is not merely sensitivity and con- fidentiality but also a high degree of skill which cannot be relaxed and an instant sense of discipline, which cannot be liberalised, in view of the fact that military operations of nat ional significance depend, in part, on the Sun·ey of India and its service. While it is fair to emphasise that considerable peace- time developmental 'work is rendered by this D epartment, its adventurous spirit of climbing mountains, penetrating wildemesses and entering into forbidden regions cannot be minimis ed. Lt Col. San des writing on 'The Military Engin eer in India' states : History has shown that there is something in the training which the Survey of India imparts to its officers which makes them peculiarly valuable in war.

In many circles, Directors of the Survey of India have been Office Advisers to the 'Commander-in-Chief' and the work done by this Department has had in many cases military meaning. This was reflected in the past in the officer situation and personnel complexion. Class I Officers were a]) military men while Class IT men were civilian graduates. Brig. Wheeler , writing of the officer situation in British India, summed up thus : Perhaps the greatest <;ingle factor affecting military organisation was that whereas there were nearly 60 militarv officers in 1925, there were only 30 in 1939 ; to train a civilian to be sound and efficient soldier takes a considerable time : to train a non-survey soldier to become an efficient surveyor, much longer, very much longer. The military commitments of the Survey of India in the World War TI made it a <.;trategic instrument invisible to the lay but invaluable tc, the esoteric. 12. We have pressed this part of the career of the Survey of India to knock out the impression that its military component i_s purely a concession to the historical staffing pattern and the lack of avenues for promotion to Armv Engineers. It is an in-built necessity of the Department in national intere<;t. We agreei with counsel for the respondents, Sri Govindan Nair, that the earlv history of the Survev of India as a child of the army cannot become an obsession to distort or debunk the enormity of its purely develop- mental undertakings. It is a Civil Service which serves in national reconstruction all the time, but, at the ca 1l of the country. is ready to switch to defence, ri-:k anywhere and do surveys as commanded. We must set our sights right ahout the civil and military range of the versatile department and not swallow the brash version that it is all 'brass'.

No. Most of its work is peace- time activity of a fundamental, though invisible character to promote develop- ment in its multitude and magnitude and, indeed, in its panoramic magnificence. 13. But we cannot get away from the historic fact - not merely the fact of history - that the Survey of India is, first and foremost, an instrument of military c;trategy for the defence of the country although its talents are 5.

Let us thus place accent on what is essential but not miss what exists as a reality. From this angle, a 1ega1 raconteur may retell the story slightly differently . 1S. The army in British India had, as one of its strategic operations, to undertake the survey of the interior and frontier of the country and had , therefore , under it a department wholly manned by military personnel. After independence and the enactment of the Constitution, this military limb separated from the Defence Forces. wa-, constituted into a Civil Service with the Surveyor General at the apex and a hierarchy below of triple components together making up the Clas,; I service The Service, in its new dimensions, was manned by civilian and military personnel due to functional imperatives. The entry into the Service wa<; at the point of Depntv Superintending Surveyors, save for a category of promotees from Class II, with provision for spiralling up to higher positions . The posts were fil1ed accordinr to Rules framed under the proviso to Article 309 on a .:'iO : .:'iO basis, as between army engineering personnel dovetailt>d into the Survev of India and civilian-, recruited or promoted or otherwise appointed . 16.

Not merely because of heredity but markedly because of the nation's potential demands and perennial expectations from this specialised Service, not merely in emergency but to be always on the qui vi~e. We gather from the affidavit of the Senior Director, on behalf of the Union of India, that the army component is an inalienable requirement of the Survey of India if it is to fulfil its role. He swears : Some of the reasons for Corps of Engineers being one of the sources of recruitment are as follows : (a) Survey of India may need mobilisation in the event of any emergency or war . (b) The Corps of Engineer Officers in Survey of India form the nucleus around which mobilisation can take place quickly. (c) The small element in the Army cannot cater for training and experience, and hence Corps of Engineer Officers are kept in Survey of India which provides the ideal ground for training and experience of these officers during peace so as to keep them fully competent technically in the event of a war or emergency In order to maintain an adequate balance between military and civilian officers, and to attract the higher type of Corps of Engineer Officers to the Survey of India, 50% of the total number of posts in the Class I Cadre were earmarked for the Corps of Engineer Officers. 17. What, then, is the raison d'etre of this Department? War means advance into or withdrawal from territory. Operations involve identification of topography, climatology, environmentology, location of defence positions, marking of marching and retreating positions and artillery targets and paratroop landing positions, keeping secret strategic ' centres and sealing them off as out of bounds - and a host of other' survey s' invaluably informational and immediately available for national defence . It is obvious that if this be the functional relevance of the Survey of India, some divisions of it have to be fighting fit, always on the alert , ready to rush to the risk zones and technically capable of teaming with the ground forces in seasons of emergency and occasions of external aggression, before and after . The Survey of India must be geared to the goal of national security if it is to justify itself in a large country of extensive mountain ' frontiers, border disputes , history of hot war, interior defence lines and military routes. Of course, our imperial masters could afford , at the expense of people's welfare, to keep such a department as a section of the Armed Forces, idle for long stretches of time but keeping their tools sharp for eventualities. Free India could not. Naturally, the country's leaders. entrusted with gubernatorial responsibilities in this behalf , hit upon a golden mean of forming a separate Survey of India , no more a wing of army. The object was understandable . A permanent yet considerable number of technical personnel virtually idle during peace-time was a luxury. Nevertheless, an instrument was forged which preserved the military mood of active duty but expanded and expended its sophisticated expertise during years of peace on national needs of other Ministries or States' requirements . It reflected the duo~ dexterous roles and mosaic of manpower in its recruitment policy.

We see nothing to interpret the happened in the 18. The Senior Director with reference to current conditions, deposes as affiant of the Central Government : Reasons for seniority and pay protection for tb.e Corps of Engineei Officers are as follows : (a) They suffer due to lack of higher opportunities of promotion to Brig., Major General, Lt. General and General by their volunteer- ing for the Survey of India. (b) They can utmost expect to get military pension. as a Colonel but not as Brig. and higher which are substantially higher. (c) They lose other perquisites like house rent, concessional electricity and furniture facilities, concessional Form 'D' facilities, and many other conc.essions. Unless, therefore, they are given protection of seniority and pay in order to partly compensate their losses no Corps of Engineer Officer would ever volunteer for the Survey of India. These were the con- siderations for the seniority and pay protection for Corps of Engineer Offic.ers. Even if, for argument's sake, it is admitted that preferential treat- ment is given to Corps of Engineer Officers (which it is not), it is done under the rules which have been framed based on the differenc.es between the various sourc.es of recruitment, and the said differences have a reasonable relation to the nature of the offic.e to which recruit- ment is made. Thus, the appointment, and terms and conditions of the Corps of Engineer Offic.ers can legitimately be substantiated on the basis of valid classification . 19. At this point we must eye at close quarters the Survey of India (Recruitment from Corps of Engineer Offic.ers) Rules, 1950. Primarily, it relates to the recruitment from the Corps of Engineer Officers. The relevant part of Rule 2 runs thus : 2. Recruitment : A Corps of Engineer Officer for appointment to the Survey of India should at the time of appointment normally have not less than three and not more than six years' CQmmissioned service, but this rule may be relaxed in exc.eptional cases. Corps of Engineer Officers shall apply for appointment to the Survey of India to the Military Secretary, through the Engineer-in-Chief, who will transmit the applications to the Surveyor General. The Surveyor General will maintain a list of such applicants, as, after making the due enquiries, he considers to be suitable for appointment. When a military post falls vacant and the Military quota has not been filled the Surveyor General shall -nominate an officer or officers from the above list. 20.

From promoted Class II Civilian Officers 3. From direct recruits by competitive examination through 50% 25% the U .

S.) position in the Service from where they rise on promotion as Supenntending Surveyors (hereinafter referred to as SS), Deputy Director and Director, the top post being of Surveyor General . These pro- motion posts are available for all the categories of entrants as has been clarified in the later set of rules called 'The Survey of India (Class l Recruitment) Rules, 1960 '. 21. Before we part with the 1950 Rules, it is necessary to place accent on some aspects of the nuhtary officers and their career in the Survey of India. Their sojourn in this new Department is not an exit trom the army but a long furlough, as it were. For all practical purposes, they retain their military position and remain under military control and are liable to be called back for regular army service . lt is a k.rnd of provisional adoption into a different family but with the ties in the natural family kept intact. 22. A Corps of Eng ineer Officer will be qualified for recruitment only if he is in commissioned service for between three and six years. Then he is to go through a two-year per iod of probation during which he is to pass tests. If he is not good, he gets back to military duty and even if he makes good, he has an option to revert to mtlitary employment . Even after con- firmation, the officer may revert during the first 20 years of commissioned service on his own request. Ev en ther eafter , with the approval ·of the. govern- ment, he mijy revert permanently to military duty , save in the case of those who fall under Rule 4(c) . If an officer retires from th e army that will involve retirement from the Survey of India too, save in the case of those who are Colonels or Lt . Colonels, covered by Rule 4(c) and retire from the army only for the reason that they have attained the requisite age limit. Such persons under Rule 4(c) may continue in the Survey of India until the age of super- annuation from civil employment. It is important to note that an officer may be reverted permanently to military duty if he is no longer needed in the Survey of India on account of reduction in strength or unsatisfactory work. He may also be reverted temporarily to military duty for grounds given in Rule 4(f}. 23. Another remarkable rule is Rule 8 which speaks of wearing military uniform while in civil employment if the incumbent is willing to observe the courtesies due to military officers of superior ranks. Rule 9 is extremely significant and reads thus : 9.

Ruic I O is abo meaningful because the army officers in the Survey of India when they rise to higher positions get equivalent rise in the army. There are a few more aspects which perhaps may complete the story but the thrust of the submissions made by the learned Attorney General on the strength of these rules is that the Army Engineers are not integrated with or incorporated into the Survey of India Class I Service in toto. There is a partial assimilation but a substantial separation persists. Once an Army Engineer, always an Army Engineer , is the gist. Absent integration, Article 14 is out of bounds - such is the cumulative effect of the Service Rules , 1950 according to the learned Attorney General. We will presently examine his claim which has been rejected by the High Court. 2S. Indeed, the pivotal point of this ca~e is perhaps the nature of the Service with special reference' to Articles 14 and 16, viz., the integration of the two sources into a common pool and the impermissible de facto bifurcation of the two strands in promotional streams in the years ahead. Also, the myth of Defence needs and consequent preference for military recruits. The High Court rightly formulated the crucial question , when it stated : Thus, the bone of contention of the respondents is that the very nature of the work undertaken and done by the Survey of India is related to Defence purposes and the officers recruited from the army engineering corps are specially trained for this purpose. This, accord- ing to the respondents , is the reasonable connection between the classifi- cation and the object that is sought to be served in recruitment to Cla:-s I service of th e Survey of India. 26.

In the original counter-affidavits filed by respondents, the stand taken is that because the rules provide for special privileges, they are being given to the army personnel and so the equality concept is not violated. That is really begging the question. When the petitioners complain that the rules made in this behalf violate the equality concept as enunciated in Articles 14 and 16, it would be futile to reply to that argument by saying that the rules so provide. In the later affidavits some attempt is sought to be made to point out that the nature of the work carried on by the Survey of India department is essentially connected with the defence of India and that the officers recruited from the Anny Corps of Engineers are specially trained for this purpose. On the basis of the material placed before us, we are not inclined to accept that the work done by th& Survey of India department is essentially of the nature and character required for defence purposes. It may be that along with several other surveys carried on by this Department, it does survey work which is useful to the Defence department. From the affidavits and the other material placed before us, it could be seen that the survey work done by the Department 1s mostly concerned with the development projects and preparation of maps for various Ministries, State Governments, public sector projects and otht:r civilian agencies. The annexure filed along with the additional reply affidavit filed by the petitioners shows that the Survey of India is a national survey organisation. It appears to have surveyed quite a large number of development projects during the three plan periods. The department might have prepared some maps useful for the defence purposes. But that is only part of the work and incidental to the nature of the survey it carries on. Its work does not appear to be defence oriented. The survey done by the department is utilised by several departments of the Central and State Governments, public sector projects and other civilian agencies. It is, therefore, making a tall claim to say that the survey is essentially of defence nature. Further, there is nothing to show that even if the work related to defence purpose~ the civilian officers are not employed or engaged. Thus, the Survey of India appears to be a civilian department with a civilian budget. Further, whenever there is an emergency there is nothing which prevents or bars the Government of India from calling upon the civilian officer:; also to serve on the border. It is the stand of the petitioners that if 25 army personnel belonging to the Survey of India were called to the border area in 1962 war, as many as 70 civilian officers belonging to Class I and Class II categories were called to work in the same area . They also assert that just like the Defence department l,ses some maps prepared by the Survey of India, the Forest department, G.S.I., P.W.D., etc. , also use the maps. So we are not inclined to hold that the nature of the survey and work carried on by the Survey of India department is largely defence oriented. 27. Even at this stage, we may refer to the High Court's view about the historical background of this Service : It is, further. stated by the respondents that the historical back- ground also supporh recruitment of as much as 50% of Class I officers._ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

This argument overlooks the fact that we are concerned with the situation as it obtains in Independent India and not in British India. It is true that some attempts have been made after attainment of independence to attract officers from lhe Army Engineering Corps into Survey of India department. But as m 1950, 1960, 1962 and 1974 Rules generally show, the work done hy the department is essentially civilian in character. The impugned rules will have to he examined in the light of the circumstances that dre now prevailing ever since independence and not on the so-called historical background which has, in any case, become archaic. In regard to the special training given to the army personnel which Ls said to justify the classification, it appears to us that this claim is not tenable. If the anny personnel are given training in field engineer- mg for 9 months and for 3 years in the Military Engineering College, Kirki, the qualifications required for direct recruitment of civilians are no less valuable. Largely, only engineering graduates are recruited directly. fhey have equal engineering experience. Further, it does not appear that the army officers had been given any survey training when they were in the army service. ft is not, therefore, possible to say that the recruits from the army are better qualified than the civilian direct recruits. The promotees from Class II have, behind them, a very long experience of not less than one decade in the work undertaken by the Survey of India department. With this long experience of survq work, particularly belonging to this department behind them, we do not ~ec any justification for their being discriminated against in favour of army officers. We are not, therefore, prepared to accept that the army personnel in the Survey of India department have had any longer or better trainmg required for Survey of India than either the direct recruib or promotees from Class II service to Class I service. The latter two categories appear to be as qualified and as experienced as the army officers to carry out the work of Survey of India. The only conclusion that is possible from the above discussion is that this classifo:a- tion made under the impugned rules between the army personnel and the civilian personnel has no reasonable connection with the object that is sought to be served. 28. We demur. Why'! The 1950 Rules, m our view, have two pro- minent features which are basic. The first one which we have already empha~ised is that the military nominees do not shed their army service and merge into a new Service but undergo a partial absorption and preserve a substantial separatcne~s. The second feature, v.hich is perhaps more hurtful to the civilian sector, turns on Rule 5 which provides for seniority . The rule runs thus : 5. Seniority.-( l) On first appointment an officer will be in the grade of Deputy Superintending Surveyor (Formerly Assistant Super- intendent) in Class l Service of the Survey of India. (2) The ~cnionty of military officers inter se, will remain -the ~amc a.., in the army. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(5} Among those allotted to the same year, military officers wi' 1 rank seioior to directly recruited civilian officers. 29. Rule 5-A deals with promotion - officiating and substantive. A qualifying two-year probation and a further three years' service are a sine qua non for substantive promotion. But officiating promotions are open to all the officers, preference being given to those who have donel more years of actual survey work, regardless of seniority. Even officiating posting needs the qualifying service of two years and three years, earlier referred to. In this regard, the Class 11 officers who are directly promoted as SS have a debnite advantage over the military men. But when it comes to confirmation in !)Ubstantiv'e promotion posts, the military personnel opting into the Survey of India get the advantage of Rule 5 which bestows on them the added benefit of the period of service from the date of first commission in the army which may be anything between three to six years as against two years of antedated :,erv1ce which the civilian officers are entitled to tack on. 30. The 1960 Rules also require to be examined before we proceed to .i d1scuss10n. Rule 3 speaks of the sources of recruitment or appointment.

Another rule which mus.t be mentioned for a complete understand- ing is to the effect that Class II officers, when promoted to Class I, are directly appointed as SS and, therefore, can skip the lower position of DSS. 32. In 1970, the promotional scheme was slightly modified, but the thrust of the argument that military engineers enjoyed an advantage remained. 33. The attack made by the civilian wing, consisting of. two groups, namely, direct recruits and Class II promotees, is against three key rules of. the 1950 scheme, viz., Rules 5, 5-A and 11 and, of course, their correspond- ing 1970 provision based on Articles 14 and 16 and the High Court has substantially acceded on the basis that seniority prescriptions are based on irrelevant criteria and arbitrariness is writ large in some of the impugned provisions. The Court has struck down Rules 22-B, 22-E of the 1960 Rules and Rules 5(2), 5(3), 5(5), 7 and 11 of the 1950 rules. However, the Court has circumspectly declined to open the Pandora's box and restricted the refixation of seniority and review of promotions \"only from the date of the filing of the writ petition viz. March 5, 1974 , because if we do it from a back date, it would be unsettling the promotions that had already been given before a challenge is made by the petitioners\" . 34. This comprehensive narration is sufficient to inaugurate a discussion on the merits of the contentions after a formulation of the critical issues. JS. The points urged by the learned Attorney General are twofold. Neither Article 14 nor Article 16 is violated because the army recruits and the civilian entrants do not march into a common pool within the Service of the Survey of India. There are two sources or streams which flow into the Service but remain immiscible layers. Since the coostitutional mandate of equal treatment applies only to equals, it cannot apply to the given situation. Secondly, asswning there is a united cadre, even then Article 16 cannot invalidate the weightage for seniority assigned to the military recruits, since sensible supportive discrimen, having a rational relation to the object of the Service exists and that is sufficient panacea to cure the infirmity of differential treat- ment . He further pressed that it was perfectly permissible, having regard to the different sources, to prescribe a weightage at the time of the enf;ry into ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Thereafter, they are treated as equal for all purposes of promotion and what manifest advantage is derived by the DJ.ilitary men in their career is a cons equence of the initial addition of the commissioned service for the purposes of seniority. 36. These positions have been contested by Sri Govindan Nair, for the respondents, who has further argued that it is not proper for this Court to upset a finding of fact by the High Court unless there be something palpably erroneous on the face of the judgment. This is true and we should not lightly interfere save where there is a grave error. Before we discuss these points, we must clear the ground regaiding the necessity of the military presence in the survey Service. We have already quoted from the affidavit ori behalf of the Union of India, which gives condensed reasons for induction of army engineers into the Survey of India . That terse statement crystallises all that we have stated at some length earlier in this judgment. 37. An S . 0. S. and the Survey of India must go into action, maybe in the war-tom area, maybe for post-truce measurements. More military survey literature was placed in our hands by the learned Attorney General, making up for earlier defaults, to drive home the point that multifarious though the Survey's operations are, it does discharge duties secret, sensitive and strategic for defence requirements which necessitate the maintenance of an Army Engineering component willy-nilly. 38. This backdrop serves to highlight the issues on which we may turn the focus. We may now enter the area of encounter . What was a thorough- bred Military Engineering Corps suffered a metamorphosis by 1950 when a new set of rules of recruitment, composition and conditions of service, consistent with the new vision, rainbow of responsibilities and switch over to civilian departmentalisation, was brought about. 39. A critical dissection of the present set-up yields the result : While army engineers are definitely needed and are not expendable, the civilian accent on developmental work and the like justifies opening up the Service to recruits and promotees, non-military in source. Guided by this flexible realism and acting under the pro viso to Article 309 of the Constitution, the President cf India has made Rules in 1950 to regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of the army personnel coming into the Survey of India. The anatomy of the 1950 Rules is important. It reserves 50% for the military engineers by way of entitlement quota out of the total number to be recruited over a year as D.S. S. The other 50% was to have been divided equally between civilian recruits from the open market and the Class II officers. But, by an amendm ent of 1965, a modification was made to the effect that the promotees from Class II would enter the Class I Service d.irectly as S.S. and not as D S.S. Thus, the total number of vacancies each year at the D.S. S. level has to b e filled by recruitment in the proportion of 50 and 25. To illustrate for clarity , if there are 75 DSS vacancies in a given year, 50 of them are reserved for niilitary nominees and the remaining 25 are filled up by direct recruitment from the civilians. The expression 'recruitment' definitely means enlisting anew into a Service and so it may be taken that the army engineer- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

By way of contrast. the members of the Class IT Service have a quota of 25 % but that proportion is to be worked out, in terms of the extant rule, not based on the number of vacancies at the SS level but by a calculation of the total number of posts at the SS and higher levels in the Service. The total number of SS, Deputy Director<; and Directors will be added up and 25% thereof will be recruited by promotion from Class II Service. The recruitment is only to the posts of Superintending Surveyors although the number to be so promoted is based upon totalling up the various posts at and above the SS level. 41. The total number of vacancies at the DSS level for each year shall be divided in the ratio of 2 : 1 (50% for the Army Corps and 25% for direct recruits). The 50% reserved for the army corps shall be available to be filled by those candidates. The 25% seats to be filled by direct recruits shall be filled only hy such recruits Even if enough direct recruits are not available they will not be filled up by the army nominees but shall be kept vacant to be carried forward and fi1Ied in later years by such direct recruits. A reasonable period for the carry forward scheme will be 3 years, not more. Likewise, military vacancies at the DSS level each year shall be filled only by 5uch nominees . If enough such hands are not available, a similar procedure of carrv forward will govern. For the SS posts 25% belongs to promotees from Class II officers . The total number will be worked out by adding all the posts of SS, Deputy Directors and Directors and Surveyor General and allotting one-fourth of it as the quota for Class II promotees for appointment a,; SS Such is the reasonahle interpretation of the rule. 42. Now we come to the bitter bone of contention between the parties. Why should the 50% of military recruits be given a special weightage? Should not all entrants into the DSS be treated alike without being afforded a handicap in the race? We see no difficulty in upholding this weightage, once we accept the reality that the military portion of the Survey is a compelling factor for national defence. We hold, on a study of the materials already adverted to, that sans the army engineers the Survey of India will become a functional failure in lischarging its paramount duties in times of war and in spells of peace, defence spreads beyond hot war or cold war and sustains the sense of security by a state of ever readiness. There is enough literature to establish that the work done by the army wing of the Survey is far too important to be played with and such work is best done by that wing. 43. The military recruits, as has been already observed, are commissioned officers with 3 to 6 years of service. They have a certain salary scale and p~riod of service when they are baptised into the Survey of India. Giving due weight to these factors, Rule 5 lays down the criteria for seniority as hetween the military factor of recruits and the civilian counterparts. What needs to be appreciated i._ that for the very efficiency of the Survey o:( India, a substantial army element is 5tructurally essential. Army engineers are invited into this Service not because this department historically belonged to the Defence Forces but because it cannot minister to one of the major objectives of its creation if it does not have engineers with military training, aptitude, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The necessity of. the Survey, not opportunity to the army men, has determined the need to attract and. therefore, to allot a quota in the upper echelons, viz., Class I, for military engineer<,. This, in turn, has desiderated the offer of reasonable terms and conditions for anny men to join the Survey of India. The military engineers belong to the Corps of Engineer Officers. They are commissioned officers with service- of 3 to 6 years before coming into the Survey which needs, not raw engine , rs but men with some experience. They have prospects and scales of pay in the Defence department. Why should they look at the Survey if on ent1y they are to lose their commissioned service and begin the rat race with civilian freshers? Why should they suffer pay cut by walking into the Snrvey of India ? It is, therefore, fairly intelligible and basically equitable to allow military engineers credit for corr -nissioned service and protection of already earned higher salaries. 44. The reasomng is simple . The functional compulsions ot the Survey of India require army engineers to be inducted, say half its Class I strength. These engineering officers have to POSsess some years of experience. How, then, can they be attracted into the Survey except by assuring them what they were enioying in their existing Service, viz., credit for the years under com- mission in reckoning seniority and fitment of their salary at a point in the scale of Class I officers so that. by way of personal pay or otherwise, a cut may be obviated . This is not discrimination or favoured treatment but justice to those whom, of necessity. you want and must, therefore , pay what they were being paid in the Army and give service credit for the years on commission because you need men with specified years of commissioned service. To equate them with unequal civilian freshers is precisely the Procrnstean exercise which is unconstitutional equalitv anathematised by Article 14 . 45. Let us eye the issue from the ep;alitarian angle of Articles 14 and 16. Jt is trite law that equals shall be treated as equals and, in its application to public services, this simply means that once several persons have become members of one service they stand as equals and cannot, thereafter, be invidiously differentiated for purposes of salary, seniority, promotion or other- wise. based on the source of recruitment or other adventitious factor. Birth- marks of public servants are obliterated on entry into a common pool and our country does not believe in official castei..\"m or blue blood as assuring pre- ferential treatment in the future career. The basic assumption for the applica- tion of this principle is that the various members or groups of recruits have fused into or integrated as one common service. Merely because the sources of recruitment are '1.iff erent, there cannot be apartheidisation within the common service. 46. The case of the army enl?ineers is not that they should be given 'ethnic' preference in official life because of military superiority. They merely plead that unequals should not be forced into equality without regard to theit rights. . They are unequal because their 3 to 6 years of commissioned service cannot be wished away when brought into the Service shoulder to shoulder with raw recruits. Secondly, their salaries are higher and that should not be fodeited as punishment for entering the Survey Service .

The Service Rules safeguard both these - a just gesture without which many army engineers may not care to respond and the 'efficiency' factor of the Survey Service will fail in their absence. 47. The learned Attorney General also adopted the precedentially sanctified route of .:scape from the magnetic field of Articles 14 and 16, that if the two sources of entry never really flowed into a homogenised sangam but remained the Ganga and the Jamuna, no question of equality arose. A common pool where the plurality meets is a necessary postulate for the application of the equalist mandate . Here the army engineers, it is apparent from the rules, essentia11y continue to be army men but wear pro tempore Survey apparel, to be doffed any time specified in the rules themselves. Resultantly. the military and civilian members remain immiscible layers save for some purposes. The condition of integration of men from the divergent sources being absent, rulings have held Article 16 is out of the way . Once it is agreed or found that at the entrance point the armv engineers are justly given credit for the com- missioned service which they carry with them, there is no further discrimination while in service on the score that they come from the Corps of Engineer Officers. All that happens thereafter is merely a manifestation of initial advantage of credit for commissioned s~rvice. For this reason. we negative the case of discrimination. 48. The relevant rulings nor to burden but to brighten the points urged, mav be referred to. In B. S. Gupta case 11 where Article 16 was agitated in a battle between promotees and direct recruits. one facet of Service Juris- prudence was illumined. We excerpt: When considering this point it must be clearly understood that this Court is not concerned with government's policv in recruiting officers •o any service. Government runs the Service and it is presumed tbat it knows what is best in the public interest. Government knows the calibre of candidates available and it is for the government to determine how a particu1ar Service is to be manned - whether by direct recruits or by promotees or both and, if by both. what should be the ratio between the two sources havin'1: regard to the age factor, experience and other exigencies of S{\"rvice. Commissions and Committees appointed by the government may indeed give useful advice but ultimately it is for the government to decide for itself. Tn the next place we have to remember that it would be wrong to p1 onounce adversely upon the new seniority rule merely because of it~ impact on the fortunes of any particular individual officer. Nor will it he correct to point out that an individual officer 'A' wou1d have fared better if the old quota rule and weightage rule had been restored. 7 We have to take an overall view to determine whether the rule now framed by the government to determine seniority is just and fair. s 6.

Absent fusion into one integrated service, Article 16 is not attracted, is a proposition entrenched by precedents. In Shujat Ali case 9 , this Court pithily put it : (SCC p. 107, para 28) The two categories of Supervisors were thus never fused into one class and no question of unconstitutional ·discrimination could arise by reason of differential treatment being given to them. 50. Ve have read Shelat , J.'s observations in Wadhwa case 10 to reinforce our view: The principles on which discrimination and breach of Articles 14 and 16 can be said to result have been by now so well settled that we do not thi•1k it necessary to repeat them here once again. To sum up the position, the two services were from as early as 1937 and before separate. At no stage, even after provincialisation was decided upon and the principles of its implementation were drawn up there was any int egration of the two . In fact, after considering the alternatives which the government had before it, it opted , on con- sideration of difficulties of integration, for the alternative of keeping the two separate. 11 No principle under Articl e 14 or Article 16 is involved if such an integration was not brought about, for, considering the past history of the two services and the differences existing between them, government could not be required to fuse them into one upon any principle emanating from the two articles. 12 Going backwards still further, we find Ayyangar, J. , in Joginder Singh13 empha- tically enunciating the same proposition : 9. 10. If, we hold, there was no integration (and integration has no meaning unless it is complete , for there is no such thing as partial integra- tion) either expressly or by necessary implication, it wou1d follow that it was not the impugned rules that created the two distinct cadres but that they existed independently of the rules and the only charge that could be laid against the rules in this respect was that they failed to effect an integration. If the government order of September 27 , 1957, did not integrate them into a single Service , it would follow that the two remained as they started as two distinct services. If they were distinct services, there was no question of inter se seniority between members of the two services, nor of any comparison between the two in the matter of promotion for founding an argument based upon Article 14 or Mr,hamrnad Shujat Ali v.

To pursue pre- cedents beyond a point is a tiring adventure which reaches a point of no return. It is too late to upset settled law save where the point of extra- vaganza is reached. Here such a situation is yet to come. 51. Again, Sri Govindan Nair's submission suffers damage from the following observations in Ganga Ram case 16 : The direct recruits and the promotees like the petitioners, in our opinion, clearly constitute different classes and this classification is sustainable on intelligible differentia which has a reasonable connection with the object of efficiency sought to be achieved. The distinction between direct recruits and promotees as two sources of recruitment being a recognised difference, not obnoxious to the equality clauses, the provisions which concern us cannot be struck down on the ratio of this decision. 17 52. Let us examine the facts briefly to see whether the fundamentals of constitutional equality are followed in the Service scheme. The army engineers remain in 'uniform' as it were but wear a Survey of India overcoat. They do not merge or fuse into a <;ingle integrated service with the civilian recruits but remain as an immiscible layer of the Class I Service, the other layer being the civilians. The two wings remain close but separate, not one homo-- genised family, as the various rules eloquently proclaim. 53. The army engineers are formally part of the Survey of India but factually retain the vital pattern of life of the army and close nexus with their official prospects, conditions and control as if they had continued in the army. The 1950 Rules bring out the following incidents of service boldly. Notwithstanding theit having left the Corps Engineer Officers Service and entering the Survey Service, they continue to wear uniforms, they get notional promotionSI in the army when they earn corresponding promotions in the Survey of India. More significantly, they secure army promotions only if they pass the requisite army tests ab extra. They can be recalled by the army and, for a certain period, they themselves may opt back to the army. They continue to be broadly under the control of the Commander-in-Chief and when inefficiency is noticed, they can be called back to the army for being dealt with appropriately. They have to undergo the regular periodical drills in the anny and their disciplinary control is not divested from the Army Chiefs. There are many other such details, the cumulative impact of which is that they have two masters, as it were; they are in two Services, as it were; they are under two parents - natural and adopted. This is a unique pattern where the army members remain with one foot in the army and the other in the ~urvey of 14. 196!1 Suep 2 SCR 169, 19!1 15. S. G. Jaisitrghani v.

A conspectus of the facts and circumstances governing the service convinces us that there is no total integration of the army personnel into the Survey Service. They are in it and yet out of it. This is what we may call a sui generis Service and indubitably it can be asserted that they have not fullv fused into a common pool. Absent such complete integration, Articles 14 or 16 cannot be invoked. 54. The present case plainly falls in the hands-off zone and so the court must ]eave the inju,;;tice, if any, to be corrected, if needed, by other proce!l--ies. Our exploration has revealed that the Survey of India is a civnian department rendering varied services to non-defence spheres of the Central Government and to State Governments. So its composition cannot be reasonably confined to military personnel only. But critical defence-oriented work is also done, not onlv in seasons of national emergencv but also during peace spans. The border line between national security by the defence forces and developmental proiects by civil services is becoming obsolete. Defence is not onlv on the battle front but also in the strategic rear, in the farms and factories, in efficient suoplies and ec:;sential service,;;, in mapping second lines of defence and routes of troop movements, aJl of them having to be executed on a war footing. w;ngs which can be mobilised at instant's notice, forces which will build with blitz speed , have to be in the sheath to be drawn out like a sword on an alarm sima1. More than all, as earlier elaborated, the tasks; of the Survev for the defence are in times of emergency top priority items. So a sizeable section of men with armv background, and military aptitude, with ouick reflexes and familiar with defence team-work. must be kept in reserve an the time. It fo1Jows that a ~ood prooortion of army en~neers are a 'must' for the Survev. Js; it enough to have 25% or 50% from military enl!ineers is a matter of fine-tuning of policy for which the judiciary has no genius and the Adminic:;tration has a reach of materials and range of expertise so that courts must keep out. save where irrational criteria, irrelevant factors, mala fide motives or gross folly enter the verdict. 55. Have any such invalidatory infirmities been established by the challengers here- ? If the induction of the armv engineers has a nexus with the raison d'etre of the Survey of India, the exact dosage needed to be drawn from that source for functional adeauacv is not susceptible of iudicial measurement. If gross exaggeration is indulged in to boost the military component or non-existent or Hlusorv reauirements are invented for the same purpose, taking for ~nted iudicial gullibiJitv or jurisdictional exile, the Court will call the bluff. But here 50% of Class I services, from a historical need-based or other approach, cannot be called irrational, impertinent or improvident. 56. Likewise, the award of the length of commic;sioned services in the army as service in the Survey of India cannot be dismissed as arbitrary or irrelevant. The necessity to attract such officers is a factor. The reality of their engineering experience on commission cannot be wished away. The value of such experience for the Survey of India with defence commitments argues itself . Whether such services should be given credit wholly or at all in the new Service is more a matter of pragmatic wi<sdom beyond the bounds of irrationality, arbitrary fancy or departmental quasi-nepotism.

Sri Govindan Nair , with assertive argument, gave us anxious moments when he pleaded for minimum iustice to the civilian elements. He said that the impugned rules were so designed, or did so result in the working , that all civilians , recruit or promotee, who came in with equal expectations like bis military analogue, would be so outwitted at all higher levels that promotions, t-ven in Jong official careers would be hopes that sour into dupes and promises that wither away as teasing illusions.

After all, civilian entrants are not expendab)e commodities, especia1ly when considerable civil developtnental under- takin!.Ys sustain the sjze of the service . And their contentment through pro- motional avenues is a relevant factor . The Survev of India is not a civil service 'sold' to the military , stampeded by war psychosis. Nor does the philosophy of Article 14 or Article 16 contemplate de iure classification and de facto cac;teification in public services based on some meretricious or plausible differentiation.

This tendencv. in an elitist societv with a diehard caste mentality, is a dis-;ervke to our foundin~ faith , even if fudicially sancHfied. Subba Rao, J , hit the nail on the bead when he cautioned in Lschhman Da~ v. State of Pnnjab 20 : The doctrine of cla-;sification is only a subsidiarv rule evolved by courts to give a nractical content to the \"aid doctrine. Over-emphasis on the doctrine of cla-;sification or an anx ious and sustained attempt to di-;cover some basis for cla<;sification may qraduallv and im~rcentihly devrive the article of its gJoriom content. That process would inevitably end in substituting the doctrine of classification for the doctrine of equalitv : the fundamental ri!!ht to equaHtv before the law and the equal protection of the laws may be replaced by the doctrine of classification. The quintes.,ence of the constitutional code of equality is brought out also by Ro'<e, J. in Bidi Supply Co. case 21 : The truth is that it is impossible to be precise, for we are dealing with intangibles and though the results are dear it is impossib?e to pin the thought down to any precise analysis.

It embodies a general awareness in the consciousness of the people at large of something that exists and which is very real but which cannot be pinned down to any precise analysis of fact save to say ,in a given case that it falls this side of the line or that, and because of that decisions on the same point wilt vary as conditions vary, one conclusion in one part of the country and another somewhere else ; one decision today and another tomorrow when the basis of society has altered and the structure of current social thinking is different. It is not the law that alters but the changing conditions of the times and Article 14 narrows down to a question of fact which must be deter- mined by the highest Jud~es in the land as each case arises. 58. The constitutional goal is to break down inequalities steadily between m:m and man, whether based on status or talent. Masses of men have suffered so long from social suppressions and environmental inhibitions and to deliver them out of such stratification and petrification came the message of social justice, blowing like winds of change, with an ac.cent on distributive justice ensured by the rule of real equal opportunity. This basic mandate of equality cannot be subverted by the pragmatic plea of classified' equality without robbing Articles 14 to 16 of their spiritual kernel in the process of decoding. Status quo values must wither away in the march to the constitutional goals. Every Article of Part ID is an article of faith of our nation and is the formal expression of a moral-spiritual mandate, not a string of' words whose meaning of meanings can be played with by inte1lectual exercises favouring the Establish~ ment. The paramount law is value-loaded. Our freedom is in peril if equality is, by judicial reconstruction, a refined validation of inequality. Princes shall be treated equally but pariahs will continue where they are - Why ? Because Article 14 means only equality among equals, a self-evident statement without solemn pronouncement. Mr. Justice Subba Rao, in Lacbbman Das case 22 warned against this pernicious potential. We pollute our cultural stream if we narrow the flow of constitutional equality to the little trickle of equals being made equals. The dynamic demand of levelling up unequals to the level of the higher brackets is non-negotiable albeit gradual. 59. This caveat is sounded in ~e last paragraph of the majority judgment in Triloki Nath 28 and is writ large in the whole of the concurring minority judgment. It binds : But we hope that this judgment will not be construed as a charter for making minute and microcosmic classifications. Excellence is, or ought to be, the goal of all good government and excellence and equality are not friendly bed-fe11ows. A pragmatic approach has therefore to be adopted in order to hannonize the requirements of public services with the aspirations of public servants. But let us not evolve, through imperceptible extensions, a theory of classification which may mbvert, perhaps submerge, the precious guarantee of equality. The eminent spirit of an ideal society is equality and ~o we mu~t not be left to ask in 22. (196!) 7 SCR 353 2,.

The point Sri Govindan Nair ma.de from Triloki Nath19 is, on principle, well taken but, on facts, fallacious. The learned Attorney General, in the last instalment of information furnished in the course of. his reply, did convince us that no such disaster as was painted did or would befall unless we take a myopic view. 61. If we had b.ecn satisfied that the end-product of the provision (Rule 5) was a manipulation of continued seniority, beyond allowance for some differences, a perpetual suppression of the civilian wing and a back-door entry into and occupancy of all higher positions by the military men, it might have been a mockery of equality . But the story is that some advantage is secured by the military recruits which is intended and justified. Certainly, in the pro- mC'tional scale this will be reflected. But no monopoly of all promotions vests in the commissioned · recruits. It is a case of fluctuating fortunes, inevitable in interlacing two sets of people coming from two sources with different back- grounds and assets. As expressed earlier, rigid or relentless equalisation of divergent categories who have been brought into one Service is the Procrustean bed process, contrary to democratic social dynamics . 62. In the first few years, the army wing had a better deal but in the next spell the civilian wing more than ma.de up. In the next span some change occurs and a projection into the decade ahead shows that the civilians will outnumber the army men at the next two tiers. Maybe, the Surveyor General may continue to be a 'uniformed' engineer. We do not see the pathetic picture held out by counsel and the differenres we do notice are distances away from the creation of class legislation. We do not strike down the rule as constitutionally obnoxious. 63. Sri Govindan Nair drew our attention to Pay Com.mission Reports which had strongly recommended fair treatment to the civilian wing by making the higher positions realistically accessible to them. Prima facie, there is some grievance if promotions at the top are totally sealed off, not in law but in fact. And simmering discontent of a whole wing is no small matter. Maybe, when the apex is occupied always by a 'brass' boss the working of the rules and of the department may be tilted. We do consider that recommendations of the Pay Commission deserve Central Government's early attention. Flcm.blc provisions for promotion to higher positions which will not make the depart- ment lop-sided, or vertical division of the civilian and military wings without injury to integrity and efficiency may meet the needs of equality. Policy is for the executive, not the judicative wing. We :find no unconstitutionality but discontent should not be neglected in good government. 64. A measure of agreement, with marginal differences in the inter- pretation of the rules, emerged in the course of the debate. We may as well set it down to avoid future doubt. The learned Attorney General stated, with a view to silence the grievance of the respondents, that for promotions beyond Superintending Surveyor, even officiating SS are considered. It is not right to contend,. he said, that only on confirmation they are considered for pro- motion as Deputy Directors. Indeed, the learned Attorney General pointed ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

If the officiating SSs are also included for higher promotion based on merit the wind of inequity is, pro tanto, taken out of the civilian sails. 65. Likewise, it is useful to clarify in the light of the 1965 amendment to the Rules providing for Class II officers being promoted straight as SS (not DSS), that the recruitment to the DSS vacancies each year and to the SS by promotion from Class II each year shall be as explained earlier. 66. Sri Govindan Nair, apprehending adverse winds in reversal of the High Court's conclusion, raised fresh contentions which he was not permitted to put forward because they were new and urged only in the Supreme Court. Creative thinking is good, if it dawns in good time ; for, according to our processual law, argwnents unborn on the record in the High Court have no chance as a postscript in the Supreme Court. For instance, he urged that commissioned officers governed by the Army Act could not be governed by any other Service Rules. So much so, the 19 50 Rules, being a deviation from the Anny Rules, were invalid. We illustrate but not exhaust and, in any case, do not investigate. 67. The social philosophy of our fundamental law is a perennial flow, rising and falling, rushing to push out obstructing rocks and slowing to erode a doctrinal distortion, the power being geared to the good of the people in teems of Justice, social, economic and political. From this futuristic stand- point, every decision of the Supreme Court is the focal point of the battle of the tenses, of social change versus social stability. We leave these seminal issues for future consideration when they more directly demand decision. Enough unto the day is the evil thereof. 68. We allow the appeals but intricate constitutional questions when decided by this Court to declare the law under Article 141 should be an exception to the conventional rule of costs following the event, unless other circum~tances warnmt So no costs.
