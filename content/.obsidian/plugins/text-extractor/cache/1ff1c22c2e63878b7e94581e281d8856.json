Mahavir Singh filed a petition before the Delhi High Court claiming to be appointed as a scheduled caste candidate in the reserved seat. This petition was dismissed by the Delhi High Court and he therefore came to this Court by a special leave petition which was granted and in Mahavir Singh v. Staff Selection Committee 2 this Court allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment of the Delhi High Court and observed that Raj Kumar case1 does not lay down good law and it was directed that he be given the benefit of reserva- tion on the basis of his position in the merit list. 3. It is alleged in this petition that consequently Mahavir Singh has been appointed and it is because of this that the present petitioner bled the present petition. 4. The facts are not disputed. The only contention by the res- pondent in this petition is that as the petitioner on the date of applica- tion had crossed the age of 30 years even as a scheduled caste candidate he could not be appointed as there was no relaxation of age for scheduled caste candidates. Learned counsel for the petitioner drew our attention to instructions issued in July 1976 wherein it was specifically directed that in case of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates the age limit will be relaxable up to 35 years. After seeing these departmental instructions even the learned counsel appearing for the rei,pondent was not in a position to challenge these instructions. It is because of this that his application was not rejected. It is also not disputed that if the age could be relaxed up to 35 years the petitioner is entitled to be appointed on the basis of reservation for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates. Under these circum- stances therefore the petition deserves to succeed. It is rather unfortunate that a scheduled caste candidate who had secured a good position in merits and was placed at No. 12 still he could not be appointed for all these years and ultimately had to come to this Court for redress of his grievance. Petition is therefore allowed with costs of Rs 5000 and it is directed that the petitioner will be appointed as a Sub-Inspector of Police forthwith. ( 1987) 1 Supreme Court Ca■•• 378 (BEFORE P.N.

Immediately at the conclusion of each session of the State legislature, a circular letter used to be sent by the Special Secretary in the Department of Parliamentary Affairs to all the Commissioners, Secretaries etc. intimating to them that the session of the legislature had been 'got prorogued' and that under Article 213(2)(a) all the ordinances would cease to be in force after six weeks of the date of reassembly of the legislature and that they should therefore get in touch with the Law Department and take immediate action to get \"all the concerned ordinances repromulgated\", so that all those ordinances are posillvely repromulgated before the date of their expiry. This circular letter also used to advise the officers that if the old ordinances were repromulgated in their original form without any amendment, the approval of the Council of Ministers would not be necessary. The petitioners m...,\\<ed writ petitions before Supreme Court under Article 32 questioning this practice in the State of Bihar of repromulgation of ordinances as a legitimate exercise of tho power of the Governor under Article 213 of the Constitution. Peutioner l, a Professor in the Gokhale Institute of Pohtics and Economics, Pune was deeply interested in the preservation and promotion of constitu- tional functioning of the administration in the country. He carried out thorough and detailed research in the matter of repromulgation of ordinances by the Governor of Bihar from time to time and published the result in a book entitled \"RepromulgatJ.on of Ordinances : Fraud on the ConstitutJ.on of India\". Petitioner 2, an occupancy raiyat in Ranchi, Bihar growing forest produce m his raiyat land, was affected by the restrictions imposed by the Bihar Forest Produce- (Regulation of Trade) Third Ordinance, 1983.

(Para 4) The startling facts show that the executive in Bihar had almost taken over the role of the legislature in making laws, not for a limited period, but for years together in disregard of the constitutional limtatons. Thi~ was clearly contrary to the constitutional scheme and was improper and invalid. Accordingly, the Bihar Intermediate Education Council Ordinance, being still in operation, must be struck down. (Paras 8 and 9) The repromulgation of the ordinance may not be open to attack when it is not possible for the government to introduce and push through in the legislature a Bill containing the same provisions as in the ordinance, because ol too much legislative business in a particular session or limited time at the disposal of the legislature in a particular session, but, otherwise, it would be a colourable exercise of power on the part of the executive to continue an ordinance with substantially the same provisions beyond the period limited by the Constilution, by adopting the methodology of repromulgation. !>uch a stratagem would be repugnant to the constitutional scheme, as 1t would enable the executive to transgress its constitutional lurulation m the matter ot law- making in an emergent situation and to covertly and indirectly arrogate to itsdf and usurp the law-making function of the legislature. That would be subverting the democratic process which lies at the core of the coru.titutional scheme. The power to promulgate an ordinance 1s essentially a power to be used to meet an extraordinary situauon and it cannot be allowed to be \"perverted to serve pohtical ends\".

The question is, can the Governor go on repromulgating ordinances for an indefinite period of time and thus take over to himself the power of the legislature to legislate though that power is conferred on him under Article 213 only for the purpose of enabling him to take immediate action at a time when the legislative assembly of the State is not in session or when in a case where there is a legislative council in the State, both Houses of ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The facts giving rise to these writ petitions are disturbing and we may briefly state them as follows: 2. These writ petitions have been filed by four petitioners challenging the validity of the practice of the State of Bihar in promulgating and re- promulgating ordinances on a massive scale and in particular they have challenged the constitutional validity of three different ordinances issued by the Governor of Bihar, namely, (i) Bihar Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Third Ordinance, 1983, (ii) The Bihar Intermediate Education Council Tlurd Ordinance, 1983, and (iii) The Bihar Bricks Supply (Control) Third Ordinance, 1983. Petitioner l is a professor of economics in the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, Pune and he has spent a number of years in studying the constitutional functioning of Indian politics. He is deeply interested in the preservation and promotion of constitutional functioning of the administration in the country . He has made a deep and profound study of the practice which is being followed in the State of Bihar of promulgating and repromulgating ordinances from time to time without enacting them into Acts of the legislature. Petitioner 2 is an occupancy raiyat of village Anigara, Kunti Police Station in the district of Ranchi. He grows forest produce in his raiyat land. Clause (5) of the Bihar Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) I bird Ordinance, l 983 imposes restriction on the sale of specified forest produce and it further created State monopoly for -;ale and purchase of such forest produce. Clause (7) of this ordinance conferred power on the State Government to fix the price at which the specified forest produce may be purchased by it or by anv authorised forest officer or agent from the growers of such forest produce . The effect of these proVi'lions in the Bihar Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Third Ordinance was that petitioner 2 was prevented from selling his forest produce to any purchaser other than those mentioned in the ordinance and his right to dispo~e of the forest produce was adversely affected by these provisions and he was therefore interested in challenging the com.titutional validity of this ordinance. Petitioner 3 i!I a student studying in Intermediate (Science) Class in A.N. College, Patna . He was affected by the Bihar Intermediate Education Council Third Ordinance. It is not necessary to ref er to the provisions of this ordinance since it could not be seriously disputed on behalf of the respondents that the provisions of this ordinance affected, cm tailed and/or regulated the rights of petitioner 3 or at lecist had the potential of doing so and petitioner 3 therefore challenged the constitu- tional validity of this ordinance . Similarly petitioner 4 was aggrieved by the Bihar Brick Supply (Control) Third Ordinance because he is the pro• prietor of South Bihar Agency, Patna, a brick manufacturing concern operating under a licence issued by the Mining and the Industry Departmt'nt of the Government of Bihar and the provisions of this ordinance empowering the State Government to control and regulate the manufacture, distribution, transport, disposal and consumption of bricks, as also the price at which the brick~ may be bought or sold affected petitioner 4 and he accordingly ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF BIHAR (Bhagwati, C.J.) 383 joined the writ petition and challenged the constitutional validity of this ordinance. 3 It was contended on behalf of the respondents that the petitioners had no locus standi to maintain this writ petition since out of the three ordinances challenged on behalf of the petitioners, two of them, namely, Bihar Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Third Ordinance, 1983 and the Bihar Bricks Snpply (Control) Third Ordinance, 1983 had already lapsed and their provisions were enacted into Acts of the legislature and so far as the third ordinance, namely, the Bihar Intermediate Education Council Third Ordinance was concerned, a legislative proposal was already introduced for enacting its provisions into an Act. The respondents also contended that the petitioners are not entitled to challenge the practice prevalent in the State of Bihar of repromulgating ordinances from time to time since they were merely outsiders who had no legal interest to challenge the validity of this practice. We do not think this preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents is well founded. It is undoubtedly true that the provisions of two out of the three ordinances challenged in these writ petitions were enacted into Acts of the legislature but that happened only during the pendency of these writ petitions and at the date when the5.e writ petitions were filed, these two ordinances were very much in operation and affected the interest of petitioners 2 and 4 respectively. Moreover, the third ordinance, namely, the Bihar Intermediate Education Council Third Ordinance is still in operation though a bill incorporating the provisions of this ordinance is pending consideration before the State legislature and it has been referred to a Select Committee and the right of petitioner 3 to pursue a particular course of study is vitally affected by the provisions contained in that ordinance. Besides petitioner l is a Professor of Political Sc.ience and is deei-'ly interested in ensuring proper implementation of the constitutional provisions. He has sufficient interest to maintain a petition under Article 32 even as a member of the public because it is a right of every citizen to insist that he should be governed by laws made in accordance with the Constitution and not laws made by the executive in violation of the constitutional provisions . Of course, if any particular ordinance was being challenged by petitioner l he may not have the locus slandi to challenge it simply as a member of the public unless some legal right or interest of his is violated or threatened by such ordinance, but here what petitioner 1 as a member of the public is complaining of is a practice which is being followed by the State of Bihar of repromulgating the ordinances from time to time without their provisions being enacted into Acts of the legislature. It is clearly for vindication of public interest that petitioner 1 has filed these writ petitions and he must therefore be held to be entitled to maintain his writ petitions. In S.P. Gupta v.

[A]ny member of the public having sufficient interest can maintain an action for judicial redress for public injury arising from breach of public duty or from violation of some provision of the Consti• tution or the law and seek enforcement of such public dnty and obsf'rvance of such constitutional or legal provision. (emphasis in original) The rule of law constitutes the core of our Constitution and it is the essence of the rule of law that the exercise of the power by the State whether it be the legislature or the executive or any other authority should be within the constitutional limitations and if any practice is adopted by the executive which is in flagrant and systematic violation of its constitutional limitations, petitioner 1 as a member of the public would have sufficient interest to challenge such practice by filing a writ petition and it would be the consti• tutional duty of this Court to entertain the writ petition and adjudicate upon the validity of such practice. We must therefore reject the preliminary contention raised on behalf of the respondents challenging the locus of the petitioners to maintain these writ petitions. 4. The respondents then contended that in any event the question raised before the court in these writ petitions was academic in nature and should not be adjudicated upon by the court. But this contention urged on behalf of the respond<\"nts is also without force since the Bihar Intermediate Education Council Third Ordinance is still in force and it cannot therefore be said to be academic to examine the challenge to its constitutional validity. Moreover the question raised in these writ petitions is of highest constitu- tional importance as it dof'S the power of the Governor to repromulgate ordinances and it is in public interest that the executive should know what are the limitations on the power of the Governor in the matter of re- promulgation of ordinances, If this question is not decided on merits, the correct position in regard to the constitutional limitations on the power of the Governor to repromulgate ordinances will remain undete1·mined. We are of the view that this question has great public importance and it must be decided by us on merits in order to afford guidance to the Governor in the exercise of his power to repromulgate ordinances from time to time. 5. We shall now proceed to state how the Governor in the State of Bihar has been indulging in the practice of repromulgating the ordinances from time to time so as to keep them alive for an indefinite period of time. Petitioner 1 carried out a thorough and detailed research in the matter of repromulgation of ordinances by the Governor of Bihar from time to time and the result of this research was compiled by him and published in a bcok entitled '' Repromulgation of Ordinances: Fraud on the Constitution of India\". Some of the relevant extracts from this book have been annexed to the writ petition indicating the number of ordinances repromulgated repeatedly by the Governor of Bihar.

This would be clear from the fact that on August 26, 1973 the Governor of Bihar repromulgated 54 ordinances with the same provisions and on January 17, 1973, 49 ordinances were repromulgated by the Governor of Bihar containing substantially the same provisions and again on April 27, 1974, 7 ordinances were repromulgated and on April 29, 1974, 9 ordinances were 1epromulgated with substantially the same provisions. Then again on July 23, 1974, 51 ordinances were repromulgated which included the self-same ordinances which had been repi-omulgated on April 27 and 29, 1974. On March 18, 1979, 52 ordinances were repromulgated while on August 18, 1979, 51 ordinances were repromulgated containing substantially the same provisions. 49 ordinances were repromulgated on April 28, 1979 and on August 18, 1979, 51 ordinances were repromulgated. This exercise of making mass repromulgation of ordinances on the prorogation of the session of the State legislature continued unabated and on August 11, 1980, 49 ordinances were repromulgated while on January 19, 1981, the number of ordinances repromulgated was as high as 53.

So far as the Bihar Intermediate Education Council Third Ordinance is concerned it was initially promulgated in 1982 and after its expiry, it was again repromulgated by the Governor-of Bihar four times with the same provisions and it was ultimately allowed to lapse on June 6, 1985, but then the Bihar Intermediate Education Council Ordinance, 1985 was promulgated which contained almost the same provisions as those contained in the Bihar lntermtdiate Education Council Third Ordinance.

The Government of Bihar, it seems, made it a settled practice to go on repromulgating the ordinances from time to time and this was done methodologically and with a sense of deliberateness. Immediately at the conclusion of each session of the State legislature, a circular letter used to be sent by the Special Secretary in the Department of Parlia- mentary Affairs to all the Commissioners, Secretaries, Special Secretaries, Additional Secretaries and all Heads of Departments intimating to them that the session of the legislature had been got prorogued and that under Article 213 clause (2)(a) of the Constitution all the ordinances would cease to be in force after six weeks of the date of reassembly of the legislature and that they should therefore get in touch with the Law Department and immediate action should be initiated to get \"all the concerned ordinances repromulgated\", so that all those ordinances are positively repromulgated before the date of their expiry. This circular letter also used to advise the officers that if the old ordinances were repromulgated in their original form without any amendment, the approval of the Council of Ministers would not be necessary. The petitioners placed before the court a copy of one such circular letter dated July 29, 1981 and it described the subject of the communication as \"regarding repromulgation of ordinances\". It would be profitable to reproduce this circular letter dated July 29, 1981 as it indicates the routine manner in which the ordinances were repromul- gated by the Governor of Bihar: Letter No. P .A./Misc. 1040/80-872 Government of Bihar Department of Parliamentary Affairs From Basant Kumar Dubey Special Secretary to the Govt.

STATE OF BIHAR (Bhagwati, C.J.) 391 Under the:: provisions of Article 213(2)(a) of the Constitution all the ordinances cease to be in force after six weeks <if the date of the reassembly of the legislature. This time the session of the Legislative Assembly has begun on June 29, 1981 and that of the Legislative Council on July 1, 1981. Therefore from July 1, 1981, six weeks, that is, 42 days would be completed on August 11, 1981 and if they are not repromulgated before the aforesaid date, then all the ordinances will cease to be in force after August 11, 1981. It is, therefore, requested that the Law Department may be contacted and immediate action be initiated to get all the concerned ordinances repromulgated so that they are definitely repromulgated before August 11, 1981. If the old ordinances are repromulgated in their original form without any amendment, then the approval of the Council of Ministers is not necessary. This should be given the topmost priority and necessary action should be taken immediately. Yours faithfully, Sd/-Basant Kumar Dubey Special Secretary to Bihar Government This circular letter clearly shows beyond doubt that the repromulgation of the ordinances was done on a massive scale in a routine manner without even caring to get the ordinances replaced by Acts of the legislature or considering whether the circumstances existed which rendered it necessary for the Governor to take immediate action by way of repromulgation of the ordinances. The government seemed to proceed on the basis that it was not necessary to introduce any legislation in the legislature but that the law could be continued to be made by the government by having the ordinances repromulgated by the Governor from time to time. The question is whether this practice followed by the Government of Bihar could be justified as representing legitimate exercise of power of promulgating ordinances conferred on the Governor under Article 213 of the Constitution. 7. The determination of this question depends on the true interpreta- tion of Article 213 which confers power on the Governor of a State to promulgate ordinances. This article insofar as material, reads as follows : 213. (1) If at any time, except when the Legislative Assembly of a State is in session, or where there is a Legislative Council in a State, except when both Houses of the legislature are in session, the Governor is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action, he may promulgate such ordinances as the circumstances appear to him to require : * * * * * (2) An ordinance promulgated under this article shall have the same force and effect as an Act of the legislature of the State assented to by the Governor, but every such ordinance- (a) shall be laid before the Legislative Assembly of the State, or ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Explanation.-Where the Houses of the legislature of a State having a Legislative Council are summoned to re-assemble on different dates, the period of six weeks shall be reckoned from the later of those dates for the purposes of this clause. The power conferred on the Governor to issue ordinances is in the nature of an emergency power which is vested in the Governor for taking immediate action where such action may become necessary at a time when the legislature is not in session. The primary law making authority under the Constitution is the legislature and not the executive but it is possible that when the legislature is not in session circumstances may arise which render it necessary to take immediate action and in such a case in order that public interest may not suffer by reason of the inability of the legislature to make law to deal with the emergent situation, the Governor is vested with the power to promulgate ordinances. But every ordinance promulgated by the Governor must be placed before the legislature and it would cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of the legislature or if before the expiration of that period a resolution disapproving it is passed by the Legislative Assembly and agreed to by the Legislative Council, if any. The object of this provision is that since the power conferred on the Governor to issue ordinances is an emergent power exercisable when the legislature is not in session, an ordinance promulgated by the Governor to deal with a situation which requires immediate action and which cannot wait until the legislature reassembles, must necessarily have a limited life. Since Arti- cle 174 enjoins that the legislature shall meet at least twice in a year but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session and an ordinance made by the Governor must cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of the legislature, it is obvious that the maximum life of an ordinance cannot exceed sevc.n and a half months unless it is replaced by an Act of the legislature or disapproved by the resolution of the legislature before the expiry of that period. The power to promulgate an ordinance is essentially a power to be used to meet an extraordinary situation and it cannot be allowed to be \"perverted to serve political ends\". It is contrary to all democratic norms that the executive should have the power to make a Jaw, but in order to meet an emergent situation, this power is conferred on the Governor and an ordinance issued by the Governor in exercise of this power must, therefore, of necessity be limited in point of time. That is why it is provided that the ordinance shall cealie to operate ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The Constitution-makers expected that if the provisions of the ordinance are to be continued in force, this time should be sufficient for the legislature to pass the necessary Act. But if within this time the legislature does not pass such an A.et, the ordinance must come to an end. The executive cannot continue the provisions of the ordinance in force without going to the legislature. The law-making function is entrusted by the Constitution to the legislature consisting of the representatives of the people and if the executive were permitted to continue the provisions of an ordinance in force by adopting the methodology of repromulgation without submitting to the voice of the legislature, it would be nothing short of usurpation by the executive of the law-making function of the legislature. The executive cannot by taking resort to an emergency power exercisable by it only when the legislature is not in session, take over the law-making function of the legislature. That would be clearly subverting the democratic process which lies at the core of our constitutional scheme, for then the people would be governed not by the laws made by the legislature as provided in the Constitu- tion but by laws made by the executive . The government cannot by-pass the legislature and without enacting the provisions of the ordinance into an Act of the legislature, repromulgate the ordinance as soon as the legislature is prorogued. Of course, there may be a situation where it may not be possible for the government to introduce and push through in the legislature a Hill containing the same provisions as in the ordinance, because the legislature may have too much legislative business in a particular session or the time at the disposal of the legislature in a particular Session may be short, and in that event, the Governor may legitimately find that it is necessary to repromulgate the ordinance. Where such is the case, re- promulgation of the ordinance may not be open to attack. But, otherwise, it would be a colourable exercise of power on the part of the executive to continue an ordinance with substantially the same provisions beyond the period limited by the Constitution, by adopting the methodology of repromul- gation. It is settled law that a constitutional authority cannot do indirectly what it is not permitted to do directly. If there is a constitutional provision inhibiting the constitutional authority from doing an act, such provision cannot be allowed to be defeated by adoption of any subterfuge. That would be clearly a fraud on the constitutional provision. This is precisely what was pointed out by Mukherjea, J. speaking for the Court in K .C. Gajapati Narayan Deo v. State of Orissa2 : In other words, it is the substance of the Act that is material and not merely the form or outward appearance, and if the subject matter in substance is something which is beyond the powers of that legislature to legislate upon, the form in which the law is clothed would not save it from condemnation. The legislature cannot violate the constitutional prohibitions by employing an indirect method. 2. 1954 SCR 1, 12: AIR 1953 SC 375 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Special Deputy Collector, Madras 3 a Constitu- tion Bench of this Court observed that when it is said that legislation is a colourable one, what it means is that the legislature has transgressed its legislative power in a covert or indirect manner, if it adopts a device to outstep the limits of its power. When the constitutional provision stipulates that an ordinance promulgated by the Governor to meet an emergent situation shall cease to be in operation at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of the legislature and the government if it wishes the provisions of the ordinance to be continued in force beyond the period of six weeks has to go before the legislature which is the constitutional authority entrusted with the law-making function, it would most certainly be a colourable exercise of power for the government to ignore the legislature and to repromulgate the ordinance and thus to continue to regulate the life and libel'ty of the citizens through ordinance made by the executive. Such a strategem would be repugnant to the constitutional scheme, as it would enable the executive to transgress its constitutional limitation in the matter of law-making in an emergent situation and to covertly and indirectly arrogate to itself the law-making function of the legislature. 8. Shri Lal Narain Sinha, appearing on behalf of the State of Bihar urged that the court is not entitled to examine whether the conditions precedent for the exercise of the power of the Governor under Article 213 existed or not, for the purpose of determining the validity of an ordinance and in support of this proposition, he strongly relied upon the decisions reported in Bhagat Singh v. Empire, 4 Raja Bahadur Kamakshya Narain Singh v. CIT 6 , Lakshmidhar Misra v. Rangalal8 and R.C. Cooper v. Union of India. 7 \\Ve do not see how these decisions could possibly help in the present case. They do not at all deal with the question which we are called upon to decide here. It is true that, according to the decisions of the Privy Council and this Court, the court cannot examine the question of satisfaction of the Governor in issuing an ordinance, but the question in the present case does not raise any controversy in regard to the satisfaction of the Governor. The only question is whether the Governor has power to repromulgate the same ordinance successively without bringing it before the legislature. That clearly the Governor cannot do. He cannot assume legislative function in excess of the strictly defined limits set out in the Constitution because otherwise he would be usurping a function which does not belong to him. It is significant to note that so far as the President of India is concerned, though he has the same power of issuing an ordinance under Article l 23 as the Governor has under Article 213, there is not a single instance in which the President has, since 1950 till today, repromulgated any ordinance after 3.

This is clearly contrary to the constitu- tional scheme and it must be held to be improper and invalid. We hope and trust that such practice shall not be continued in the future and that whenever an ordinance is made and the government wishes to continue the provisions of the ordinance in force after the assembling of the legislature, a Bill will be brought before the legislature for enacting those provisions into an Act.
