In prosecutions for offences arising out of Jae• lion, where the Crown witnesses belong to the party hostile to accused, their evidence ,.equires ve,-y careful scrutiny. The Police Sub·Inspecto1' held an inquest on the body of the murdered man and examined some witnesses and wf'ote down thefr state- ments in his note book. After the conclusion of the inquest the Circle Inspector took over the investigatfon ff'om the Police Sub Ins· pecto1' and on the same day he examined all the witnesses including all the witnesses who had been examined by the Police Sub· I nsPtcior and their statements were record· ed in the case diary prepared by the Circle Inspector. The notes of the examinatfon b:,, the Circle Inspector were made available to the accused at the earliest opportunity but the note book of the Police Sub Inspector was produc,;,d towards the end of the prose- cution case when the police Sub Inspector was in the witness box. Held, that there was a breach of the proviso to S. 162, Cr.P,C. in that the entries in the Police Sub Inspector's note book u:ere not made · avai'lable to the accused, as they should have been, for the cross-examination of the ·-witnesses for the Cr<Jwn. But that in the peculiar circumstances of the case, since the statements of the witness were made available, though too late to be effective, and as no point was made of any inco1isiste,icy between the statemtnts made to the Polz'.ce Sub Inspector and those made later in the day to the Circle Inspector, no prejudice was occasioned to the accused by the failure lo produce in - proper time the note book of the Police Sub-Inspector; ar,d that the trial was valid notwithstanding the breach of S, 162, such breacn being curtd by S. 537. The right given to an accused person by S. hi2 Cr. P. C. is a very valuable one and often provides important material for cross exa· mination of the prosecution witnesses.

JV:inor in-consistencies in his sr:veral statements may not embarass a truthful ·wi\"tness, but may cause an un· ttuthful wif1less to prevaricate, and ma~ lead to the ultimate breakdown of the whole of his evidence. Where the statements artJ never made available to the accused, an in· ference, which is almost irresistible, arises of prejudice to the accused. The contention that S. 537, Cr. P. C. can.not cure a breach of a direct and important Provision of the Code of Criminal Procedi,r• is b-rsed on too narrow a vif!.•w of the opera• tion of S. 537. ll'hen a trial is condttcfed in a manner different from that prescribed by the Code, the trfrtl is bad and no question of curing an irregularity arises, but if the trial is cond1tcted substantially in the man· ner prescribed by the Code, but some irregu· lart'.iy occurs in the course of such conduct, tTu, irregularity can be cured under S. 53'1 and none the less so because the frrep_ularUy invol1.,es, as must 1 early al·ways be the case, a breach of o,ie or more of the very compre· hensive prov£sions of the Code.

JUDGMENT SrR JOHN BEAUMONT ~ This is an appeal ' by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Madras, dated 22nd October, 1945, dismiss- ing an appeal agait1st the judgment and order of the Com t of Sessions, Guntur Divi· sion, dated the 2nd August, 1945, whereby the appellants, who-were accused Nos. 1 to 9 and nine others, were found guilty on charges of rioting and murder. Appellants I, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 were sentenced to death, and appellants Nos, 3 to 9 were se11tenced to transportation for life. There were other lesser concurrent sentences which 11eed not be noticed. At the conclusion of the argu- ments their Lordships announced the advice which they would humbly tender to His Majesty, and they now give their reasons for that advice. The offence charged was of a type common in many parts of India in which there are factions in a village, and tbe members of one faction are assaulted by members of the other faction, and, in the prosecution which results, the Crown witnesses belong to the party hostile _to the accused; which involves that their evidence ,requires very careful scrutiny. In the present case the assessors were not prepared to accept the prosecution evidence, but tbe lea1 ned Sessions Judge, whilst takillg careful note of the fact that the six eye·witn-esses were all hostile to the accused. nevertheless considered tha·t tbe story which they told was substantially trtte and accordingly he convicted the _accused. As already noted, this decision was upheld by the High Court in appeal. The grounds upon wh:ch leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council was granted were two:- 1. The failure of the prosecution to supply the defence at the proper titne with copies of statements which hall hee11 made by important prosecution wit- nesses during the course of the preliminary police investigation fovolving, it is alleged a breach of th_e exprei:s provisions of section 162 of the Code of Cn. minal Procedure, 2, The alleged wrongful admission and use In evidence of confessions alleged to have been made whilst in police custody hy appellants Nos. 3 and 6. This point -involves an impo1 tant question as to the construction of Section 27 of th e ItJdian Evidence Act upon which the opinions of High Co~irts in India are in conflict, Their Lordships w!ll deal first with the alleged infringement of Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure . The relevant portions of that section are as follows:- •· 162. (1) No statement made by any person to a police-officer in the.course of 1!1l inves_ti_gation 1;1nder this Chapter shall, 1f rer!ttcf'd into wntrng, be signed by the person making it ; nor t:hall any. such st~te- ment or any r ecord thereof, whetbeT 1n a !)ohce- di11ry or otherwise, or any part. of such staten3ent or record, be used . for any purpose (save as hereinafter provided) at any inquiry or trfal in respect of ·any offence under investigAtiott at the time when such sh1teme11t was -maae: Provided that, when any witness is called for the prosecution in such foquiry or trial whose statement has been redt1ced into writing !IS Aforesnirl, the conrt shall on the request of the accused, refer to.such writfo g and direct t11at the nccused be funushed with a copy thereof, in orr!er tlrnt iiny part o_f such statement, H duly proved, may be 1.1sed to con- tradict such witness in the manner provirlen by sec• tiot1 145 of the Inilian Evidence Act, 18i2. ,vhen any part of such statement is so 11se<l, any part thereof may Also he used in the re-examination of. sucl1 wit- ness. hut for the pprpose 0111,v of explAioing any matter referred to in his cross· examination,•• , The facts material upon this part of the c.ase are these.

Ltd. ~(!;<D® IONLINEf True Prinf recorded in the Case Diary prepared by the Chcle Inspector. It is the failure to produce the note-book of the police sub-Inspector which constitutes the alleged infringement of the proviso to Section 162, and the facts as to this are stated in an affidavit of Gutlapally Venkata Appayya sworn on the -19th.October, 1945, and are not challeng• ed. Prior to the commencement of the pre· liminary inquiry before the Magistrate an application was made on behalf of the ac· cused for grant of copies of statements under Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Proce· d ure recorded by the sub-Inspector and the Circle Inspector of Police from the prosecu- tion witnesses in the case during investiga- tion. The accused were supplied with copies of statements made by witnesses before the Circle Inspector of Police and were informed that statements made to the sub-Inspector of Police were not available. During the Ses- sions trial, when prosecution witness No. 2, who was the principal prosecution witness, was in the witness box, Counsel for the accused represented to the Court that be bad not been supplied with copies of statements recorded by the sub Inspector at the first inquest, and requested the Court to make those statements available to enable him to cross-examine the important prosecution witnesses with reference lo the earliest statements. The learned Sessions Judge directed the Public Prosecutor to comply with the request. The Public· Prosecutor, after consulting the sub-Inspector and Circle Inspector, who were present in Court, sub- mitted to the Court that except what was recorded in the inquest report itself, no other statements were recorded by the sub-Inspec- tor, and the learned Judge directed the de- fence Counsel to proceed. The next day, when the cross-examination of prosecution witness 2 was continued, Counsel for the accused submitted to the Court that he desi- red to file an application for copies of stale• ments recorded by the sub-Inspector at the first inquest so : hat it might be endorsed by the prosecution that no such record of state· ments existed. Then the public prosecutor stated to the Cuurt Lhat he fully realized his reponsibility in making the statements be had made on the previous day; -bn t there was no record of a11y sta\"t:emen t made at the i11quc3t available. On the fourth day of the trial, atfer the principal prosecntion 1,vitnesses had hee-a discharged, the police suh lnspec tor gave evidence, a.nd he then prodnced in the witness-box his note·book contai11· ing the statements of the five witnesses he had examined at the - inquest, and a copy of such statements was then supplied to the accused. There are some discrepancies - between the .statements made to the police sub-Inspector and the statements of the wit· nesses in the witness·bo.x. but His not sug· gested that such discrepancies are of a vital nature. It is clear from the facts narrated above that there was a breach of the proviso to Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Proce- dure, and that the entries in the polic<\" sub· Inspedor's note-book were not made available to the accused, as they should have bee:n, for the cross-examination of the witnesses _for the Crown. 'l'he right given to an ac· cused person by this section is a very valu· able one and often provides important material for cross-examination of the prose• cution witnesses. However slender the material for cross-examination may 1,eem to be, it is difficult to gauge its possible effect. Minor inconsistenci~s in his several state• menls may not embarrass a truthful witness, but niay cause an untruthful witness to prevaricate, and may lead to the ultimate break-d )Wn of the whole of bis evidence: and in the present case it has to be remember- ed that the accuseds' contention was that the prosecution witnes!-.es were false witnes· ses. Courts in India have always regarded any breach of the proviso to Section 162 as matter of gravity. Balfram v. King Bmpe,-o,- [I] where the record of statements made by witness€s had been de:,ti:oyed, and Emperor v. Ba11sidhar and others [2] where tl1e court had refused to supply to the accused copies of statei:uents made by witnesses to the police, afford instances in which failure to comply with the provisions of section 162 have led to the convictions being quashed. Their Lordships would, however, obsene that where, as in those two cases, the stat'e• ments were never made available to the ac· cused, an inference, which is almost irresistible, arises of prejudice to the: ac· cused. In the present case, the statements of the witnesses were made available though too la.te to be t-fft~ctive, aud their contents are known. 'l'his by itself mi'ght not be decisive, but, 4S already noted, tbe Circle Inspector re •f.xami1:ed t be witnesses whom th e polic<' sub-inspectc,r had examined, and did so on t 11e s;i.nu: d;:i.y.

If any such inconsistency bad been discovered, this would have been a strong point for the ac- cused in their appeal, but no such point was taken; indeed, the only complaint upon this subject in the High Court was that the police sub-Inspector ought to be presumed to have prepared a Case Diary which be was suppres- sing. The High Court re.iected this con ten- tion, rightly as their Lordships think. Nor has any such point been taken before this Board, and the <:ntt'ies from the Circle In~- pector's diary are not on record. In the resuft their Lordships are satisfied that, in the . peculiat circumstances of this case, no pre- judice was occasioned to the accused by the . failure to produce in proper time the note- book of the police sub Inspector. Even on this basis, Mr.~Pritt for the accu- sed has argued that a breach of a direct and important provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be cured, but must lead to the quashing of the conviction. The Crown, on the other hand, contends that the failure to produce the note-book in question amoun- ted merely to an irregularity in the proceed- ings which can be cured under the provisions of Section 537 of the Code of Criminal Proce• dure if the Court is satisfied that such irre- gularity has not in fact occasioned any failure of justice. There ale, no doubt, authorities in India which lend some support to Mr. Pritt's contention, and reference may be made to Tirkha and anor v. Nanak and anor [3] 'in which tbe Court expressed the view that Section 537 of the Code of Crimi· nal Procedure applied only to errors of proce- dure arising out of mere inadvertence, and not to cases of disregard of, or disobedience to,· mandatory provisions of the Code, and to In re Madura Muthu V atmian [ 4] h1 which the view was e.xpressed that any failure to examine the accused under S 34?. of the Code of Criminal 1-'rocedure was fatal to the validi ty of the t_rial ~,.,.,d r: ;u l<l n o t be cured uud-c:r S. 537.

Subramania lyer's Case [5]), th~ trial is bad, and no question of curing an irregularity arises,· but if the trial is con, ducted substantially in the manner prescrib- ed by the Code, but some irregularity occurs in the course of such conduct, the irr_egularity can be cured under S. 537, and none the less so ~ecause the irregularily involves, as must nearly always be the case, a breach of one or more of the very comprehensive provisions of the Code . The distinction drawn in many of the cases in India between an illegality and an irregularity is one of degree rather than of kind. This view finds support in the decision of their Lordships' Board in Abdul Rahman v The King Emperor [6], where failure to comply with Section 360 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was held to be cured by Sections 535 and 537. The present case falls under Section 537 and their Lordships hold the trial valid notwith· standing the breach of Section 162 • The second question, which involves the construction of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, will now be considered. That section and the two preceding sections, with which it must be read, are in these terms:- .. 25. No confession mane to a Police officer, shall be proved as against a person accused of ony offence . \" 26 No confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of R Police officer. unless it be made 1 in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved a& ag11.inst such person.\" The explanation to the section is not relevant. ' '27 Provided tliat when any fact is depo&ed to as discovered in co11scquence of information received from a person accused of any offence in the cuatody of a Police officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not. as relates distinctly to the fnct thereby discovered, may be pr0ved . '' Section 27, which is not artistically word• ed, provides an exception to the prohibition imposed by the preceding section, and en- ables certain statements made by a person in police custody to be proved. Tlte condition necessary to bri11g the section into operation is that the discovery of a fact in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence in the custody of a Police officer must 0e deposed to, and thereupon so m u ch of the information_as relat •2s distinctly to t:1e fact thereby discovere d m c,.y l c proved.

Normally the section is brought into operation when a person in police cus- tody produces from some place of conceal- ment some object, such as a dead body, a weapon, or ornaments, said lo b~ connecte_d with the crime of which the 111formant 1s accused. 'Mr. Megaw, for the Crown, has argued that in such a case the \"fact tlisco· vered\" is the physical object produced, and that any information which relates distinct:y to that object can be proved. Upon this view information given by a person that the body produced is that of a person murdered by him, that the weapon produced is the one used by him in the commission of a murder, or that the ornaments produced were stolen in a dacoity would all be admissible. If this be the effect of section 27, little substance would remain in the ban imposed by the two preceding sections on confessions made to the police, or by persons in police cus- tody. That ban was presumably inspired by the fear of the legislature that a person under police influence might be induced to confess by the exercise of undue pressure. But if all that is required to lift the ban be the inclusion in the confession of informa- tion relating to an object subsequently pro· duced, it seems reasonabl.e to suppose that the persuasive powers of the poiice will pr~·ve equal to the occasion, and that in pract:ce the ban will lose its effect. On normal pnn· ciples of construction their Lordships think that the proviso to section 26, added . by section 27, should not be held to nullify · the substance of the section. In their Lord· ships' view it is fallacious to treat th_e \"fact discovered\" within the section as equivalent to the object produced; the fact discovered embraces the place from which the object is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this, and the information given m:ist relate distinctly to this . fact. Information as to past user, or the past hist ory, of the object produced is not related to its disco· very ln the setting in which it is discOVf'.':red. Informat ion supplied by a person in <..us tody that ''I will produce a knife con cealed in the roof of my house\" does not lead to tbe dis· covery of a knife; knives w-:re discovered µia:ny years ago. It leads to the discovery of 49 the fact that a knife is concealed in the house ·of the informant to his knowledge, and if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission of the offence, the fact - discovered is very relevant. But if to the statement the words · be added \"with which I stabbed A\" these words are inadmissible since they do not relate to the discovery of the knife in the house of the informent. · High Cou:-ts in India have generally taken the view as to the meaning of Section 27 which appeals to their Lordships, and refer· ence may be made particularly to Sukhan v. T'ie Crown [7] and Ganuchandra Kashid v. Emperor [8] on which the appellants rely, and with which their Lordships are in agree· ment. A contrary view has, however been taken by the Madras High Court, and the question was discussed at length in a Full Bench decision of that Court in re Athappa Goundan [9] where the cases were referred to. The Court, whilst admitting that the weight of Indian authority was agains.t them, nevertheles.; took the view that any information which served to connect the object discovered with the offence cha.rged was admissib1e under section 27. lu that case the Court bad to deal with a confes• sion of murder made by a person in police custody, and the Court admitted the c~n- fession because in the. last sentence (readily separable from the rest) there was an offer to produce two bottles, a rope, and a cloth gag, which, according to the confession had been used in, or were connected with, the commission of the murder, anq. the objects were in fact produced, The Court was impressed with the consideration that as the objects produced were not in themselves of an incriminating nature their production would be irrelevant unless they were shown to be connected with the mur- der and there was no evidence so to con- nec't them apart from the confession. Their Lordships are unable to accept this reasott• ing. The difficulty, however great, of pro• ving that a fact discovered on information supplied by the accused is a relevant fact can afford no justification for reading into section 27 s0mething which is not there, and admitting in evi1 ence a confession barred by section 26.

The pos1ti0n therefore is that in this case evi<len~e has been admitted which ought 11ot to have been admitted, and the duty of the Court in such circumsta11ces is stated in Sec• tion 167 of the Indian Evidence Act which · provides: \"The improper admission or rejec· tion of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case, if it shall appear to the Court before which such objection is raised that, indepen· dently of the evidence objected to and admit• ted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied:tbe decision.\" It was therefore the duty of the High Court in appeal to apply its mind to the question whether, after discard~ ing the evidence improperly admitted, there was left sufficient to justify the convictions. 'l'he Judges of the High Court did not apply their minds to this question because they considered that the evidence was properly admitted, and their Lordships propose there• fore to remit the case to the High Court of Madras, with directions to consider this question. If the Court is satisfied that there is sufficient admissible evidence to justify the convictions they will uphold them. If, on the other hand, they consider that the admissible evidence is not :·su'fficient to justify the convictions, they will take such course, whether by discharging the accused or by ordering a new trial, as may be open to them. · Their Lordships have, therefore, humbly advised His Majesty that this appeal be al· lowed and that the case be remitted to the Higb Court of Madras, witll directions to consider · whether the evidence on record apart from the confessional statements of accused No. 3 and accused No. 6 which their Lordships have held to be i11a.dmissible, is sufficient to justify the convictions and to make such order in the matter as may te right having regard to their decision upon the question remitted to tbem.
