The appellants in the present appeal (who were the petitioners before the learned Single Judge) are Mr. Ashwani Minda [hereinafter referred to as \"AM\"] and 3. The basic agreement to which the present disputes relate is a Joint Venture Agreement dated 30.05.1986 [hereinafter referred to as \"the JVA\"], to which USL 4. The details of the arrangement between the parties were set out in the JVA including the organisation of equity capital (clause 2.4), the option of USL to “4-1 Neither YUHSHIN nor JAY shall sell the shares of New Co to any xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx ASHWANI MINDA v. M/S. U-SHIN LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES290 2020 4 if initiated by YUHSHIN, or under the Rules of the Japan Commercial xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx\" 5. The case of the appellants is that the interest of the partnership firm in the JVA was transferred to JPM and AM by virtue of a Memorandum of Family 6. JUL went public in 1989 and 43.7% of its shareholding is at present held by parties other than AM and USL. AM and USL in turn hold 30.3% and 26% of the 7. The dispute between the parties arises out of a transaction for mutual business integration between USL and MMI, which was announced on 07.11.2018. 8. The contention of the appellants is that the proposed public offer in fact constitutes a breach of the provisions of the JVA, particularly clauses 4.1 and 7.1 9. By a communication dated 13.03.2020, the appellants applied before the JCAA for an emergency measure of protection under Articles 75 to 79 of the JCAA “82. Claimants seeks the following interim reliefs against Respondents (a) to restrain Respondents from pursuing any actions or steps with respect, and in relation, to the open offer to purchase shares, in Vol. CCLXXI 291ASHWANI MINDA v.

By an order dated 02.04.2020, the emergency arbitrator rejected the request, holding against the appellants both on the question of jurisdiction andinter alia held that he did not have jurisdiction in respect of claims under the LTAA, that JUL (being the joint venture company) could 11. During the pendency of the emergency arbitration proceedings, the appellants submitted 'a request for arbitration' dated 23.03.2020 to the JCAA. The “20. As final reliefs, Claimants seek the following against Respondents (a) An award of declaration that Respondents breached clauses 4.1 and 7.1 of JVA and clauses 1.1 and 26.1 of LTAA. (b) An award of damages in respect of Respondents' breach of clauses 4.1 and 7.1 of JVA and clauses 1.1 and 26.1 of LTAA: for Respondent DELHI LAW TIMES292 2020 6 No. 1, in effect, breaches the JVA such that the proprietary interest (c) An award of mandatory injunction against Respondents to transfer to Claimant No. 1 such percentage of its 26% voting share capital in (d) In the alternative to \"c,\" an award of mandatory injunction against Respondents to transfer to Claimant No. 1 the shares acquired via (e) In the alternative to \"c\" and \"d,\" and without prejudice any of the above reliefs, an award of damages.

In the request for arbitration, the appellants also sought various interim reliefs, substantially similar to the reliefs sought in the application before the 13. It is undisputed that the arbitral tribunal has since been constituted under the aegis of the JCAA on 13.05.2020. 14. Prior to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, the appellants moved the petition under Section 9 of the Act [OMP (I) (COMM.) No. 90/2020] before the Vol. CCLXXI 293ASHWANI MINDA v. M/S. U-SHIN LTD. 7 15. The learned Single Judge dismissed the petition on the grounds of maintainability, finding that the petition could not be maintained after dismissal of 16. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 12.05.2020, the appellants have preferred this appeal. 17. Before adverting to the submissions of the parties, the relevant provisions of the Act are set out below: “2. Definitions— xxxx xxxx xxxxThis Part shall apply where the place of arbitration is in India: [Provided that subject to an agreement to the contrary, the provisions of, 27 and clause (a) of Sub-section (1) and Sub-section (3) of Section 37 shall also apply to international commercial arbitration, even if the place of arbitration is outside India, and an arbitral award made or to be made in such place is enforceable and recognised under the xxxx xxxx xxxxInterim measures, etc., by Court.—[(1)] A party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the follow- ing matters, namely: (a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, DELHI LAW TIMES294 2020 8 (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient, and the Court shall have the xxxx xxxx xxxxOnce the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain an application under Sub-section (1), unless the Court finds that circumstances xxxx xxxx xxxxInterim measures ordered by arbitral tribunal.—(1) A party may, during the arbitral proceedings, apply to the arbitral tribunal— xxxx xxxx xxxx any order issued by the arbitral tribunal under this Section shall be deemed to be an order (5 of 1908), in the same manner as if it were an order of the Court.” (Emphasis supplied) It may be noted that the proviso to Section 2(2) of the Act, and Section 9(3) were both 18. It would also be convenient at this stage to set out the relevant provisions of the JCAA Rules, which are as follows: “Article 71 Interim Measures 1. A party may apply in writing to the arbitral tribunal for the grant of interim measures against the other Party (\"Interim Measures\"). Interim Measures are, for example, orders to: (1) maintain or restore the status quo; (2) take action that would prevent, or refrain from taking action that is likely to cause, current or imminent harm or prejudice to the arbitral (3) provide a means of preserving assets out of which a subsequent arbitral award may be satisfied; or (4) preserve evidence that may be relevant and material to the resolu- tion of the dispute. 2. The Party requesting Interim Measures under Article 71.1(1), (2) and (3) (1) harm not adequately reparable by an arbitral award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substan- Vol. CCLXXI 295ASHWANI MINDA v.

Singh, learned Counsel for the appellants, submitted that the impugned judgment overlooks the purpose behind the proviso to Section 2(2) of the 20. According to Mr. Singh, therefore, the only question to be determined in the present case concerns the scope of Section 2(2) of the Act, and more particularly, Vol. CCLXXI 297ASHWANI MINDA v. M/S. U-SHIN LTD. 11 i.e. that Part I would be applicable in the absence of an agreement to the contrary. He further submitted that Article 15 of the Japanese Arbitration Act, 2003 permitsHeligo Charters Private Limited v.

Relying upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Transcore v. Union of India, (2008) 1 SCC 125 and the Division Bench decision of the Calcutta High Court in Mussammat Gulab Koer v. Badshah Bahadur (Minor), (1908-09) 13 CWN 1197 : 1909 SCC OnLine Cal 143, Mr. Singh further argued that the \"doctrine of election\"Raffles Design Int'l India Pvt. Ltd. v. Educomp Professional Education Ltd. & Ors., 234 (2016) DLT 349 permits an independent adjudication in a petition under Section 9 of the Act, notwithstand-Raffles Design (supra) has been erroneously distinguished in the impugned judgment. 22. Mr. Singh submitted that in the facts of the present case, where the interim relief sought by the appellants concerns a public offer to be made in India in the 23. Mr. K.V.

Mr. Viswanathan further pointed out that the appellants' pleadings, in the petition under Section 9 of the Act, make it clear that they approached this Court 26. Although the impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge is confined to the question of maintainability, we also heard both sides briefly on the merits of 27. Mr. Singh argued that the proposed public offer by MMI would result in acquisition of a majority shareholding in JUL by MMI, entirely contrary to theGujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. & Ors. v. Coca Cola Co. & Ors., 1995 (SLT SOFT) 406=(1995) 5 SCC 545. Relying upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in State of Rajasthan and Ors. v. Gotan Lime Stone Khanij Udyog Private Limited & Anr., I (2016) SLT 450=(2016) 4 SCC 469, Mr. Singh contended that the transaction between USL and MMI in fact 28. Mr. Viswanathan, on the contrary, reiterated the findings of the emer- gency arbitrator to the effect that there has been no transfer of shares of JUL as a vide communication dated 17.04.2019. According to Mr. Viswanathan, MMI is legally mandated to make 29. Mr. Viswanathan also argued that the arbitration proceedings as consti- tuted are misconceived for misjoinder of parties, which point has inter alia been raised before the arbitral tribunal as a jurisdictional objection. He submitted that 30. Mr. Singh, in rejoinder, argued that the appellants' communication dated 17.04.2019 cannot constitute acquiescence or waiver in any respect, as the integra- Vol. CCLXXI 299ASHWANI MINDA v. M/S.

Narayanan Mussad, ILR 1889 (12) Mad 320 and of the Oudh Chief Commissioner's Court in Ram Avadh Pande v.

With regard to the locus of AM in the arbitration proceedings, Mr. Singh submitted that the Family Settlement Deed dated 12.05.2019, to which JPM and AMP.K. Mohan Ram v. B.N.

In the light of the facts and submissions recorded above, the primary question which requires consideration is whether the appellants ought to be 33. Although Section 9(3) of the Act is, on its terms, expressly relatable to India-seated arbitrations, as evidenced by the reference to Section 17 of the Act, we “[Note: This amendment seeks to reduce the role of the Court in relation to grant of interim measures once the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted. After all, This also appears to be the spirit of the UNCITRAL Model Law as amended in 2006. (Emphasis supplied) 34. Mr. Singh submitted on behalf of the appellants that the aforesaid principle is not applicable to foreign-seated arbitrations, as interim measures DELHI LAW TIMES300 2020 14 pointed to this very difference as the rationale for the insertion of the proviso toBharat Alu- minium and Co. v. Kaiser Aluminium and Co., VII (2012) SLT 71=(2012) 9 SCC 552, and observed as follows: “41. While the decision in BALCO is a step in the right direction and would (i) Where the assets of a party are located in India, and there is a likelihood that that party will dissipate its assets in the near future, (ii) While the decision in BALCO was made prospective to ensure that hotly negotiated bargains are not overturned overnight, it results in 35. We are unable to accept Mr. Singh's contention. The primary purpose of Part I of the Act (which inter alia includes Section 2, 9 and 17) is to govern India- seated arbitrations. The reference in Section 9(3) to Section 17 alone, cannot Vol. CCLXXI 301ASHWANI MINDA v. M/S. U-SHIN LTD. 15 being available in the Indian Courts in connection with foreign-seated arbitrations, 36. In considering the aforesaid question, the Court would certainly have regard to the question as to whether the remedy before the arbitral tribunal would 37. Turning to the facts of the present case, it is undisputed that the arbitral tribunal has in fact been constituted. Articles 71 and 78 of the JCAA Rules,Nagubai Ammal (supra) (paragraph 21).

Since the constitution of the main tribunal is due for near a month's time, the present Application is being filed by the Applicants seeking urgent (Emphasis supplied) Similarly, in paragraph 70 of the petition (at page 512 of the appeal paperbook), it “70. The Hon'ble High Court is not barred from entertaining this Application as the main arbitral tribunal has not been formed under the selected institution. The concluded Emergency Arbitra- tion (\"EA\") proceedings do not weigh in against the Applicants in pursu- ing this Application under Section 9.” (Emphasis supplied) Paragraph 2 of the appellants' written submissions before the learned Single Judge The appellants have not approached this Court because the arbitral tribunal would not be able to render effective orders in their favour, but because the tribunal 39. Turning now to the \"doctrine of election\" invoked in the impugned judgment, Mr. Singh submitted that the said doctrine is applicable only when theTranscore (supra) and the Division Bench decision of Calcutta High Court in Mussammat Gulab (supra) to this effect. 40. However, this contention also does not appeal to us. The aforesaid judgments, considering the doctrine of election as a facet of estoppel, emphasise the Vol. CCLXXI 303ASHWANI MINDA v. M/S. U-SHIN LTD. 17 41. After the amendment of Section 2(2), a party to a foreign-seated arbitration has the option of seeking interim measures of protection in the Indian Courts, or of 42. The appellants' reliance upon the judgment of a learned Single Judge in Raffles Design (supra) is similarly misplaced. The relevant observations in Raffles Design (supra) are as follows: “104. In the circumstances, the emergency award passed by the Arbitral 43. The significant difference between Raffles Design (supra) and the present case is that the emergency arbitrator in Raffles Design (supra) had granted an interim measure in favour of the petitioner therein, which had also been enforced by the DELHI LAW TIMES304 2020 18 44. In view of our findings above, it is not necessary to examine the correctness of the finding of the learned Single Judge in paragraph 54 that the provision of the 45.
