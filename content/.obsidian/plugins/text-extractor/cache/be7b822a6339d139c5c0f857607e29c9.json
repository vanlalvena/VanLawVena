In the present case since the goods were covered by a specific heading i.e. Heading 25.01, the same cannot be classified under the residuary heading at all. This position is clearly laid down in Rule 3(a) of the Interpretative Rules set out above. As per the said Interpretative Rule 3(a), the heading which provides the most specific description shall be pref erred to the heading providing a more general description. This position is also well settled by a number of judgments of this Court. Reference may be made to Bharat Forge and Press Industries (P) Ltd. v. CCE11 . It was observed in para 4 inter alia as under: (SCC p. 534) '4. The question before us is whether the Department is right in claiming that the items in question are dutiable under Tariff Entry 68. This, as mentioned already, is the residuary entry and only such goods as cannot be brought under the various specific entries in the tariff should be attempted to be brought under the residuary entry. In other words, unless the Department can establish that the goods in question can by no conceivable process of reasoning be brought under any of the tariff items, resort cannot be had to the residuary item.' \" ( emphasis in original) 58. In our opinion \"yeast\" is a chemical within the meaning of the entry in question. 59. For the views we have taken, it is not necessary for us to consider the other contentions raised by the parties. 60.

The trial court convicted the appellant on the basis that the reaction of the accused was not natural as he did not exhibit his emotion d or sadness despite the fact that a shocking incident had occurred and that the sniffer dog stayed near the accused. Allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court Held: The circumstantial evidence leading to the guilt of the appellant not having been established by the prosecution, the judgment of the conviction cannot be sustained. The prosecution made an attempt to show that the deaths of the e victims were caused by administration of poison and/or strangulation. The prosecution in a case of commission of murder by poisoning must bring in record some evidence linking the accused therewith. The bottle containing pesticide was found in the washbasin along with a glass inside the house. There is nothing on record to show that the appellant had purchased pesticide or brought it home. No fingerprint of the appellant was taken to show that it was he f who had used the bottle or the glass for the said purpose. No incriminating evidence linking the appellant in regard to administration of poison/pesticide has been brought on record. A finding of guilt cannot be based on a presumption. Before arriving at an inference that the appellant has committed an offence, existence of materials therefor ought to have been found. (Paras 60, 54, 56 and 33) Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v.

It is not the case of the prosecution that the deceased were last seen in the company of the appellant. Nobody had seen him going inside his house or coming out at the time of or nearabout the commission of the crime. The matter might have been different if some evidence had been introduced to suggest that the offence was committed sometime between 11.30 a.m. and 4/5 p.m. and to infer that he could forcibly administer poison to the deceased or strangulate them or to do the both so as to cause their deaths.

The purported absence of any reaction on the part of the appellant in a regard to the death of the two deceased was for all intent and purpose made the sole basis for his conviction by the trial Judge. The conduct of the appellant, so far his initial reaction to the occurrence is concerned, appears to be most natural as he suspected that something was wrong but was unsure thereabout at the same time. In any view of the matter, it does not give rise to an inference which is consistent with the hypothesis of guilt. (Paras 4 7, 51, 31 and 36) An accused person's conduct or reaction (or lack of it) by itself, cannot be a b ground for arriving at a conclusion that he is guilty of commission of crime. Formation of another opinion is also possible. No hard-and-fast rule having any universal application with regard to the reaction of a person in a given circumstance can be laid down. One person may lose equilibrium and balance of mind, but, another may remain a silent spectator till he is able to reconcile himself and then react in his own way. (Paras 49 and 4 7) c Rana Partap v.

He found the same open. 4. He was heard shouting loudly calling the name of his daughter Munni and wife Mala several times. He found his wife and daughter lying dead on separate beds. After a few minutes, the appellant called PW 1 again shouting \"Boruah! Boruah!\". On his query as to what had happened, he asked him to b come and have a look. PW 1 found the wife of the deceased (sic appellant) lying on the bed with her face down. He also saw the lower part of her legs looking pale. His attention was also drawn by the appellant to the corpse of Munni. The leg of the girl was shaken by the appellant stating, \"look, she is also not moving\". The appellant remarked, \"Mala should not have done this\". 5. PW 1, thereafter, asked somebody (whose name has not been c disclosed) to inform the police. As the said request was not complied with, he himself informed the officer in charge of the police station about the incident. 6. For the purpose of investigation, a sniffer dog was brought into service. The dog was taken near the dead bodies. It allegedly went close to the appellant only and no one else when he was inside the house. 7. PW 1, in his deposition before the court opined \"that even though such d a shocking incident had taken place, Borthakur did not show any reaction as he should have\". He, however, in his cross-examination stated: \"Having seen the occurrence, I had lost my senses. He too might have been out of his mind to some extent. Reactions vary with people. As the deceased were the accused person's wife and daughter respectively, his reaction should have been more acute. Reaction of the accused person e that I had noticed might have been for the unexpected turn of event. He was repeatedly going near the dead body of his daughter but not that of his wife.\" 8.

The dead bodies of both Mala and Munni were having ligature marks but the doctor opined that only Munni died of asphyxia. No such opinion was rendered in respect of the death of Mala. b However, the result of the chemical examination showed presence of organophosphorus pesticide, a poison. 25.

C In the instant case, my opinion is/was silent regarding Mala Borthakur whether it was suicidal or homicidal.\" 26.

The purported absence of any reaction on the part of the appellant in regard to the death of the two deceased was for all intent and purpose made the sole basis for his conviction by the learned trial Judge of the offence. It was concluded: \"So, taking the gamut of all the circumstances analysed in paras 19, 24, 25, 31, 33, 37, 38, 43, 46, 47 and 54 above in particular and the case laws mentioned in para 55 above in entirety, I am very much persuaded to presume that it was the present accused Dinesh Borthakur, and none else who had intentionally caused the death of his wife Mala Borthakur and his adopted daughter in a cold-blooded manner to eliminate them from this earth with some motive best known to himself. The evidence on record of this instant case relating to circumstances and conduct of the accused sufficiently and clearly established all the links in the chain of circumstances leading to the guilt of the present accused and no reasonable ground was left for consideration consistent with his innocence.\" ( emphasis supplied) 32. The judgment of the High Court with respect is no different. 33. A finding of guilt cannot be based on a presumption. Before arriving at an inference that the appellant has committed an offence, existence of materials therefor ought to have been found. No motive for committing the crime was identified which, in the facts and circumstances of the case, was relevant. How the links in the chain of the circumstances led to only one conclusion that the appellant and the appellant alone was guilty of commission of the offence has not been spelt out by the learned trial Judge. 34. The courts below did not record any finding on the basis of any material brought on record by the prosecution that the appellant was seen at the place of occurrence of crime between 11.30 a.m. to 4/5 p.m. The least the prosecution, in this behalf, could do was to examine the co-employees of the appellant who had been working in his office to find out as to when he had ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

No witness also deposed in regard to a the mode of his travelling. He had been seen going out of his house for his place of work by the prosecution witnesses. PW 1 found him calling the name of his wife and the adopted daughter for opening of the main door. He went to the backside of the premises only when PW 1 expressed his opinion that they might have been sleeping. 35. The time-lag between the appellant's calling PW 1 for the first time b and the second time was a few minutes. The prosecution did not suggest nor any finding has been arrived at that the offence could have been committed during the said interval. 36. PW 1 on seeing the deceased Mala lying on the bed gathered an impression that the matter was not normal. Further, PW 1 in his evidence states that the accused shook the leg of the child \"Munni\" stating that she was c also not moving. It is the admitted case of the prosecution that the accused had asked PW 1 to come and have a look. PW 1 himself was uncertain as to whether Mala and child Munni were already dead or not. The conduct of the appellant, so far his initial reaction to the occurrence is concerned, appears to be most natural as he suspected that something was wrong but was unsure thereabout at the same time. In any view of the matter, it does not give rise to d an inference which is consistent with the hypothesis of guilt. 37. At this juncture, we may place on record that PW 6, in his evidence, in no uncertain terms, admitted that the scraping of nails taken from the two deceased did not correspond to the scraping of skin taken from the body of the appellant. The prosecution, therefore, did not bring on record any material to show that the deceased had put up any resistance when the e appellant had allegedly tried to commit the crime. Medical evidence brought on record also does not conclusively show that Mala Borthakur suffered a homicidal death as is evident from the autopsy report, which we have noticed hereinbefore. 38. The mainstay of the prosecution case is the evidence of PW 6, PW 8, f PW 9 and PW 13 who testified about the sniffer dog's staying near the accused and the reaction of the accused was not natural as he did not exhibit his emotion or sadness despite the fact that a shocking incident had occurred. 39. So far as the evidence relating to the reaction of sniffer dog is concerned, this Court in Abdul Rajak Murtaja Dafedar v. State of Maharashtra 1 stated the law, thus: (SCC p. 239, para 11) g \"11. . . . There are three objections which are usually advanced against the reception of [the evidence of dog tracking.] First, since it is manifest that the dog cannot go into the box and give his evidence on oath, and consequently submit himself to cross-examination, the dog's human companion must go into the box and report the dog's evidence, and this is clearly hearsay.

Yet again in Gade Lakshmi Mangaraju v. State of A.P. 2 this Court b C d e f g h opined: (SCC p. 206a-c) \"There are inherent frailties in the evidence based on sniffer or tracker dogs. The possibility of an error on the part of the dog or its master is the first among them .... The possibility of a misrepresentation or a wrong inference from the behaviour of the dog could not be ruled out. Last, but not the least, is the fact that from a scientific point of view, there is little knowledge and much uncertainty as to the precise faculties which enable police dogs to track and identify criminals .... Investigating exercises can afford to make attempts or forays with the help of canine faculties but judicial exercise can ill-afford them.\" The law in this behalf, therefore, is settled that while the services of a sniffer dog may be taken for the purpose of investigation, its faculties cannot be taken as evidence for the purpose of establishing the guilt of an accused. 41. Let us now consider another aspect of the matter viz. the so-called abnormal conduct on the part of the appellant. PW 1 was considered to be the star witness by the prosecution. He was in his house up to 11.30 a.m. It can safely be inferred from his deposition that he had come back to his residence much prior to the appellant. He had not noticed any abnormality in the locality. Other witnesses who were the neighbours of the appellant and/or the shop owners who have their shops on the other side of the road were also not aware of any incident before the appellant reached his residence. 42. PW 1 and PW 2, in their deposition, did not notice any unusual conduct on the part of the appellant or the deceased Mala on that day. 43. The only unusual thing noticed by PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 was the abnormal crying of Munni in the morning for a long time. Something, therefore, must have happened between the mother and the daughter. It is difficult to believe that a six-year-old girl would cry so loudly and that too for such a long span of time so as to draw the attention of the neighbours only because the mother was giving her a bath. Something, therefore, must have happened which the deceased was trying to hide. 44. We fail to see any abnormality in the initial reaction of the appellant. He knocked at the door vigorously. He called the deceased in a loud voice which attracted the attention of PW 1. On a query made by the latter, he had stated that they had not been opening the door and only when PW 1 opined that they must have been sleeping, he went to the rear side of the premises and discovered the dead bodies lying on the bed and again without any loss of time called PW 1. 45. PW 1, in his cross-examination, admitted that reactions vary from person to person. Absence of any exhibition of sadness on the part of the appellant, according to PW 1, was not the conduct of a normal human being. Manjuri Borthakur's evidence, however, is otherwise. 2 (2001) 6 sec 20s : 2001 sec (Cri) 10s2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 708 SUPREME COURT CASES c2008) 5 sec 46. We may notice that this Court in Rana Partap v. State of Haryana 3 in opined: (SCC p. 330, para 6) \"6. Yet another reason given by the learned Sessions Judge to doubt a the presence of the witnesses was that their conduct in not going to the rescue of the deceased when he was in the clutches of the assailants was unnatural. We must say that the comment is most unreal. Every person who witnesses a murder reacts in his own way. Some are stunned, become speechless and stand rooted to the spot. Some become hysteric and start wailing. Some start shouting for help. Others run away to keep b themselves as far removed from the spot as possible. Yet others rush to the rescue of the victim, even going to the extent of counter-attacking the assailants. Every one reacts in his own special way. There is no set rule of natural reaction. To discard the evidence of a witness on the ground that he did not react in any particular manner is to appreciate evidence in a wholly unrealistic and unimaginative way.\" c (See also Marwadi Kishor Parmanand v. State of Gujarat4 and State of U.P. v. Devendra Singh5 .) 47. No hard-and-fast rule having any universal application with regard to the reaction of a person in a given circumstance can, thus, be laid down. One person may lose equilibrium and balance of mind, but, another may remain a d silent spectator till he is able to reconcile himself and then react in his own way. Thus, merely because the appellant did not cry or weep on witnessing the dead bodies of his wife and daughter, cannot be made the basis for informing (sic inferring) his guilt. 48. If he had gone to his office and come back therefrom between 11.30 a.m. till 4/5 p.m., the matter might have been different. If the theory that he e could have committed the murder within a couple of minutes is ruled out, we fail to see on what basis even a suspicion could have been raised that the appellant had committed the crime. It is not the case of the prosecution that the deceased were last seen in the company of the appellant. Nobody had seen him going inside his house or coming out at the time of or nearabout the commission of the crime. The matter might have been different if some f evidence had been introduced to suggest that the offence was committed sometime between 11.30 a.m. and 4/5 p.m. Ordinarily, an accused person after commission of such a ghastly crime would run away from the scene of occurrence but he did not do so. Even if he was to pretend that he did not know about the said occurrence, he could have stayed back in his office waiting for the call of his neighbours about the death of his wife and g daughter. 3 (1983) 3 sec 327 : 1983 sec (Cri) 601 4 (1994) 4 sec 549 : 1994 sec (Cri) 1294 5 (2004) 10 sec 616: 2005 sec (Cri) 582 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

His conduct or reaction ( or lack of it) by itself, thus, cannot be a ground for arriving at a conclusion that he is guilty of commission of crime. a Formation of another opinion is also possible. 50. It may or may not be that the appellant, in the presence of PW 1, told \"Maia should not have done that\". The same by itself does not take us anywhere. Assuming that he did so, although according to the investigating officer, no such statement was made by PW 1 before him, the same merely indicated that something had happened between the mother and the daughter b in the morning which was not to the liking of the appellant. 51. We are surprised to notice the introduction of a story by the prosecution through PW 4. Even if the conduct of the appellant demonstrated that he had been feeling sorry for the death of his daughter and not for his wife, it does not take us any further to arrive at one conclusion or the other. 52. More surprising is the introduction of the purported incriminating c circumstances through some of the prosecution witnesses in regard to the location of the dead bodies and the manner in which things were discovered by some of the prosecution witnesses, although neither the investigating officer had noticed the same nor his attention was drawn thereto by the said witnesses or others. 53. We have noticed heretobefore that the prosecution witnesses did not d make any statement in regard to the purported reaction of the appellant before the investigating officer. 54. The prosecution made an attempt to show that the deaths of the victims were caused by administration of poison and/or strangulation. The bottle containing pesticide was found in the washbasin along with a glass inside the house. There is nothing on record to show that the appellant had e purchased pesticide or brought it home. No fingerprint of the appellant was taken to show that it was he who had used the bottle or the glass for the said purpose. No incriminating evidence linking the appellant in regard to administration of poison/pesticide has been brought on record. 55. In Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra6 this Court opined that before arriving at the finding as regards the guilt of the appellant, f the following circumstances must be established: (SCC p. 185, para 153) g h (i) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established; (ii) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty; (iii) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature; (iv) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with innocence of the accused on preponderance of probability. 56. In that case, it was categorically held that the prosecution in a case of commission of murder by poisoning must bring in record some evidence 6 (1984) 4 sec 116: 1984 sec (Cri) 487 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In the instant case, while two ingredients have been proved but a two have not. In the first place, it has no doubt been proved that Manju died of potassium cyanide and secondly, it has also been proved that there was an opportunity to administer the poison. It has, however, not been proved by any evidence that the appellant had the poison in his possession.\" 57. It was furthermore observed: (Sharad Birdhichand Sarda case6 , SCC b p. 193, para 176) \"176 . ... (2) That, at any rate, the evidence clearly shows that two views are possible - one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other leading to his innocence. It may be very likely that the appellant may have administered the poison (potassium cyanide) to Man ju but at the same time a fair possibility that she herself committed suicide cannot c be safely excluded or eliminated. Hence, on this ground alone the appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt resulting in his acquittal. (3) The prosecution has miserably failed to prove one of the most essential ingredients of a case of death caused by administration of poison i.e. possession of poison with the accused (either by direct or circumstantial evidence) and on this ground alone the prosecution must d fail.\" 58. The first information report might have been lodged by the appellant only when the police arrived at the scene of occurrence. The investigating officer came to the place of occurrence at about 4.45 p.m. PW 1 categorically stated that he had asked someone to inform the police. When he did not comply therewith, then only he did so. If, in the aforementioned situation, the e appellant had not informed the officer in charge of the police station, no presumption of adverse inference could be raised against him. There was no delay on the part of the appellant in informing the police, particularly when he had informed PW 1 who, in turn, informed the police. 59. The learned trial Judge has also relied upon the evidence of PW 10, the owner of a pan shop, who testified that the appellant had not visited the f pan shop on that day. His evidence, in our opinion, is not at all reliable. He admitted in his cross-examination that in the forenoon, his brother used to sit at the shop and, thus, his inference that the appellant used to take pan regularly cannot be trustworthy. 60. We, therefore, are of the firm view that circumstantial evidence leading to the guilt of the appellant has not been established by the g prosecution, the judgment of the conviction and sentence, therefore, cannot be sustained. They are set aside accordingly. We can only record our distress that even in a case of this nature, the appellant had to remain in custody for a period of four years. 61. The appeal is allowed. The appellant is directed to be set at liberty forthwith unless wanted in connection with any other case. h","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
