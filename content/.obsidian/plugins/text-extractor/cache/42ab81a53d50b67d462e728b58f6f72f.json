So, it is obvious that not only the fardbeyan was prepared; rather the entries were made in the station diary also at the police station and a subsequently after taking over the charge from the first 10 (PW 7), PW 8 also took up further investigation on 28-6-1980. It is, therefore, clear that the investigation was promptly taken up and the investigation promptly proceeded with. It is also significant to note that PW 8 happened to be the officer in charge of the police station and it was his duty to send the FIR to court, but as he had proceeded for the place of occurrence on 28th b and he remained there till 29-6-1980, as stated by him, the FIR could not be dispatched in time. In this view of the matter, simply because the FIR in this case was received in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate with delay it cannot be said that the FIR in this case is not genuine or that it is tainted or that the prosecution case should be viewed with suspicion.\" c 16. As noticed above, the statutory obligation warrants utmost promptitude and in the event of the delay not being an unreasonable one and in the event of availability of some explanation therefor, which is otherwise acceptable as well, question of prosecution being tainted would not arise.

RAVINDRA 369 court of its pre-amendment power to award interest on pre-suit interest adjudged as such and not of the power to award future interest on the principal sum adjudged The present cases came up before the Constitution Bench on reference from a three-Judge Bench [(1996) 5 sec 279]. The common question of law arising in all these cases related to the meaning of the phrases \"the principal sum adjudged\" and \"such principal sum\", occurring in Section 34 of CPC, 1908 as amended by Act 66 of 1956. The appellant Bank sanctioned a loan to the respondent, who executed a demand promissory note for Rs 1,37,720. The loan carried interest at the rate of 11 % per annum with quarterly rests. Later, the appellant filed a suit for recovery of the total outstanding amount of Rs 1,51,825 including the interest charged. The High Court while upholding the trial court's decree for Rs 1,51,825 allowed pendente lite and future interest @ 11 % only on Rs 99,000 which was stated to be the principal sum. The appellant Bank was aggrieved by the High Court's decree to the extent future interest was not allowed on the entire amount of Rs 1,51,825. The Solicitor-General contended that the contract between the parties or an established bank practice (in the case of banking transactions) may provide for compounding of the interest on periodical rests and capitalising thereof with the principal, in which event, the amount debited in the account of the borrower shall shed its character as interest and become the principal and therefore shall have to be adjudged as \"the principal sum\" on the date of the suit. He added that once that was done, \"the principal sum adjudged\" shall be \"such principal sum\" for the purpose of interest pendente lite as also future interest. On the other hand, the debtors submitted that the acceptance of such a contention would defeat the legislative intent behind the amendment as it would mean the court awarding interest on interest. They added that notwithstanding the capitalisation of the interest, once the suit is filed and the matter enters the domain of the court under Section 34 CPC, nothing prevents the court from unscrambling the amalgam so as to sieve out the principal from interest and confine the award of interest pendente lite and post- decree to principal sum only. Deciding the question of law and leaving the individual cases to be decided by the appropriate Bench, the Constitution Bench Held: English decisions and decisions of the Supreme Court and almost all the High Courts have noticed and approved the long-established banking practice of charging interest at reasonable rates on periodical rests and capitalising the same on remaining unpaid. Such a practice is prevalent and also recognised in non- banking moneylending transactions. The legislature has stepped in from time to time to relieve the debtors from hardship whenever it has found this practice to be oppressive and needing to be curbed. The practice is permissible, legal and has been judicially upheld except when superseded by legislation. There is nothing wrong in the parties voluntarily entering into transactions, evidenced by deeds incorporating covenant or stipulation for payment of compound interest at reasonable rates, and authorising the creditor to capitalise the interest on the amount remaining unpaid so as to enable interest being charged at the agreed rate on the interest component of the capitalised sum for the succeeding period. Interest once capitalised, sheds its colour of being interest and becomes a part of principal so as to bind the debtor/borrower. (Paras 36 and 44) Reddie v.

Thus, while liability to pay interest is founded on the doctrine of compensation, penal interest is a penalty founded on the doctrine of penal action. Penal interest can be charged only once for one period of default and therefore cannot be permitted to be capitalised. [Paras 38 and 55(1)] While decreeing a suit if the decree be for payment of money, the court would adjudge the principal sum on the date of the suit. The court may also be called upon to adjudge interest due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff for the pre-suit period which interest would obviously be other than such interest as has already stood capitalised and having shed its character as interest, has acquired the colour of the principal and having stood amalgamated in the principal sum would be adjudged so. The principal sum adjudged would be the sum actually loaned plus the amount of interest on periodical rests which according to the contract between the parties or the established banking practice has stood capitalised. Interest pendente lite and future interest (i.e. interest post- decree not exceeding 6 per cent per annum) shall be awarded on such principal sum i.e. the principal sum adjudged on the date of the suit. It is well settled that the use of the word \"may\" in Section 34 confers a discretion on the court to award or not to award interest or to award interest at such rate as it deems fit. Such interest, so far as future interest is concerned may commence from the date of the decree and may be made to stop running either with payment or with such earlier date as the court thinks fit. [Paras 41 and 58(1)] Secy., Irrigation Deptt., Govt. ofOrissa v. G.C. Roy, (1992) 1 sec 508, referred to Mulla: Code of Civil Procedure (1995 Edn.), referred to Therefore, subject to a binding stipulation contained in a voluntary contract between the parties and/or an established practice or usage, interest on loans and advances may be charged on periodical rests and also capitalised on remaining unpaid. The principal sum actually advanced coupled with the interest on periodical rests so capitalised is capable of being adjudged as principal sum on the date of the suit. [Para 58(1)] The interest once capitalised ceases to be interest and becomes a part of principal sum or capital and therefore the question of awarding interest on interest does not arise at all. Moreover, a construction which leads to repugnancy or inconsistency has to be avoided. Ordinarily, a word or expression used at several places in one enactment should be assigned the same meaning so as to avoid \"a head-on clash\" between two meanings assigned to the same word or expression occurring at two places in the same enactment. However it is possible to find a situation when the same word or expression may have a somewhat different meaning at different places depending on the subject or context. This is however an exception which can be resorted to only in the event of repugnancy in the subject or context being spelled out. (Para 42) Farrell v. Alexander, (1976) 2 All ER 721 : 1977 AC 59 : (1976) 3 WLR 145 (HL), relied on Justice G.P. Singh : Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 7th Edn., 1999, p. 113, referred to Generally speaking, the use of the word \"such\" as an adjective prefixed to a noun is indicative of the draftsman's intention that he is assigning the same meaning or characteristic to the noun as has been previously indicated or that he is referring to something which has been said before.

(Para 43) Webster's Dictionary; New Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus, referred to Therefore, the meaning assigned to the expression \"the principal sum adjudged\" should continue to be assigned to \"principal sum\" at such other places in Section 34(1) where the expression has been used qualified by the adjective \"such\", that is to say, as \"such principal sum\". Recognition of the method of capitalisation of interest so as to make it a part of the principal consistently with a the contract between the parties or established banking practice does not offend the sense of reason, justice and equity. The underlying principle is that when b interest is debited to the account of the borrower on periodical rests, it is debited because of it having fallen due on that day. If the interest is not paid on the date due, from that date the creditor is deprived of such use of the money which it would have made if the debtor had paid the amount of interest on the date due. The creditor needs to be compensated for deprivation. Therefore, the expression \"the principal sum adjudged\" may include the amount of interest, charged on c periodical rests, and capitalised with the principal sum actually advanced, so as to become an amalgam of principal in such cases where it is permissible or obligatory for the court to hold so. Where the principal sum (on the date of suit) has been so adjudged, the same shall be treated as \"principal sum\" for the purpose of \"such principal sum\" - the expression employed later in Section 34 CPC. [Paras 44 and 58(2)] Pazhaniappa Mudaliar v. Narayana Ayyar , AIR 1943 Mad 157 : (1942) 2 MLJ 753, d approved The 1956 amendment serves a twofold purpose. Firstly, it prevents award of interest on the amount of interest so adjudged on the date of suit. Secondly, it brings the last clause of Section 34, by narrowing down its ambit, in conformity with the scope of the first clause insofar as the expression \"the principal sum adjudged\" occurring in the first part of Section 34 is concerned which has been e left untouched by amendment. The meaning to be assigned to this expression in the first part remains the same as it was even before the amendment. However, in the third part of Section 34 the words used were \"on the aggregate sum so adjudged\". The judicial opinion prevalent then was that \"aggregate sum\" contemplated the aggregate of (i) the principal sum adjudged, (ii) the interest from the date of the suit to the date of decree, and (iii) the pre-suit interest. Future interest was capable of being awarded also on the amount of pre-suit f interest - adjudged as such, that is, away from such interest as was adjudged as principal sum having amalgamated into it by virtue of capitalisation. The amendment is intended to deprive the court of its pre-amendment power to award interest on interest i.e. interest on interest adjudged as such. The amendment cannot be read as intending, expressly or by necessary implication, to deprive the court of its power to award future interest on the amount of the g principal sum adjudged. (Para 45) Prabirendra Mohan v. Berhampore Bank Ltd., AIR 1954 Cal 289 : 57 CWN 933, referred to The contention that such an interpretation of Section 34 would enable the banks to deliberately delay the recovery suit and gain an advantage by continuing to charge interest at the contract rate and by capitalising the same has to be repelled for several reasons. Firstly, the bank can afford to wait or delay the h filing of the suit only during the period of limitation which delay would not be ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Secondly, nothing prevents the debtor, even during the period of this delay, to pay or tender the amount of interest as and when it falls due and thereby prevent its capitalisation. Thirdly, the court is not powerless to deny the bank's claim for interest, if in the facts and circumstances of a given case the court is persuaded to hold that filing of the suit was delayed for the purpose of deliberately gaining an unfair advantage over adverse financial condition of the defendant. In such cases the pre-suit interest though claimed in accordance with the contract would be denied by the court on the ground of public policy and on the ground of the creditor having tried to gain an unfair advantage over the debtor by a deliberate inaction of himself. (Para 46) The further contention that such an interpretation would render the words \"in addition to any interest . . . of the suit\", redundant cannot be accepted. The same plaintiff while suing the same defendant may join in the suit more causes of action than one; one permitting capitalisation of interest, and the other, not permitting the same. In all such cases the principal sum inclusive of capitalised interest to the extent permissible shall be adjudged as \"principal sum\" and there would also be \"in addition any interest adjudged by way of interest on such principal sum\" for the pre-suit period. The Solicitor-General is right in submitting that part of Section 34(1) which speaks of \"interest adjudged on such principal sum\" for pre-suit period, the text should be read as if by reading \"interest\" qualified by \"if any\" so as to make it meaningful. (Para 47) Therefore, it has to be held that a creditor can charge interest from his debtor on periodical rests and also capitalise the same so as to make it a part of the principal. Such a course can be justified by stipulation in a contract voluntarily entered into between the parties or by a practice or usage well established in the world to which the parties belong. Such practice is to be found already in vogue in the field of banking business. Such contract or usage or practice can stand abrogated by legislation such as usury laws or debt relief laws and so on. [Paras 49 and 58(1)] Corpn. Bank v. D.S. Gowda, (1994) 5 SCC 213; Bank of Baroda v. Jagannath Pigment & Chem., (1996) 5 sec at p. 280 , affirmed The following notes of caution are relevant to the law laid down herein: (1) Penal interest cannot be capitalised. It will be opposed to public policy. Further interest i.e. interest on interest, whether simple, compound or penal, cannot be claimed on the amount of penal interest. [Para 55(1)] (2) Novation that is, a debtor entering into a fresh agreement with a creditor undertaking payment of previously borrowed principal amount coupled with interest by treating the sum total as principal, any contract express or implied and an express acknowledgement of accounts, are the best evidence of capitalisation. Acquiescence in the method of accounting adopted by the creditor and brought to the knowledge of the debtor may also enable interest being converted into principal. A mere failure to protest is not acquiescence . [Para 55(2)] (3) Stipulations as to interest on periodical rests and their capitalisation incorporated in contracts voluntarily entered into and binding on the parties shall govern the substantive rights and obligations of the parties as to recovery and payment of interest.

It will be useful to reproduce the order of reference dated 7-5-1996 (since reported as Central Bank of India v. Ravindra 1) so as to highlight the nature and scope of controversy arising for decision before the Constitution Bench: (SCC pp . 279-80, paras 1-2) \"ORDER 1. After hearing learned Attorney-General and amicus curiae S/Shri A. Subba Rao, Ranjit Kumar and K.M.K. Nair on the interpretation of the provisions of Section 34 CPC on 'the principal sum adjudged' the matter is required to be considered by a Constitution Bench. The learned Attorney-General has drawn our attention to the judgments of this Court in Corpn. Bank v. D.S. Gowda 2 and Bank of Baroda v. Jagannath Pigment & Chem. 3 wherein he sought to draw the deduction that the principal sum adjudged and the principal sum mentioned later would be the same. He seeks to take support from the word 'such' in support of his contention. Preceding Amendment Act 66 of 1956, the words were 'aggregate sum so adjudged' and after amendment, were substituted with the words 'the principal sum adjudged', from the date of the suit to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such 'principal sum' for any period prior to the institution of the suit (with further interest on such date as the court deems reasonable on the 'principal sum')* . The distinction, therefore, was not drawn to the attention of this Court in the aforesaid two judgments in particular the later one. As a fact no argument in this behalf appears to have been canvassed. Interpretation of the liability of the borrower to pay interest on the principal sum to include interest that became merged with the principal sum adjudged or principal sum as lent, is required to be authoritatively laid down by a Bench of five Judges. 2. The Registry is directed to place the matter before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for constituting the Constitution Bench.\" * [sic, should have been - with further interest at such rate not exceeding six per cent per annum, as the court deems reasonable on such \"principal sum\", in our opinion] h 1 (1996) s sec 219 2 (1994) s sec 213 3 (1996) s sec at p. 280 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The Committee are of the opinion that interest should not be awarded on interest but only on the principal sum. Suitable amendment has accordingly been incorporated in this clause.\" The controversy and contending pleas 6.

Inasmuch we propose (also as has been agreed to by all the learned counsel appearing for the parties) to decide only the question of law posed for decision and leave the individual cases to be decided by appropriate Bench consistently with the law laid down by the Constitution Bench, we are relieved of the need of noticing facts of individual cases. Suffice it, for our purpose, to notice in very brief, by way of c illustration, the facts of SLP (C) No. 2421 of 1993 - Central Bank of India v. Ravindra 1 - to demonstrate the nature of controversy. The petitioner Bank sanctioned a loan to Respondent 1 on the guarantee of Respondents 2 and 3. On 21-6-1979, Respondent 1 executed a demand promissory note for Rs 1,37,720 and also executed term agreement of hypothecation of the vehicle. The loan carried interest at the rate of 11 % per annum with quarterly d rests as on 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December every year. The total outstanding inclusive of the interest charged as per agreement, was Rs 1,51,825 on the date of the suit for the recovery whereof the suit was filed by the petitioner Bank. Relief was also prayed for the grant of interest pendente lite and future interest till realisation. The trial court passed a decree for Rs 1,51,825 with future interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of the suit till realisation affording the respondents facility of e payment of the decretal amount in 6 quarterly instalments with exigibility clause. An appeal preferred by the Bank before the High Court was partly allowed modifying the decree of the trial court by awarding interest at the rate of 11 % per annum and setting aside the facility of payment by instalments. However, the High Court directed the interest at the rate of 11 % per annum to be payable only on Rs 99,000, which was stated to be the f principal sum, from the date of the suit till realisation though the decree for Rs 1,51,825, the amount due and payable on the date of the suit, was maintained. The petitioner Bank is aggrieved by the decree of the High Court to the extent to which future interest at the rate of 11 % per annum has not been allowed on the entire sum ofRs 1,51,825. 7.

Other learned counsel appearing for other borrowers were also heard. 8. The learned Solicitor-General submitted that the expression \"the a principal sum adjudged\" used in Section 34 may have two meanings: (i) the amounts actually disbursed to the borrower, or (ii) the amount due from the borrower on the date of the suit which amount would include the amount of interest due and payable on the date of the institution of the suit in the court. He made two submissions. First is the wider submission, as he named it, that whatever is the amount due and payable by the defendant on the date of the b institution of the suit becomes \"the principal sum adjudged\" on which the judgment-debtor can be directed to pay interest pendente lite and for future. The learned Solicitor-General however did not seriously press and pursue this wider submission and gave it up soon after projecting the same before the Court. However, he insistently pressed and pursued the second one i.e. the narrower submission that \"the principal sum adjudged\" would include all C sums as are due under the contract between the parties and have stood capitalised with the amount actually disbursed to the borrower. The amalgam - an intimate mixture - would be adjudged as the principal sum and would not permit any attempt at unscrambling. Developing the narrower argument further, the learned Solicitor-General submitted that the contract between the parties or an established bank practice (in the case of banking transactions) may provide for the interest on periodical rests being compounded and d capitalised with the principal, in which event, the amount debited in the account of the borrower shall shed its character as interest and become the principal on being capitalised and therefore shall have to be adjudged as \"the principal sum\" on the date of the suit. The contract or established banking practice shall govern the relationship between the parties and bind the court. The court will not reopen the account so as to separate from the amalgam - e the interest charged and the sums actually advanced, and repaint the interest with the colour which had stood shed off unless mandate of law overrides the contract or practice and enables or compels the court to do so. Any view to the contrary, if accepted, would be destructive of banking system which is functioning on a practice recognised for over a century over the world, submitted the learned Solicitor-General. f 9. The learned Solicitor-General further submitted that the position of law remains the same insofar as the meaning of \"the principal sum adjudged\" occurring in the first part of Section 34(1) is concerned and the principal sum so adjudged shall be the amount on which the court shall award interest pendente lite i.e. from the date of the suit to the date of the decree as also the future interest. In other words, submitted the learned Solicitor-General, the g court shall adjudge the principal sum as it stands just anterior to the date of the suit consistently with the contract or banking practice binding the parties and once that is done \"the principal sum adjudged\" shall be \"such principal sum\" for the purpose of interest pendente lite as also future interest.

There may be cases where the total amount debited to the account of the debtor as interest has stood capitalised in its entirety in which case there may not be any sum of interest left and available to be treated as interest, other than the principal sum for the pre-suit period. The correct way of reading the opening part of Section 34 would be - \"the principal sum adjudged ... in addition to interest, if any, adjudged on such principal sum\". \"Any interest adjudged on such principal sum\" means and should be read as \"interest, if any, adjudged on such principal sum\". The learned Solicitor-General went on to submit that the 1956 amendment does not have any bearing on the meaning of the words \"the principal sum adjudged\" which remains the same pre- and post-1956. The 1956 amendment, which has substituted the words \"on such principal sum\" for the words \"on the aggregate sum so adjudged\" has only this effect that prior to the amendment future interest was capable of being awarded on the aggregate of three components taken together i.e. (J) the principal sum (so adjudged), (2) pre-suit interest (so adjudged), and (3) decretal costs. By virtue of the 1956 amendment, the amount of interest adjudged as interest on the date of the suit and decretal costs cannot be ordered to carry future interest, but the amount adjudged as principal sum though inclusive of interest which has stood capitalised and has partaken character of principal by virtue of contract or banking practice, is capable of bearing future interest because it will be \"the principal sum adjudged\". 10. Shri Ranjit Kumar, Senior Advocate, the learned amicus as also the other learned counsel appearing for the debtors have submitted that if the submission made by the learned Solicitor-General is accepted it would defeat the legislative intent behind the amendment as it would mean the court awarding interest on interest. It was submitted that without regard to the fact that the interest for the pre-suit period has stood capitalised by force of contract or banking practice between the parties, and has assumed the colour and character of principal sum, the contract or banking practice ceases to be applicable once the suit is filed and the matter has entered the domain of the court under Section 34 CPC, whereafter nothing prevents the court from unscrambling the amalgam so as to sieve out the principal from interest and confine the award of interest pendente lite and post-decree to principal sum only. Capitalisation of interest debited on periodical rests - does it convert interest into \"the principal sum\"? - a survey of judicial opinion 11.

It is balanced at the close of each year; and the periodical interest on advances accruing in the course of the year is placed to the debit side of the account, and to the extent of its amount the balance carried to the debit at the commencement of next year is increased. That amount is dealt with as a principal sum, on which interest is calculated, - the bank thereby securing, as they were entitled to do, interest on the b accumulated amount each year, or, as it is generally stated, but not quite correctly, compound interest. The true view is, that the periodical interest at the end of each year is a debt to be then paid, and which must be held to have been paid when placed to the debit of the account as an additional advance by the bank for the convenience of the obligants.\" (at p. 238) C Lord Justice Clerk said: \"The parties must of course have had in view that this account- current would be kept in the way, in which bankers always keep such accounts, balancing the account at the end of the year; and, in the event of the interest accruing during the past year not being otherwise paid or provided for, placing the amount of such interest as the last item to the d debit of the account, and accumulating such interest along with the principal sum due on the account, and bringing down the balance thus ascertained, consisting partly of principal, and partly of interest, to the new account for the ensuing year, and placing the accumulated balance as the first article of debit in that new account.

Hibernian Bank Ltd. 5 interest was charged from day to day with half-yearly rests, so that the interest was capitalised every half year a in accordance with the terms of the deed which also contained ceiling on the principal sum which could be recoverable on the security. Lord Atkinson observed in his speech that whenever on balancing the mortgagor's current account with the bank a debit balance was found against him, that balance, by force of the covenant, became part of the principal moneys secured by the mortgage, subject, however, to the covenant limit. Lord Wrenbury opined b that the interest upon the overdraft was capitalised half-yearly and as against the bank the capitalised interest must be regarded as principal and hence the debit balance of the overdraft banking account was principal. In IRC v. Sir H.C. Holder, Bt. 6 the bank debited half-yearly interest to the borrower's bank account on the amount owing from time to time. It was held that the interest due each half year which, upon the failure of the company to pay it, was, c according to the regular practice of bankers, added to the capital sum advanced, was thereby capitalised and could not thereafter be treated as interest. Lord Hanworth, M.R. noted in his speech that the plan of capitalising interest at the end of each half year was adopted by bankers in order to enable them in effect to secure what is usually termed compound interest, which could not have otherwise been claimed by reason of the usury d laws. Later His Lordship noted that under-consideration was not the terms of a particular deed entered into between the parties, but a practice which has been adopted by bankers for over a century, and which has had certain qualities attributed to it. Lord Romer concurring with Lord Hanworth opined that having regard to the method in which, with the concurrence of the company, the account was kept by the bank, the company must be deemed to e have paid each half year the accruing interest by means of an advance made for this purpose by the bank to the company. 14. Holder v. IRC7 and Paton (Fenton's Trustee) v. /RC 8 are cases under the income tax law. In Holder case 7 it was held that in view of the bank's practice of adding the interest each half year to the amount advanced, the interest was in effect paid each half year to the bank by means of advances f made for that purpose by the bank to the customer and for this reason no part of payment (later) made by the taxpayer was payment of interest and hence the taxpayer was not entitled to the relief claimed. In Paton case 8 each half-year interest at an agreed rate, and without deduction of tax, was placed to the debit of the account of the borrower and the aggregate amount was then treated as principal for the following half year. Question arose, whether g the interest in question which was capitalised could be said to have been in fact paid by the borrower so as to attract applicability to him of certain beneficial provision of the Income Tax Act, 1918.

It takes its position as part of the whole debt due to the bank, and, as part of the whole debt, is in the next half year chargeable with interest.\" His Lordship approved the view of Russell, J. of Court of Appeal taking the view that because of a provision contained in the deed between the parties b which enables the interest to be capitalised, the interest is not capitalised because it is in fact paid, but because it has in fact not been paid. Lord Macmillan opined: (All ER pp. 796F- 797B) \"It may well be that, in a question between a bank and its customer, and equally between a bank and its customer's cautioner, the interest accruing annually may, by the sanctioned method of accounting, cease to c be interest when it is accumulated with the principal, so that the bank can thereafter no longer sue for the interest as interest. ... It is manifest, however, that it is only by a legal fiction that the interest in such cases as the present can be said to have been paid. After, as before, the striking of the balance, the same sum remains due, no longer, it may be, as interest, but still due as part of the principal debt. In construing the extent of the cautioner's liability under the cash credit bond, the court would appear to d have been well founded in their view that the bank's own method of accounting, assented to by the principal debtor, and recognised as ordinary practice, precluded any claim for past interest as interest prior to the last balance. The cautioner was liable for whatever was drawn upon the cash credit account up to £ 400, and the unpaid interest was debited in account just like the ordinary drafts upon it, and became part of the e principal debtor's capital indebtedness, for which the cautioner was liable up to £ 400, with interest subsequent to the last balance.\" 15. In National Bank of Greece S.A. v. Pinios Shipping Co. No. 19 the House of Lords upheld the entitlement of the bank to the principal sum due to it, with interest thereon, as agreed, until payment or judgment in the usual way, and that the agreement included the term, implied by the usage of f bankers, that the bank was entitled to capitalise interest, which in the case before Their Lordships, was (by concession) at quarterly rests and that such entitlement continued until judgment or payment. In the Court of Appeal 9a, Lloyd, L.J., who wrote the leading order, was of the opinion that an implied agreement to pay compound interest with quarterly rest based on the banking practice exists during the currency of the banker-customer relationship but g once the banker-customer relationship ceases the bank cannot charge compound interest and only simple interest would be payable.

The bank appealed to the House of Lords 9 • The House of Lords allowed the appeal and modified the judgment of the Court of Appeal by holding that no reason can be seen why that relationship should not be continued until repayment of the debt, or judgment, whichever first occurred, with the effect that, so long as the contractual interest was payable, the bank continued to be entitled to capitalise it. The House of Lords did not agree with the Court of Appeal that the relationship of banker and customer stood terminated by the bank's demand for payment. 17. In Balla Mal v. Ahad Shah 12 the Privy Council recognised the justification for adding on the accumulated interest under an earlier transaction in the fresh transaction and observed as under: (All LJ p. 909) ''A borrower who obtains a loan secured by a promissory note on quite reasonable terms, by neglecting to pay the note at maturity, further neglecting to pay the accruing interest for the several years following, and then giving a renewal note for the original debt plus the capitalised interest, could produce a result which might at first sight appear oppressive, and yet there would be nothing harsh or unconscionable in the creditor's demand since the added interest only accumulated while he forebore to enforce the payment of the sums from time to time due to him.\" (emphasis supplied) 18.

Smith 15, and the decision by the Court of Appeal in Reading Trust v.

Their Lordships upheld the charge of 15% interest payable on the sums from time to time acknowledged to be b owing by the borrowers to the lenders and thus allowing interest on interest. However, interest charged@ 24% on the loan and charges which were amply secured by charges on rubber estate which had been well looked after and kept in good order was held unreasonable, excessive and unfair. The fact remains that Their Lordships approved charging of interest @ 15% and capitalisation of the same by means of acknowledgement to that effect by the C borrowers and also upheld permissibility of further 15% interest being charged on the sum so capitalised. 19. It was pointed out in Lyle v. Chappell 14 (at p. 706) that it ought not to make any difference to the validity of a transaction by way of a renewal of a loan, whether the parties go through the form of payment by the borrower of the whole amount due and a relending of the same amount by the moneylender, or the transaction is carried out without any such payment by d treating the amount of principal and interest still due as a debt acknowledged by the borrower together with an undertaking by the borrower to pay the amount of the agreed debt. 20.

The words \"on the principal amount found or declared due e on the mortgage\" came up for the consideration of the Division Bench. It was contended for the borrower that in calculating the amount due to the mortgagee up to the date fixed for redemption, interest from the date of the decree till the date fixed for redemption should be calculated on the principal sum secured by the deed and not on the total amount due on the date of the decree on account of principal as well as compound interest. The mortgage f deed provided for interest being calculated six-monthly and that if it was not paid then it would become a part of the principal. The Division Bench held that the words \"on the principal amount found or declared due\" refer not only to the principal sum secured by the mortgage deed but also to the amount due on account of interest which has become a part of the principal in accordance with the terms of the deed on the date when the preliminary decree is g prepared.

Raghubir Singh 19 • In Pazhaniappa Mudaliar v. Narayana Ayyar2° the mode of dealing adopted by the parties was what is usually followed between a banker and customer. The effect of this system is to capitalise the interest at the end of each year and treat it as a fresh advance by the bank. The Division Bench noted that according to the usage prevailing between bankers and customers, it is an implied term of their dealing that the banker is to be treated as having made an advance to the customer at the end of each year or half year, as the case may be, of a sum equivalent in amount to the interest accruing during that period, so as to enable the customer to discharge the interest, increasing the principal of his debt by a corresponding amount. It was urged that the periodical settlement of accounts evidenced by the borrower's letters of acknowledgement were renewals and only the sums advanced as principal were repayable notwithstanding its capitalisation of interest from time to time; the interest being still treated as interest and wiped out. The Division Bench speaking through Patanjali Sastri, J. (as His Lordship then was) noted that if the effect of the mode of dealing adopted between banker and customer is, according to the long-standing usage governing their relations, to treat the interest accruing in any year as discharged by a borrowing of an equivalent sum from the bank \"in precisely the same way as if the customer had given the bank a cheque upon the account for the amount in question with which the bank extinguished the interest and then placed the amount of the cheque to the debit of the account as an ordinary draft,\" (AIR p. 159) it is difficult to see how the operation of this principle is affected by anything contained in the explanation to be found in the relevant provision of the Madras Agriculturists' Relief Act, 1938 which merely provides that in cases of renewal of the debt, the sums advanced as principal shall alone be treated as the principal sum repayable by the agriculturists; for, the interest of the previous year is, under the rule, discharged, and the corresponding increase in the indebtedness of the customer is treated as a principal sum advanced by the bank. 21. Two decisions by the Kerala High Court may now be noticed. Palai Central Bank Ltd. v. C.

Thandamma v. Kuriakore Putherickal Iype 22 is a Full Bench decision which, though did not notice the Division Bench decision in Palai Central Bank Ltd. 21 laid down the same law. An overdraft agreement entered into by the defendants with the plaintiff bank provided that the interest at 7 1/2% as agreed upon will be calculated quarterly, four times b every year, and added to the principal. On the balance shown as due on 31- 12-1952 in the account maintained by the bank in pursuance of such agreement, the suit was filed for recovery of the amount due on 31-12-1952 as principal with future interest till the date of the suit. It was held that the effect of the agreement was to wipe off all interest outstanding at the end of each quarter by means of further advances from the bank of similar amounts c which are debited to the account of the debtor. It was further held that the interest that thus accumulated with the principal at the end of each quarter became principal and never thereafter ceased to be dealt with as principal. The amount due on 31-12-1952 in the account was treated as the principal amount outstanding on 1-11-1953. However, in passing the Full Bench noted that the position may have been different if under a local debt relief law it d was subsequently provided that the principal would mean the amount originally advanced together with sum, if any, subsequently advanced, notwithstanding any stipulation to treat any interest as principal. 22. In K. Appa Rao v. V.L. Varadaraj2 3 the Division Bench, speaking through Nainar Sundram, J., pointed out that the charging of compound interest by itself is not per se usurious except in the case of an agriculturist e protected by the Usurious Loans Act, 1918 as amended in its application in Madras. However, the Division Bench, by reference to an earlier decision of that High Court, pointed out that for the purpose of determining whether interest would be excessive or not the risk incurred by the creditor by advancing the loan (whether it was secured or not and if secured to what extent) and if compound interest is charged, the periods at which it is f calculated and the total advantage which may be reasonably expected to have accrued from the transaction, are important factors. 23.

The Orissa High Court has followed the Delhi decision abovesaid. It was a case of commercial loan. The amount of interest quarterly added to the amount of loan was held entitled as principal amount on the date of the suit for the purpose of future interest. 25. In State Bank of India v. Avtar Singh Saih 28 while rejecting the borrower's application under Order 6 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking direction to the bank to point out separately by breaking up its claim so as to show the amount of the principal and the interest separately, it was held that the principal amount found due not only means the principal amount but also the amount due as interest which has become part of the principal. 26. In Nedungadi Bank Ltd. v. Aswathi Starch and Glucose (P) Ltd. 29 K.G. Balakrishnan, J. (as His Lordship then was), speaking for the Division Bench, held that the expression \"principal sum adjudged\" used in Section 34 indicates that it is not the original principal amount but it could be an amount so adjudged as principal. If, as per the contract between the parties, interest also is to be treated as principal, the amount so adjudged is to be taken as principal for granting future interest. 27. In State Bank of India v. Neela Ashok Naik 30 Y.K. Sabharwal, C.J. (as His Lordship then was) speaking for the Division Bench, dealing with Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code, held that legal position clearly was that \"the principal sum adjudged\" can include in it interest as well, depending upon the contract between the parties.

In other words, if he fails to pay interest in accordance with the contract, he is liable to pay interest on interest. To put it differently, when the interest payable is not paid, the same becomes a part of the principal and thereafter interest has to be paid not only on the original b principal but also on that part of the interest which had become a part of the principal. 29. In Corpn. Bank v. D.S. Gowda 2 a batch of appeals against three decisions of the Karnataka High Court (reported as D.S. Gowda v. Corpn. Bank 32 , H.P. Krishna Reddy v. Canara Bank 33 and Bank of India v. Karnam Ranga Rao 34 ) were disposed of and while doing so two decisions of the c Andhra Pradesh High Court, namely, Koramsetty C. Venkateswarlu v. Syndicate Bank 35 and State Bank of India, Re 36 were also noticed and dealt with. D.S. Gowda case 32 was of a commercial advance taken by the borrower for the purpose of constructing residential flats on a building site allotted by Bangalore Development Authority. Interest at the rate of 16.5% per annum, with quarterly rests, was charged. Interest, penal interest and service charges d were debited to the account and capitalised. In the cases of H.P. Krishna Reddy 33 and Kamam Ranga Rao 34 loans were advanced for agricultural purposes. Directions made by the Reserve Bank of India were violated and the interest was charged at rates far excess of the limits prescribed by the Reserve Bank, also by compounding at quarterly rests, not permitted by the Reserve Bank. One of the questions having a bearing on the day-to-day e transactions of loan/advance entered into by the banks was: whether the bank is entitled to claim interest with periodical rests e.g. a monthly rest, a quarterly rest, a six-monthly rest, or a yearly rest, or compound interest in any other manner, from a borrower who has obtained a loan or an advance for agricultural/commercial purposes, as the case may be. During the course of its judgment the Court observed (vide sec pp. 228-29, para 14): r \"[C]harging of interest with periodical rests or compounding of interest would be allowed if there is evidence of the customer having acquiesced therein, provided the relation of banker and customer is subsisting. However, if the relationship undergoes a change into that of mortgagee and mortgagor by the taking of a mortgage, the charging of interest would be governed in accordance with the terms of the mortgage. g 31 (1973) 4 sec 115 : 1973 sec (fax) 401 2 (1994) 5 sec 213 32 AIR 1983 Kant 143 : (1982) 2 Kant LJ 490 33 AIR 1985 Kant 228: (1985) 2 Kant LJ 115 34 AIR 1986 Kant 242: (1986) 1 Kant LJ 359 35 AIR 1986 AP 290 36 AIR 1986 AP 291 : (1986) 1 An LT 417 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Thus, the practice of bankers to debit the accrued interest to the borrower's current account at regular periods is a recognised practice.\" 30. Their Lordships cited with approval the following passage from Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 3, at p. 118, para 160: \"160. Interest.-By the universal custom of bankers, a banker has the right to charge simple interest at a reasonable rate on all overdrafts. An unusual rate of interest, interest with periodical rests, or compound interest can only be justified, in the absence of express agreement, where the customer is shown or must be taken to have acquiesced in the account being kept on that basis. Whether such acquiescence can be assumed from his failure to protest at an interest entry in his statement of account is doubtful. Acquiescence in such charges only justifies them so long as the relation of banker and customer exists with respect to the advance. If the relation is altered into that of mortgagee and mortgagor by the taking of a mortgage, interest must be calculated according to the terms of the mortgage, or according to the new relation. The taking of a mortgage to secure a fluctuating balance of an overdrawn account, is not, however, inconsistent with the relation of banker and customer, so as to displace a previously accrued right to charge compound interest. It is the practice of bankers to debit the accrued interest to the borrower's current account at regular periods (usually half-yearly); where the current account is overdrawn or becomes overdrawn as the result of the debit the effect is to add the interest to the principal, in which case it loses its quality of interest and becomes capital.\" (emphasis supplied) 31.

The principal relevant consideration which prevailed with the Court were: continuing judicial upholding of such practice over a length of time and the Reserve Bank of India by issuing circulars/directives from time to time and on paying \"adequate attention\" having accorded its approval to permissibility of such practice but intervening in the interest of streamlining the same. 32.

Rs 1,20,675.59 and not the principal sum adjudged i.e. Rs 1,66,759.29. This Court set aside the appellate judgment of the High Court and restored the decree passed by the trial Judge. 33. In Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. 37 (SCC b paras 89-93) a three-Judge Bench of this Court has noted the practice of charging interest as prevalent in Australia, Canada and India and held that compound interest can be awarded by courts in India when justice so demands and is not to be regarded as being against public policy. The Court noted that it is common knowledge that provision is made for the payment of compound interest in contracts for loans advanced by banks and financial c institutions and such contracts are enforced by courts. 34. Shri Ranjit Kumar, the learned amicus brought to the notice of the Court a few decisions taking the view that under Section 34 CPC principal sum has to be read as consisting of the amounts actually advanced and hence the Court must unscramble the amalgam and segregate such principal sum from the amount of interest compounded and capitalised and confine award d of interest pendente lite and post-decree only to such principal sum.

The Full Bench decision of the Bombay High Court in Union Bank of India v.

Bank of Baroda, which has been reversed by this Court*. D.S. Gowda case 32 of the Karnataka High Court was also reversed by this Court. Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab High Court decisions cited by the learned amicus, are based on the Bombay High Court Full Bench view. In I.K. Merchants Ltd. case 40 the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court has not approved interest being awarded on the sum adjudged as interest for the pre-suit period (see para 31 of the Report). To the same effect is the Division Bench decision of the Gujarat High Court in Gujarat Agro case 42 • These two decisions have no relevance to the issue before us. Conclusion which follows 36. The English decisions and the decisions of this Court and almost all the High Courts of the country have noticed and approved long-established banking practice of charging interest at reasonable rates on periodical rests and capitalising the same on remaining unpaid. Such a practice is prevalent and also recognised in non-banking moneylending transactions. The legislature has stepped in from time to time to relieve the debtors from hardship whenever it has found the practice of charging compound interest and its capitalisation to be oppressive and hence needing to be curbed. The practice is permissible, legal and judicially upheld excepting when superseded by legislation. There is nothing wrong in the parties voluntarily entering into transactions, evidenced by deeds incorporating covenant or stipulation for payment of compound interest at reasonable rates, and authorising the creditor to capitalise the interest on remaining unpaid so as to enable interest being charged at the agreed rate on the interest component of the capitalised sum for the succeeding period. Interest once capitalised, sheds its colour of being interest and becomes a part of principal so as to bind the debtor/borrower. Interest and its classes 37.

According to Stroud's Judicial Dictionary of Words And Phrases (5th a Edn.) interest means, inter alia, compensation paid by the borrower to the lender for deprivation of the use of his money. In Secy., Irrigation Deptt., Govt. of Orissa v. G. C. Roy 46 the Constitution Bench opined that a person deprived of the use of money to which he is legitimately entitled has a right to be compensated for the deprivation, call it by any name. It may be called interest, compensation or damages ... this is the principle of Section 34 of the b Civil Procedure Code. In Sham Lal Narula (Dr) v. C/'1'4-7 this Court held that interest is paid for the deprivation of the use of the money. The essence of interest in the opinion of Lord Wright, in Riches v. Westminster Bank Ltd. 48 All ER at p. 472 is that it is a payment which becomes due because the creditor has not had his money at the due date. It may be regarded either as representing the profit he might have made if he had had the use of the C money, or, conversely, the loss he suffered because he had not that use. The general idea is that he is entitled to compensation for the deprivation; the money due to the creditor was not paid, or, in other words, was withheld from him by the debtor after the time when payment should have been made, in breach of his legal rights, and interest was a compensation whether the compensation was liquidated under an agreement or statute. A Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab speaking through Tek Chand, J. in CIT v. d Dr Sham Lal Narula 49 thus articulated the concept of interest: (AIR p. 414, para 8) \"8. The words 'interest' and 'compensation' are sometimes used interchangeably and on other occasions they have distinct connotation. 'Interest' in general terms is the return or compensation for the use or e retention by one person of a sum of money belonging to or owed to another. In its narrow sense, 'interest' is understood to mean the amount which one has contracted to pay for use of borrowed money. ... In whatever category 'interest' in a particular case may be put, it is a consideration paid either for the use of money or for forbearance in demanding it, after it has fallen due, and thus, it is a charge for the use or f forbearance of money. In this sense, it is a compensation allowed by law or fixed by parties, or permitted by custom or usage, for use of money, belonging to another, or for the delay in paying money after it has become payable.\" It is the appeal against this decision of the Punjab High Court which was dismissed by the Supreme Court in Dr Sham Lal Narula case 47 • g 38.

RA VIND RA ( Lahoti, J.) 395 payment when it should have been made, in favour of the person wronged and it is neither related with nor limited to the damages suffered. Thus, while liability to pay interest is founded on the doctrine of compensation, penal interest is a penalty founded on the doctrine of penal action. Penal interest can be charged only once for one period of default and therefore cannot be permitted to be capitalised. 39. Mulla on the Code of Civil Procedure (1995 Edn.) sets out three divisions of interest as dealt in Section 34 CPC. The division is according to the period for which interest is allowed by the court, namely,- (1) interest accrued due prior to the institution of the suit on the principal sum adjudged; (2) additional interest on the principal sum adjudged, from the date of the suit to the date of the decree, at such rate as the court deems reasonable; (3) further interest on the principal sum adjudged, from the date of the decree to the date of the payment or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit, at a rate not exceeding 6 per cent per annum. Popularly the three interests are called pre-suit interest, interest pendente lite and interest post-decree or future interest. Interest for the period anterior to institution of suit is not a matter of procedure; interest pendente lite is not a matter of substantive law (see Secy., Irrigation Deptt ., Govt. of Orissa v. G.C. Roy 46 SCC para 44-iv). Pre-suit interest is referable to substantive law and can be subdivided into two sub- heads: (i) where there is a stipulation for the payment of interest at a fixed rate; and (ii) where there is no such stipulation. If there is a stipulation for the rate of interest, the court must allow that rate up to the date of the suit subject to three exceptions: (i) any provision of law applicable to moneylending transactions, or usury laws or any other debt law governing the parties and having an overriding effect on any stipulation for payment of interest voluntarily entered into between the parties; (ii) if the rate is penal, the court must award at such rate as it deems reasonable; (iii) even if the rate is not penal the court may reduce it if the interest is excessive and the transaction was substantially unfair. If there is no express stipulation for payment of interest the plaintiff is not entitled to interest except on proof of mercantile usage, statutory right to interest, or an implied agreement. Interest from the date of suit to the date of decree is in the discretion of the court. Interest from the date of the decree to the date of payment or any other earlier date appointed by the court is again in the discretion of the court - to award or not to award as also the rate at which to award. These principles are well established and are not disputed by learned counsel for the parties. We have stated the same only by way of introduction to the main controversy before us which has a colour little different and somewhat complex. The learned counsel appearing before us are agreed that pre-suit interest is a matter of substantive law and a voluntary stipulation entered into between the parties for payment of interest would bind the parties as also the court excepting in any case out of the three exceptions set out hereinbefore. \"Such principal sum\" - meaning of 40.

A few points are clear from a bare reading of the provision. While decreeing a suit if the decree be for payment of money, the court would adjudge the principal sum on the date of the suit. The court may also be called upon to adjudge interest due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff for the pre-suit period which interest would, on the findings arrived at and noted by us hereinabove, obviously be other than such interest as has c already stood capitalised and having shed its character as interest, has acquired the colour of the principal and having stood amalgamated in the principal sum would be adjudged so. The principal sum adjudged would be the sum actually loaned plus the amount of interest on periodical rests which according to the contract between the parties or the established banking practice has stood capitalised. Interest pendente lite and future interest (i.e. d interest post-decree not exceeding 6 per cent per annum) shall be awarded on such principal sum i.e. the principal sum adjudged on the date of the suit. It is well settled that the use of the word \"may'' in Section 34 confers a discretion on the court to award or not to award interest or to award interest at such rate as it deems fit. Such interest, so far as future interest is concerned may commence from the date of the decree and may be made to stop running e either with payment or with such earlier date as the court thinks fit. Shortly hereinafter we propose to give an indication of the circumstances in which the court may decline award of interest or may award interest at a rate lesser than the permissible rate. 42. It was submitted by the learned amicus and other counsel for the borrowers, that the expression \"on such principal sum\" as occurring twice in f the latter part of Section 34(1), which refers to interest pendente lite and post-decree, should be interpreted to mean principal sum arrived at by excluding the interest even if it has stood capitalised. This would be consistent with the legislative intent as reflected in the report of the Joint Committee and sought to be fulfilled by the 1956 amendment. For two reasons this contention has to be rejected. Firstly, entertaining such a plea amounts to begging the question. As we have already held that the interest g once capitalised ceases to be interest and becomes a part of principal sum or capital. That being so the interest forming amalgam with the principal, in view of having been capitalized, is the principal sum and therefore the question of awarding interest on interest does not arise at all. Secondly, well-settled principles of interpretation of statutes would frown upon such a plea being entertained. A construction which leads to repugnancy or h inconsistency has to be avoided.

RA VIND RA ( Lahoti, J.) 397 several places in one enactment should be assigned the same meaning so as to avoid \"a head-on clash\" between two meanings assigned to the same word or expression occurring at two places in the same enactment. It should not be lightly assumed that \"Parliament had given with one hand what it took away with the other\" (see Principles of Statutory Interpretation, Justice G.P. Singh, 7th Edn. 1999, p. 113). That construction is to be rejected which will introduce uncertainty, friction or confusion into the working of the system (ibid, p. 119). While embarking upon interpretation of words and expressions used in a statute it is possible to find a situation when the same word or expression may have somewhat different meaning at different places depending on the subject or context. This is however an exception which can be resorted to only in the event of repugnancy in the subject or context being spelled out. It has been the consistent view of the Supreme Court that when the legislature used same word or expression in different parts of the same section or statute, there is a presumption that the word is used in the same sense throughout (ibid, p. 263). More correct statement of the rule is, as held by the House of Lords in Farrell v. Alexander5° All ER at p. 736b, \"where the draftsman uses the same word or phrase in similar contexts, he must be presumed to intend it in each place to bear the same meaning\". The court having accepted invitation to embark upon interpretative expedition shall identify on its radar the contextual use of the word or expression and then determine its direction avoiding collision with icebergs of inconsistency and repugnancy. 43. Webster defines \"such\" as \"having the particular quality or character specified; certain; representing the object as already particularised in terms which are not mentioned\". In New Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus, meaning of \"such\" is given as \"of a kind previously or about to be mentioned or implied; of the same quality as something just mentioned (used to avoid the repetition of one word twice in a sentence); of a degree or quantity stated or implicit; the same as something just mentioned (used to avoid repetition of one word twice in a sentence); that part of something just stated or about to be stated\". Thus, generally speaking, the use of the word \"such\" as an adjective prefixed to a noun is indicative of the draftsman's intention that he is assigning the same meaning or characteristic to the noun as has been previously indicated or that he is referring to something which has been said before. This principle has all the more vigorous application when the two places employing the same expression, at the earlier place the expression having been defined or characterised and at the latter place having been qualified by use of the word \"such\", are situated in close proximity. 44. We are of the opinion that the meaning assigned to the expression \"the principal sum adjudged\" should continue to be assigned to \"principal sum\" at such other places in Section 34(1) where the expression has been used qualified by the adjective \"such\", that is to say, as \"such principal sum\". Recognition of the method of capitalisation of interest so as to make it a part of the principal consistently with the contract between the parties or established banking practice does not offend the sense of reason, justice and 50 (1976) 2All ER 721: 1977 AC 59: (1976) 3 WLR 145 (HL) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

As we have noticed, such a system has a long-established practice and a series of judicial precedents upholding the same. Secondly, the underlying principle as noticed in several decided cases is that when interest is debited to a the account of the borrower on periodical rests, it is debited because of it having fallen due on that day. Nothing prevents the borrower from paying the amount of interest on the date it falls due. If the amount of interest is paid there will be no occasion for capitalising the amount of interest and converting it into principal. If the interest is not paid on the date due, from that date the creditor is deprived of such use of the money which it would b have made if the debtor had paid the amount of interest on the date due. The creditor needs to be compensated for deprivation. As held in Pazhaniappa Mudaliar v. Narayana Ayyar 20 the fact situation is analogous to one as if the creditor has advanced money to the borrower equivalent to the amount of interest debited. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the expression \"the principal sum adjudged\" may include the amount of interest, charged on periodical rests, and capitalised with the principal sum actually advanced, so c as to become an amalgam of principal in such cases where it is permissible or obligatory for the court to hold so. Where the principal sum ( on the date of suit) has been so adjudged, the same shall be treated as \"principal sum\" for the purpose of \"such principal sum\" - the expression employed later in Section 34 CPC. The expression \"principal sum\" cannot be given different meanings at different places in the language of same section i.e. Section 34 d CPC. 45. The 1956 amendment serves a twofold purpose. Firstly, it prevents award of interest on the amount of interest so adjudged on the date of suit. Secondly, it brings the last clause of Section 34, by narrowing down its ambit, in conformity with the scope of the first clause insofar as the expression \"the principal sum adjudged\" occurring in the first part of Section e 34 is concerned which has been left untouched by amendment. The meaning to be assigned to this expression in the first part remains the same as it was even before the amendment. However, in the third part of Section 34 the words used were \"on the aggregate sum so adjudged\". The judicial opinion prevalent then was (to wit, see Prabirendra Mohan v. Berhampore Bank Ltd. 51 AIR at p. 295) that \"aggregate sum\" contemplated the aggregate of (i) f the principal sum adjudged, (ii) the interest from the date of the suit to the date of decree, and (iii) the pre-suit interest. Future interest was capable of being awarded also on the amount of pre-suit interest - adjudged as such, that is, away from such interest as was adjudged as principal sum having amalgamated into it by virtue of capitalisation. The amendment is intended to deprive the court of its pre-amendment power to award interest on interest i.e. interest on interest adjudged as such . The amendment cannot be read as g intending, expressly or by necessary implication, to deprive the court of its power to award future interest on the amount of the principal sum adjudged, the sense in which the expression was understood, also judicially expounded 20 AIR 1943 Mad 157: (1942) 2 MLJ 753 51 AIR 1954 Cal 289: 57 CWN 933 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It was submitted from the borrowers' side that such an interpretation of Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code as canvassed on behalf of the banks, if accepted, may result in anomalous situations emerging. To wit, it was pointed out that if the bank deliberately and unscrupulously delays the suit being filed, for such period of delay the bank would gain an advantage by continuing to charge interest at the contract rate and by capitalising the same . If the suit was filed promptly then the contract would cease to operate and the debtor would be relieved from the rigour of the contract and find solace under the operation of Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code. True it is that once a suit is filed in the court, so far as Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code is concerned, the relationship of parties ceases to be governed by contract between the parties and comes to be governed by Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code. Still the submission has to be repelled for several reasons. Firstly, the bank can afford to wait or delay the filing of the suit only during the period of limitation which delay would not be illegitimate. Secondly, nothing prevents the debtor, even during the period of this delay, to pay or tender the amount of interest as and when it falls due and thereby prevent its capitalisation. Thirdly, the court is not powerless to deny the bank's claim for interest, if in the facts and circumstances of a given case the court is persuaded to hold that filing of the suit was delayed for the purpose of deliberately gaining an unfair advantage over adverse financial condition of the defendant. In such cases the pre-suit interest though claimed in accordance with the contract would be denied by the court on the ground of public policy and on the ground of the creditor having tried to gain an unfair advantage over the debtor by a deliberate inaction of himself; no one can take advantage of his own wrong. 47. It was further submitted that if the expression \"the principal sum adjudged\" was to be interpreted and assigned a meaning as inclusive of the interest capitalised and therefore being the principal sum to be adjudged so at the date of the suit then there would be left nothing to be adjudged by way of interest for the pre-suit period and therefore a part of Section 34( 1) \"in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period prior to the institution of the suit\" - shall be rendered redundant. We cannot subscribe to this submission. We give just an illustration or two to demonstrate reasons for our such opinion. The same plaintiff while suing the same defendant may join in the suit more causes of action than one; one permitting capitalisation of interest, and the other, not permitting the same. There may be a case, as was Gowda case 2 decided by this Court, wherein interest is capitalised with quarterly rests on a particular date, say, 31st March and so on and the suit is filed before the date on which interest will be capitalised. The amount of interest charged for the period of time less than the quarter would remain an interest, not capitalised. Then there may be a case where interest may have been charged and capitalised at a rate exceeding the one permitted in which case the amount of interest charged and 2 (1994) s sec 213 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In all such cases the principal sum inclusive of capitalised interest to the extent permissible shall be adjudged as \"principal sum\" and there would also be \"in a addition any interest adjudged by way of interest on such principal sum\" for the pre-suit period. We therefore find force in the submission of the learned Solicitor-General that in that part of Section 34(1) which speaks of \"interest adjudged on such principal sum\" for pre-suit period, the text should be read as if by reading \"interest\" qualified by \"if any\" so as to make it meaningful. 48. It was also submitted that Section 34 CPC is general in its application b to all money suits and if banking practice or banking contracts providing for capitalisation of interest charged on periodical rests were to be recognised it will mean that application of Section 34 would be different in suits filed by banks and in suits filed by creditors other than bankers. In our opinion it is bound to be so. Section 34 is a general procedural provision and whether it would apply or not and if apply then to what extent would obviously depend on the fact situation of each case. c 49. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Corpn. Bank v. D.S. Gowda 2 and the three-Judge Bench decision in Bank of Baroda v. Jagannath Pigment & Chemicals 3 are correctly decided and are, therefore, affirmed. A creditor can charge interest from his debtor on periodical rests and also capitalise the same so as to make it a part of the principal. Such a course can be justified by stipulation in a contract d voluntarily entered into between the parties or by a practice or usage well established in the world to which the parties belong. Such practice is to be found already in vogue in the field of banking business. Such contract or usage or practice can stand abrogated by legislation such as usury laws or debt relief laws and so on. A few notes of caution SO. Though we have answered the question of law before us, but we cannot leave the matter at that alone without sounding notes of caution, lest our view of the law should be misconstrued and misapplied. Before we do so, it would be appropriate to refer to the decision of this Court in Corpn. Bank v. D.S. Gowda 2 in somewhat detail. e 51. The Banking Regulation Act, 1949 empowers the Reserve Bank, on it f being satisfied that it is necessary or expedient in the public interest or in the interest of depositors or banking policy so to do, to determine the policy in relation to advances to be followed by banking companies generally or by any banking company in particular and when the policy has been so determined it has a binding effect. In particular, the Reserve Bank of India may give directions as to the rate of interest and other terms and conditions g on which advances or other financial accommodation may be made. Such directions are also binding on every banking company. Section 35-A also empowers the Reserve Bank of India in the public interest or in the interest of banking policy or in the interests of depositors (and so on) to issue directions generally or in particular which shall be binding.

RA VIND RA ( Lahoti, J.) 401 Section 21-A has been inserted in the Act which takes away power of the court to reopen a transaction between a banking company and its debtor on a the ground that the rate of interest charged is excessive. The provision has been given an overriding effect over the Usury Loans Act, 1918 and any other provincial law in force relating to indebtedness. 52. This Court held in D.S. Gowda case 2 that the directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India have statutory flavour. The Court noted that agricultural finance stands on a different footing for the reason that b agriculturists do not have any regular source of income other than the sale proceeds of their crops and therefore agricultural loans have to be treated differently from other loans and borrowings. The Reserve Bank of India has also shown its concern towards agriculturist loanees by devising separate policy to govern them and not permitting capitalisation of accrued interest on agricultural loans except on annual rests or when the loan/instalment has become overdue. C 53. As to capitalisation of interest charged on periodical rests this Court found the High Court of Kamataka having noticed that banks in India were not following a uniform practice and some banks charged interest with monthly or quarterly rests while others charged with yearly or six-monthly rests and hence the Reserve Bank of India had to issue directives to bring about uniformity in that behalf. In conclusion this Court held that if the bank d was claiming interest in excess of that permitted by the circular/direction of the Reserve Bank, the court could give relief to the aggrieved party notwithstanding Section 21-A to the extent of interest charged in excess of the rate prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India. A distinction was drawn between the court's power to interfere on the premise that the interest charged is excessive under the general law and court's interference on the e premise that the interest charged is in contravention of the circulars/ directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India. In the former case it would not be permissible in view of the bar enacted by Section 21-A of the Banking Regulation Act while in the latter case it would be permissible because of the Reserve Bank's circulars and directions having statutory force under Sections 21/35-A of the Act having been violated. The question whether interest f charged in excess of the minimum rate of interest appointed by the Reserve Bank without fixing a ceiling and levying higher rate to be charged at the discretion of each bank can be treated as excessive and unconscionable and whether in such situation Section 21-A would debar the court from reducing the rate of interest to a reasonable limit was left open and undecided as the same did not arise in the case before the court. However it was made very g clear that if the Reserve Bank has fixed the maximum rate of interest under Sections 21/35-A of the Act any transaction charging interest within the limit so appointed would not be treated as excessive. h 54.

During the course of hearing it was brought to our notice that in view a of several usury laws and debt relief laws in force in several States private moneylending has almost come to an end and needy borrowers by and large depend on banking institutions for financial facilities. Several unhealthy practices having slowly penetrated into prevalence were pointed out. Banking is an organised institution and most of the banks press into service long- running documents wherein the borrowers fill in the blanks, at times without b caring to read what has been provided therein, and bind themselves by the stipulations articulated by the best of legal brains. Borrowers other than those belonging to the corporate sector, find themselves having unwittingly fallen into a trap and rendered themselves liable and obliged to pay interest the quantum whereof may at the end prove to be ruinous. At times the interest charged and capitalised is manifold than the amount actually advanced. Rule c of damdupat does not apply. Penal interest, service charges and other overheads are debited in the account of the borrower and capitalised of which debits the borrower may not even be aware. If the practice of charging interest on quarterly rests is upheld and given a judicial recognition, unscrupulous banks may resort to charging interest even on monthly rests and capitalising the same. Statements of accounts supplied by banks to borrowers d many a times do not contain particulars or details of debit entries and when written in hand are worse than medical prescriptions putting to test the eyes and wits of the borrowers. Instances of unscrupulous, unfair and unhealthy dealings can be multiplied though they cannot be generalised. Suffice it to observe that such issues shall have to be left open to be adjudicated upon in appropriate cases as and when actually arising for decision and we cannot e venture into laying down law on such issues as do not arise for determination before us. However, we propose to place on record a few incidental observations, without which, we feel, our answer will not be complete and that we do as under: (J) Though interest can be capitalised on the analogy that the interest falling due on the accrued date and remaining unpaid, partakes the f character of amount advanced on that date, yet penal interest, which is charged by way of penalty for non-payment, cannot be capitalised. Further interest i.e. interest on interest, whether simple, compound or penal, cannot be claimed on the amount of penal interest. Penal interest cannot be capitalised. It will be opposed to public policy. (2) Novation, that is, a debtor entering into a fresh agreement with a g creditor undertaking payment of previously borrowed principal amount coupled with interest by treating the sum total as principal, any contract express or implied and an express acknowledgement of accounts, are the best evidence of capitalisation. Acquiescence in the method of accounting adopted by the creditor and brought to the knowledge of the debtor may also enable interest being converted into principal. A mere h failure to protest is not acquiescence. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Such stipulations incorporated in contracts voluntarily entered into and binding on the parties shall govern the substantive rights and obligations of the parties as to recovery and payment of interest. ( 4) Capitalisation method is founded on the principle that the borrower failed to make payment though he could have made and thereby rendered himself a defaulter. To hold an amount debited to the account of the borrower capitalised it should appear that the borrower had an opportunity of making the payment on the date of entry or within a reasonable time or period of grace from the date of debit entry or the amount falling due and thereby avoiding capitalisation. Any debit entry in the account of the borrower and claimed to have been capitalised so as to form an amalgam of the principal sum may be excluded on being shown to the satisfaction of the court that such debit entry was not brought to the notice of the borrower and/or he did not have the opportunity of making payment before capitalisation and thereby excluding its capitalisation. (5) The power conferred by Sections 21 and 35-A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 is coupled with duty to act. The Reserve Bank of India is the prime banking institution of the country entrusted with a supervisory role over banking and conferred with the authority of issuing binding directions, having statutory force, in the interest of the public in general and preventing banking affairs from deterioration and prejudice as also to secure the proper management of any banking company generally. The Reserve Bank of India is one of the watchdogs of finance and economy of the nation. It is, and it ought to be, aware of all relevant factors, including credit conditions as prevailing, which would invite its policy decisions. RBI has been issuing directions/circulars from time to time which, inter alia, deal with the rate of interest which can be charged and the periods at the end of which rests can be struck down, interest calculated thereon and charged and capitalised. It should continue to issue such directives. Its circulars shall bind those who fall within the net of such directives. For such transaction which are not squarely governed by such circulars, the RBI directives may be treated as standards for the purpose of deciding whether the interest charged is excessive, usurious or opposed to public policy. (6) Agricultural borrowings are to be treated on a pedestal different from others. Charging and capitalisation of interest on agricultural loans cannot be permitted in India except on annual or six-monthly rests depending on the rotation of crops in the area to which the agriculturist borrowers belong. (7) Any interest charged and/or capitalised in violation of RBI directives, as to rate of interest, or as to periods at which rests can be arrived at, shall be disallowed and/or excluded from capital sum and be treated only as interest and dealt with accordingly. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The discretion shall be exercised fairly, judiciously and for reasons and not in an arbitrary or fanciful manner . b 56. In view of the law having been settled with this judgment, it is expected henceforth from the banks, bound by the directives of the Reserve Bank of India, to make an averment in the plaint that interest/compound interest has been charged at such rates, and capitalised at such periodical rests, as are permitted by, and do not run counter to, the directives of the Reserve Bank of India. A statement of account shall be filed in the court c showing details and giving particulars of debit entries, and if debit entry relates to interest then setting out also the rate of, and the period for which, the interest has been charged. On the court being prima facie satisfied, if a dispute is raised in that regard, of the permissibility of debits, the onus would be on the borrower to show why the amount of debit balance appearing at the foot of the account and claimed as principal sum cannot be so accepted and d adjudged. This practice would narrow down the scope of controversy in suits filed by banking institutions and enable an expeditious disposal of the suits, the issues wherein are by and large capable of being determined by documentary evidence.
