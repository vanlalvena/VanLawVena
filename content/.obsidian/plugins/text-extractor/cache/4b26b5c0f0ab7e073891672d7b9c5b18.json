We are of the view ;hat the High Court was wrong in holding that the adjustment of the decree cctween the judgment-debtor and the transferor decree-holder even after notice of the application under Order 21, rule 16 had been served on the transferor and the judgment-debtor barred execution of the decree by the tranS!€'ree. Th€' question whether there was any transfer of the decree under the deed of assi~ument was not decided by the High Court and we, therefore, allow the appeal and remit the matter to the High Court for decision upon this question only.

Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. run a hotel in which besides providing lodging and meals to residents it also operates a restaurant where meals are served to non-residems or casual visitors. In a reforence made to the High Court of Delhi under Section :l l (3) of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 as extended to the Union Territory of DeUu, the High Court expressed the opinion that the service of meals to casual visitors in the restaurant was taxable as a sale. On appeal, this Court took a contrary view and held that when meals were served to casual visitor:. in the restaurant operated by the appellant the service must be regarded as providmg for the satisfac,t1on of a human need and could not be regarded as constituting a sale of food when all that the visitors were entitled to do was to eat the food served to them and were not entitled to remove or carry away uneaten food. Supporting considerations included the circumSLance that the furniture and furnishings, linen, crockery and cutlery were provided. and there was also music, dancing and perhaps a floor show. 3. M.f. Soli J. Sorabjee, the learned Additional Solicitor-General, who has been briefed by the respondent to appear at this stage in the case has, with his usual thowughness and ability, succeeded in putting together a mass of legal material which we greatly wish had been before the Court when the appeals were originally heard. On the basis of that material, he submits that the judgment delivered by this Court ought to be reviewed. We have no hesitation in saying that had this material been available earlier, it would have enabled the Court to consider still further aspects of the problem and examine it more comprehensively. But having regard to the basis on which the appeals proceeded., we are unable to say that the result would necessarily have been different. 4. The learned Additional Solicitor-General contended that the judg- ment of this Court 1s amenable to review because, he says, iL proceeds on the erroneous assumption that a restaurant can, foT the puTposes of the point of law decided by us, be likened to an inn. We have been referreo to Halsbury's Laws of England 1 and the Hotel Proprietors Act, 1956 mentioned therein. Our attention has also been invited to a statement in Benjamin's \"Sale of Goods\" 2 that when a meal is served to a customer in a restaurant there is a sal, of goods, the element of service being subsidiary. As regards judicial upinion in England, reliance has bet·n placed on Rex v. Wood Gr,en Profiteering Commillee-Ex p. Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd. 3 ; Rex v. Birmingham Profttemng Commi\"ee-Ex p. Provincial Cinematograph Theatres, Ltd. 4 and Lockett v. A. & M. Charles Ltd. 6 • It appears, howeve1, that the first and third of Lhese three cases cannot be said to bear direcdy on the point. It was also urged that Merrill v. Hodson 8 and A1ary Ni.sky v. Childs Company\"', on which this Court r0lied, represent the Connecticut-New Jersey rule, but the opposite view embodied iu the Massachusetts-N0w York rule and expressed m Friend v. Childs Dining Hall Co. 8 represents th,:- true law. It was said that the subsequent enactment of the Uniform Commcr~ial Code9 in the United States has prt:'ferrt:d the Massachusetts-New York rule \"by providing that for th e purpose of the implied warranty of merchantibility, the serving for value of food or drink to be consumed either on the premt!ies 1. 21 Hals 3rd Edn 441-42 2. 1974 Edn p 37 para 39 3.

C. T. 0 .11 for the proposition that the concept of ''salt of goods\" as understood in the legislative entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule of our constitutional enactment should be enlarged to take into account a meaning not intended earlier but necessitated by an environment of social control measures. Finally, reference has been made to certain observations m ~tau of Punjab v. Mjs. Associated Hotels of India Ltd. 12 and Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Ltumi Narain T andonl-1 • 5. Learned counsel for the intervener States generally adopted the submissions of the learned Additional Solicitor-General. 6. The review petitions have been vigorously opposed by Mr. F. S. Nariman, appearing for the appellant, who has urged that no ground for review has been made out and that, in any event, the judgment of this Court does not suffer from error. He pointed out that the decisions based on the Massachusetts-New York rule holding that the service of meals to customers in a restaurant constitutes a sale of food turned on the need for importing an implied warranty that the food was fit for eating. That consi- deration, it was said, need not influence the courts in India because the lacuna had been filled by law such as the Food Adulteration Act aimed at ensuring the supply of wholesome f<.,od to consumers. The submission is that whether the service of meals is or is not a sale must be determined by the nature of the transaction and not by the need to import an implied warranty of titness. In other words, it is said, the factor of implied warranty must follow on the transaction being a sale and not that the transaction is a sale because an implied warranty is a necessary guarantee for public health. We are reminded that the true basis of our judgment is that no tule in the food passes to the consumer as is evidenced by the circum~tance that the unconsumed portion of the food cannot be carried away by him. 1t is pointed out that there never was any dispute by the respondent that a customer in a restaurant who orders food for consumption by him on the premises is not entitled to take away the unconsumed portion of the food. The essential nature of the transaction, he reiterates, is that it is a service afforded for the satisfaction of a bodily need, and the service is provided by suppl}ing food for eating. In the end, he has emphasised the limited scope of the power of review and the strict conditions m which it can be invoked. Dr. Y. S. Chitale and Mr. Anil Divan, appearing for some interveners, adopt the same line of argument. 7. The question is whether on the facts of the present case a review is jmtified. 6. It is well settled that a party is not entitled to seek a review of a judgment delivered by this Court mcrdy for the purpcse of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the case. The normal principle is that a judgmi>nt pronounced by the Court is_ fined, and departure from that principle is justified only when circumstanns of d. substantial and compelling character make it necessary to do so; Sajjan Si11gh v. State of Rajasthan1'. For instance, if the attention of the Court is not drawn to a material statutory provision \\0. G1 Am Jur '2d G33 § ~G~ 11.

Mthta11• The Court may also reopen its judgment if a manifest wrong has been done and it is necessary to pass an order to do full and effective justice: 0. N. Afohindroo v. Disll. Judge, Dellu18 • Power to review its jud_ments has been conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 137 of the Constitution, and that power is subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament or the rules made under Article 145. In a civil proceeding, an application for review is entertained only on a ground mentioned in Order 47 Rule I of the Code of Civil Procedure, and in a criminal proceeding on the ground of an error apparent on the face of the record (Order XL, Rule l, Supreme Court Rules, 1966). But whatever the nature of the proceeding, it is beyond dispute that a review proceeding cannot be equated with the original hearing of the case, and the finality of the judgment delivered by the Court will not be reconsidered except ''where a glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility\": Sow Chandra Kame v. Sluik/a Habib17• 9. Now, besides the fact that most of the legal material so assiduously collected and placed before u1 by the learned Additional Solicitor-General. who has now been entrusted to appear for the respondent, was never brought to our attention when the appeals were beard, we may also examine whether the judgment suffers from an error apparent on the face of the record. Such an error exists if of two or more views canvassed on the point it is possible to hold that the controversy can be said to admit of only one of them. If the view adopted by the Court in the original judgment is a possible view having regard to what the record states, it is difficult to hold that there is an error apparent on the face of the record. 10. What were the considerations on which this Court held that the transaction was not a sale? The Court said, and this was emphasised in no small degree, that the supply and service of food to a customer to be eaten in the restaurant was not a sale for the reason that he was merely entitled to eat the food served to him and not to remove and carry away the uncon- sumed portion of the food. Had that amounted to a sale, the unconsumed portion would have belonged to the customer to take away and dispose of as he pleased. Besides, the Court noted, there were other amenitif's and services of considerable mar~riality which were also provided. That was the case set up by the appellant before the assessing, appellate and revisional authorities, and it was apparently also the case pleaded before the High Court. It was summarised thus in the petition under Article 136(1) of the Constitution filed in this Court: (1) The Hotelier and Catering industry is a service-oriented industry unlike and as distinguished from other sale-oriented industries. The purpose of a Hotelier and Caterer is not to sell food, but to serv~ it in proper atmosphere so as to make the service and consumption of food enjoyable for the gu,-sts. In the dining hall, the petitioner provided certain basic facilities and amenities, such as, airconditioning services, music, facilities for dancing (i.e. dancing floor) specially designed crockery, special lighting, etc. The petitioner had built up a reputation for providing the aforesaid services and people patronise the dining halls as a result of these amenities. 15.

(2) Though the customer pays for thP food, he can enjoy only that much of food as can be consumed by him at one particular timP. The guest is not entitled to carry away the unconsumed portion of his food. There ic; thus no passing of property for a ~tipufated money considera- ti<in, which would imply the guest's right to carry away the unconsumt•d portion of his food. (3) The amount received by thP petitioner is not the price of any goods. On the other hand, it repres<'nts the p£>titioner'c; charges for looking after the convenience and Pnjoyment of the cn.,tomer inr-!udin~ his need for food and rendering him various kinds of other servires and providing him with various facilities and comforts. 11. The appellant prepared and served food both to rrsidents in its hotel as \\\\/ell as to casual customers who came to eat in its restaurant, and throughout it maintained that having regard to the nature of the services rendered there was no real difference between the two kinds of transactiom. In both cases it remained a supply and service of food not amounting to a sale. It is important to note that the facts alleged by the appellant wt>re never disputed at any stage, and we find no attempt by the taxing authorities to enquire into the truth of the facts so a~sPrted. It is in that factual context that this Court examined the question whether any liability to sales tax was attracted. Our jud~ment rests on that factual foundation, and must be understood in that light. 12. It appears from the submissions now 1:0adl\" that the respondent as well as other StatPs arc- apprehensive that the benefit of the judgment of this Court will be invokPd by restaurant-owners in those cases also whPre thPre is a sale of food and title passes to the customers. It seems to us that having r£>gard to the facts upon which our judgment rests-undisputed as they have rPmained throughout the diff Prent stages of the litigation-and the considera- tions which they attract, no such apprehension can be reasonably entertained. Indeed, we have no hesitation in saying that where food is supplied in an eating-house or restaurant, and it is established upon the facts that the substance of the transaction, evidenced by its dominant object, is a sale of food and the rendering of services is merely incidental, the transaction would ·undoubtedly be exigible to sales tax. In every case it will be for the taxing authority to ascertain the facts when making an assessment under the relevant sales tax law and to determine upon those facts whether a sale of the food supplied is intended. 13. We are of the view that these review petitions must fail. Tht>y are. accordingly, dismissed. There is no order as to costs. Kri■bna Iyer, J.

Here, the factual setting in which thr decision is founded becomes critical My learnt>d brother has made it perf Pcdy plain that the appeal proceedf'd on thP admitted footing that the visitor to the restaurart who sat at the table and was ,erved the dishes he desired had, in that case, no right to carry home what he wanted. after eating what he wanted, and to pay for the eatables as distinguishPd from the total blend of services, including supply (not sale) of what he chose to eat. The basic, indeed dPcisive, assumption was that victuals , as Juck, were not sold and the consideration was for thP complPx of activities which included eating and drinking. This sophisticated situation bPing granted, the conclusion is impeccable. But if circumstances differ the decision too will be different. But no alternative situations were presented. If counsel dPfaults in the submission, he cannot find fault with the court for the decision. This is the long and short of it. 16. It sometimes happens that high-style restaurants or residential hotels render a bundle of speciaJ servicPs like ball danrr, rare music, hot drinks, 'viands of high regale', glittering crockery, regal attPntion or 'bikini' service and even sight-seeing transport or round-the-city visits, shoP-~hi11ing, air-conditioning, massage in the room etc., on a consolidatPd sum. Y,,u cannot dissect the items or decode the bill to discover separately the com- ponent of goods sold. This situation may obtain evPn in India with th<> throng of foreign tourists who want to be taken care of and pay all-inclusively. This may happen in some fashionable restaurants where you cannot, as of right, rrmove from the table what is left over. In. these cases thr decision under review squarely applies. My learned brother has clarified and confined the ratio to the contours so set out. He has also pointed out that counsel, at the earlier hearing, did not contest this factual matrix. A rPview in counsel's mentation cannot repair the verdict once given. So the law laid down must rest in peace. 17. The learned Solicitor-General took us through Engfo;h and American legal literature of vintage value and alien milieu. They enlightened us but did not apply fully, as PXplained by my learned brother Had they bef•n earlier cited they would have been seriously considered. But India is India. It lives in its one lakh villages, thousands of towns, millions of pavement pedlars and wayside victuallers, corner coffee shops and tea stalls, eating houses -and restaurants and some top-notch parlours. Habits vary, conven- tions differ and one rigid rule cannot apply in diverse situations. If you go to a coffee house, order two dosas, eat one and carry the other home, you buy the dosas. You may keep the cake and eat it too, like a child who bites a part and tells daddy that he would eat the rest at home. Myriad situations, where the transaction is a sale of a meal, or item to eat or part of a package of service plus must not be governed bv standard rule. In mere restaurants and non-residential hotels, many of these transactions are sales and taxable. Nor are additional services invariably components of what you p,v for. You may go to an air-conditioned cloth-shop or sweet- meat stores or handicrafts emporium where cups of tea may be ~iven, dainty damsels may serve or sensuous magazines kept for,reading. They are devices to attract customers who buy the commodity and the price paid is taxable as sale. The substance of the transaction, the dominant obj,,ct, the life-style and other telling factors must determine whether the apparent vendor did sell the goods or only supply a package of servicPs. Was there a right to take away any eatable served, whether it be bad manners to do so or not?

RAJ KAPOOR Appt>llant ; Versus LAXM.\\N Respondent, Criminal Appeal No. 773 of 1979t, decided on December 14, 1979 Penal Code, 1860 - Sections 292 and 79 'Justified by law, - ~A• certificate issued by the Board of' Censors under the special provisions of Section 5-A of the Cinematograph Act, held, is a justi- fication in law within Section 79 £or public display of the &Im and a subsequent prosecution under Section 292 is liable to be quashed - Cinematograph Act, 1952, Section 5-A (lA) C.inematograph Act, 1952 - Section 5-B - Duty of Board of Censors in issuing certificate under - Constitution of India, Article 19(2) Statute Law - Where a special statute is operative, the general statute is to give way - Interpretation of Statutes - General and Special Acts A complaint (or an offence under Section 292, IPC was lodged against the producer, actor, photog-rapher,exhibiter and distributor of the film Satyam Shivam Sundaram. The Magistrate after examining some witnesses took cogni- zance of the offence and issued notice to the accused. The producer-appellant thereupon moved the High Court under Section 482, CrPC for quashing the proceedings on the ground that the film had been duly given •A• certi- ficate by the Central Board of Film Censors under the Cinematograph Act for its exhibition. The High Court having declined to quash the proceed- ings, the present appeal has been brought before the Supreme Court con- tending that the film having been certified undt>r the said Act, he was absolved in law undn Section 79, JPC in exhibiting it to the public. Allowing the appeal, the Supr.eme Court Held: An act is justified by law if it is warrantPd, validated and made blamt•- le~s by law.
