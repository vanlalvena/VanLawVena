It is one of the settled principles of a civilised legal system that a Judge is required to be impartial. It is said that the hallmark of a democracy is the existence of an impartial Judge. The principles that are applicable to determine whether the impartiality of a Judge is sufficiently in doubt so as to warrant recusal can be summarised as follows: (i) If a Judge has a financial interest in the outcome of a case, he is automatically disqualified from hearing the case. (ii) In cases where the interest of the Judge in the case is other than financial, then the disqualification is not automatic but an enquiry is required whether the existence of such an interest disqualifies the Judge tested in the light of either on the principle of \"real danger\" or \"reasonable apprehension\" of bias. (iii) Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2), (2000) 1 AC 119 added a new category i.e. that the Judge is automatically disqualified from hearing a case where the Judge is interested in a cause which is being promoted by one of the parties to the case. It is nobody's case that, in the case at hand, Khehar, J. had any pecuniary interest or any other interest falling under the second of the abovementioned categories. By the very nature of the case, no such interest can arise at all. (Paras 10, 25.1 to 25.3 and 26) The question is whether the principle of law laid down in Pinochet case is attracted. In other words, whether Khehar, J. can be said to be sharing any interest which one of the parties is promoting. All the parties to these proceedings claim to be promoting the cause of ensuring the existence of an impartial and independent judiciary. The only difference of opinion between the parties is regarding the process by which such a result is to be achieved. Therefore, it cannot be said that Khehar, J. shares any interest which any one of the parties to the proceeding is seeking to promote. (Para 27) Dimes v.

Grant Hammond: Judicial Recusal: Principles, Process and Problems (Hart Publishing, 2009) , considered The objection that was raised to Khehar, J. being a member of this Bench was that as he was a member of the 4 + 1 Collegium, he had vested in him \"significant constitutional power\" under the existing Collegium System of appointment of Judges in the matter of selection of Judges of the Supreme Court as well as High Courts of this country and by virtue of the impugned legislation which replaces the Collegium System, until he attains the position of being the third seniormost Judge of the Supreme Court, Khehar, J. would cease to enjoy such power; and therefore, there is a possibility of him not being impartial. That is to say the petitioners who are seeking to have the Collegium System retained (and not the respondents) objected to the participation of Khehar, J. in these proceedings on the ground of him having conflicting interests - one in his capacity as member of the Collegium and the other in his capacity as a Judge to examine the constitutional validity of the provisions which seek to displace the Collegium system. (Paras 2 and 9) The implication of the petitioners' submission is that Khehar, J. would be predetermined to hold the impugned legislation to be invalid. If such apprehension of the petitioners comes true, the beneficiaries would be the petitioners only. The grievance, if any, on this ground should be on the part of the respondents . The respondents made an emphatic statement that they have no objection for Khehar, J. hearing the matter as a Presiding Judge of the Bench. (Paras 28 and 29) No precedent has been cited where courts ruled at the instance of the beneficiary of bias on the part of the adjudicator, that a judgment or an administrative decision is either voidable or void on the ground of bias. On the other hand, it is a well-established principle of law that an objection based on bias of the adjudicator can be waived. Courts generally do not entertain such objection raised belatedly by the aggrieved party: the right to object to a disqualified adjudicator may be waived, and this may be so even where the disqualification is statutory. The court normally insists that the objection shall be taken as soon as the party prejudiced knows the facts which entitle him to object. If, after he or his advisors know of the disqualification, they let the proceedings continue without protest, they are held to have waived their objection and the determination cannot be challenged. The implication of the above principle is that only a party who has suffered or is likely to suffer an adverse adjudication because of the possibility of bias on the part of the adjudicator, can raise the objection.

Thus, this argument if accepted would render all the Judges of the Supreme Court disqualified from hearing the present controversy. A result not legally permitted by the \"doctrine of necessity\". Hence, the submission that Khehar, J. should recuse himself from the proceedings, is rejected. (Paras 2, 31 and 32) Per Khehar, J. In the Supreme Court one gets used to writing common orders, for orders are written either on behalf of the Bench, or on behalf of the Court. Mostly, dissents are written in the first person. Even though this is not an order in the nature of a dissent, yet it needs to be written in the first person. While endorsing the opinion expressed by Chelameswar, J., adjudicating upon the prayer for my recusal from hearing the matters in hand, reasons for my continuation on the Bench also need to be expressed by me. Not for advocating any principle of law, but for laying down certain principles of conduct. (Para 33) A three-Judge Bench was originally constituted for hearing these matters. The Bench comprised of Anil R. Dave, J. Chelameswar and Madan B. Lokur, JJ. At that juncture, Anil R. Dave, J. was a part of the 1 + 2 Collegium, as also, the 1 + 4 Collegium. During the hearing of the cases, Anil R. Dave, J. did not participate in any Collegium proceedings. Based on the order passed by the three-Judge Bench hearing these matters on 7-4-2015, the Chief Justice of India, constituted a five- Judge Bench, comprising of Anil R. Dave, J. Chelameswar, Madan B. Lokur, Kurian Joseph and Adarsh Kumar Goel, JJ. (Paras 35, 41 and 42) On 13-4-2015, the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014, and the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014, were notified in the Gazette of India (Extraordinary). Both the above enactments were brought into force with effect from 13-4-2015. Accordingly, on 13-4-2015 Anil R. Dave, J. became an ex officio Member of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, on account of being the second seniormost Judge after the Chief Justice of India, under the mandate of Article 124-A(l)(b) as inserted by the said amendment. When the matter came up for hearing for the first time before the said five-Judge Bench on 15-4-2015, Dave, J. recused himself as a prayer was made in that regard. It is, therefore, that the Chief Justice of India, reconstituted the Bench with myself, J. Chelameswar, Madan B. Lokur, Kurian Joseph and Adarsh Kumar Goel, JJ., to hear this group of cases. (Paras 43 and 44) The sequence of facts reveals that the recusal by Anil R. Dave, J. was not at his own, but in deference to a similar prayer made to him. Logically, if he had heard these cases when he was the Presiding Judge of the three-Judge Bench, he would have heard it, when the Bench strength was increased to five, wherein, he was still the Presiding Judge.

Ltd. ~cccc® ION LINE;:' True Prinf a b C d e f g h SUPREME COURT ADVOCATES-ON-RECORD ASSN. v. UNION 813 OF INDIA (RECUSAL MATTER) (In HN - Per Khehar, J.) It was, and still is, my personal view, which I do not wish to thrust upon anyone, that Anil R. Dave, J. was amongst the most suited to preside over the reconstituted Bench. As noticed above, he was a part of the 1 + 2 Collegium, as also, the 1 + 4 Collegium, under the \"Collegium system\"; he would continue to discharge the same responsibilities, as an ex officio Member of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, in the \"Commission system\", under the constitutional amendment enforced with effect from 13-4-2015. Therefore, irrespective of the system which would survive the adjudicatory process, Anil R. Dave, J. would participate in the selection, appointment and transfer of Judges of the higher judiciary. He would, therefore, not be affected by the determination of the present controversy, one way or the other. (Paras 48 and 49) As a Judge presiding over the reconstituted Bench, I found myself in an awkward predicament. I had no personal desire to participate in the hearing of these matters. I was a part of the Bench because of my nomination to it by the Chief Justice of India. My recusal from the Bench at the asking of the esteemed members of the Bar did not need a second thought. But then, this was the second occasion when proceedings in a matter would have been deferred, just because the Chief Justice of India, in the first instance, had nominated Anil R. Dave, J. on the Bench, and thereafter, had substituted him by nominating me to the Bench. It is, therefore, felt that reasons ought to be recorded after hearing the learned counsel, at least for the guidance of the Chief Justice of India, so that his Lordship may not make another nomination to the Bench which may be similarly objected to. This, coupled with the submissions advanced by other learned members of the Bar that parameters should be laid down, led to a hearing on the issue of recusal. (Paras 52 and 53) Thus, the Bench examined the prayer, whether I should remain on the reconstituted Bench, despite my being a member of the 1 + 4 Collegium. The Bench unanimously concluded that there was no conflict of interest, and no other justifiable reason in law, for me to recuse myself from the hearing of these matters. The Bench passed a short order to this effect. After the order was pronounced, I disclosed to my colleagues on the Bench that I was still undecided whether I should remain on the Bench, for I was toying with the idea of recusal, because a prayer to that effect had been made in the face of the Court. My colleagues on the Bench would have nothing of it. They were unequivocal in their protestation. Despite the factual position noticed above, I wish to record that it is not their persuasion or exhortation which made me take a final call on the matter. The decision to remain a member of the reconstituted Bench was mine, and mine alone. The choice that I made, was not of the heart, but that of the head. The choice was made by posing two questions to myself. Firstly, whether a Judge hearing a matter should recuse himself, even though the prayer for recusal is found to be unjustified and unwarranted? Secondly, whether I would stand true to the oath of my office, if I recused myself from hearing the matters? (Paras 54 to 56) The reason that was pointed out against me, for seeking my recusal was, that I was a part of the 1 + 4 Collegium. But that should have been a disqualification for Anil R. Dave, J. as well. When he commenced hearing of the matters, and till 7-4-2015, he suffered the same alleged disqualification. Yet, the objection raised ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd. ~cccc® ION LINE;:' True Prinf 814 SUPREME COURT CASES (2016) s sec against me, was not raised against him. One wonders, why did the petitioners not seek the recusal of Anil R. Dave, J. on this ground? There is no doubt about the fact, that I have been a member of the 1 + 4 Collegium, and it is likely that I would also shortly become a Member of NJAC, if the present challenge raised by the petitioners was not to succeed. I would, therefore, remain a part of the selection procedure, irrespective of the process which prevails. That, however, is the position with reference to four of us (on the instant five-Judge Bench). Besides me, my colleagues on the Bench - J. Chelameswar, Madan B. Lokur and Kurian Joseph, JJ. would in due course be a part of the Collegium (if the writ petitioners before the Supreme Court were to succeed), or alternatively, would be a part of NJAC (if the writ petitioners were to fail). In such eventuality, the averment of conflict of interest, ought to have been raised not only against me, but also against my three colleagues. But, that was not the manner in which the issue has been canvassed. Thus, the prayer for my recusal is not well founded. If I were to accede to the prayer for my recusal, I would be initiating a wrong practice, and laying down a wrong precedent. A Judge may recuse himself at his own from a case entrusted to him by the Chief Justice. That would be a matter of his own choosing. But recusal at the asking of a litigating party, unless justified, must never be acceded to. For that would give the impression that the Judge had been scared out of the case, just by the force of the objection. A Judge before he assumes his office, takes an oath to discharge his duties without fear or favour. He would breach his oath of office, if he accepts a prayer for recusal, unless justified. It is my duty to discharge my responsibility with absolute earnestness and sincerity. It is my duty to abide by my oath of office to uphold the Constitution and the laws. My decision to continue to be a part of the Bench, flows from the oath which I took at the time of my elevation to the Supreme Court. (Para 57) Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India, WP (C) No. 13 of 2015, order dated 18-3-2015 (SC); Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India, WP (C) No. 13 of 2015, order dated 24-3-2015 (SC); Mathews J.

Bank of Cochin, (1980) 2 SCC 360 , cited Per Lokur, J. When an application is made for the recusal of a Judge from hearing a case, the application is made to the Judge concerned and not to the Bench as a whole. Therefore, my learned Brother Khehar, J. is absolutely correct in stating that the decision is entirely his, and I respect his decision. (Para 60) The issue of recusal may be looked at slightly differently apart from the legal nuance. What would happen if, in a Bench of five Judges, an application is moved for the recusal of Judge A and after hearing the application, Judge A decides to recuse himself from the case but the other four Judges disagree and express the opinion that there is no justifiable reason for Judge A to recuse himself from the hearing? Can Judge A be compelled to hear the case even though he/she is desirous of recusing from the hearing? It is to get over such a difficult situation that the application for recusal is actually to an individual Judge and not the Bench as a whole. (Para 63) Court on its Own Motion v.

Local No. 6167, United Mine Workers of America, 1945 SCC OnLine US SC 133 : 89 L Ed 2007: 325 US 897 (1945); Hanrahan v. Hampton, 1980 SCC OnLine US SC 81 : 64 L Ed 2d 214: 446 US 1301 (1980), relied on As far as the view expressed by Kurian Joseph, J. that reasons should be given while deciding an application for recusal, I would prefer not to join that decision. In the first place, giving or not giving reasons was not an issue before this Bench. That reasons are presently being given is a different matter altogether. Secondly, the giving of reasons is fraught with some difficulties. For example, it is possible that in a given case, a learned Judge of the High Court accepts an application for his/ her recusal from a case and one of the parties challenges that order in the Supreme Court. Upon hearing the parties, the Supreme Court comes to the conclusion that the reasons given by the learned Judge were frivolous and therefore the order is incorrect and is then set aside. In such an event, can the Supreme Court pass a consequential order requiring the learned Judge to hear the case even though he/ she genuinely believes that he/she should not hear the case? (Para 64) The issue of recusal from hearing a case is not as simple as it appears. The questions thrown up are quite significant and since it appears that such applications are gaining frequency, it is time that some procedural and substantive rules are framed in this regard. If appropriate rules are framed, then, in a given case, it would avoid embarrassment to other Judges on the Bench. (Para 65) Per Kurian, J. One of the reasons for recusal of a Judge is that litigants/the public might entertain a reasonable apprehension about his impartiality. It is not merely of some importance but is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done. And therefore, in order to uphold the credibility of the integrity institution, the Judge recuses himself from hearing the case. (Para 67) Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a Judge, they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour. It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of disqualification is a reasonable apprehension that the judicial officer will not decide the case impartially or without prejudice, rather than that he will decide the case adversely to one party. (Para 74) The nature of the judicial function involves the performance of difficult and at times unpleasant tasks. Judicial officers are nonetheless required to \"administer justice to all persons alike without fear, favour or prejudice, in accordance with the Constitution and the law\". To this end they must resist all manner of pressure, regardless of where it comes from. This is the constitutional duty common to all judicial officers.

No doubt, these examples are not exhaustive. (Paras 68 and 69) Guidelines on the ethical conduct of the Judges were formulated in the Chief Justices' Conference held in 1999 known as \"Restatement of Judicial Values of Judicial Life\". Those principles, as a matter of fact, formed the basis of \"the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, 2002\" formulated at the Round Table Meeting of Chief Justices held at the Peace Palace, The Hague. (Para 70) The simple question which is always to be asked is, whether the adjudication by the Judge concerned, would cause a reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonably informed litigant and fair-minded public, on correct facts, as to his impartiality or raise the likelihood of bias. Mere possibility of such a feeling is not enough. There must exist circumstances where a reasonable and fair-minded man would think it probable or likely that the Judge would be prejudiced against a litigant. There may be situations where mischievous litigants wanting to avoid a Judge may be because he is known to them to be very strong and thus making an attempt for forum shopping by raising baseless submissions on conflict of interest. The reasonableness of the apprehension must be assessed in the light of the oath of office he has taken as a Judge to administer justice without fear or favour, affection or ill will and his ability to carry out the oath by reason of his training and experience whereby he is in a position to disabuse his mind of any irrelevant personal belief or predisposition or unwarranted apprehensions of his image in public or difficulty in deciding a controversial issue, particularly when the same is highly sensitive. (Paras 71 and 73 to 75) Being an institution whose hallmark is transparency, it is only proper that the Judge discharging high and noble duties, at least broadly indicate the reasons for recusing from the case so that the litigants or the well-meaning public may not entertain any misunderstanding that the recusal was for altogether irrelevant reasons like the cases being very old, involving detailed consideration, decision on several questions of law, a situation where the Judge is not happy with the roster, a Judge getting unduly sensitive about the public perception of his image, a Judge wanting not to cause displeasure to anybody, a Judge always wanting not to decide any sensitive or controversial issues, etc . Once reasons for recusal are indicated, there will not be any room for attributing any motive for the recusal.

This would help to curb the tendency for forum shopping. (Para 71) The above principles are universal in application. Impartiality of a Judge is the sine qua non for the integrity institution. Transparency in procedure is one of the major factors constituting the integrity of the office of a Judge in conducting his duties and the functioning of the court. The litigants would always like to know though they may not have a prescribed right to know, as to why a Judge has recused from hearing the case or despite request, has not recused to hear his case. Reasons are required to be indicated broadly. Of course, in case the disclosure of the reasons is likely to affect prejudicially any case or cause or interest of someone else, the Judge is free to state that on account of personal reasons which the Judge does not want to disclose, he has decided to recuse himself from hearing the case.

(for himself and Goel, J.)- Very important and far-reaching questions fall for the consideration of this Court in this batch of matters. The constitutional validity of the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 and the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 are under challenge. 2. When these matters were listed for preliminary hearing on 21-4-2015, an objection was raised by Shri Fali S. N ariman, learned Senior Counsel appearing for one of the petitioners, that it is inappropriate for Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar to participate in the proceedings as the Presiding Judge of this Bench. The objection is predicated on the facts: being the third seniormost puisne Judge of this Court, Justice Khehar is a member of the Collegium propounded under the Second Judges case 1 exercising \"significant constitutional power\" in the matter of selection of Judges of this Court as well as High Courts of this country; by virtue of the impugned legislation, until he attains the position of being the third seniormost Judge of this Court, Justice Khehar would cease to enjoy such power; and therefore, there is a possibility of him not being impartial. 3. When the objection was raised, various counsel appearing on behalf of either side expressed different viewpoints regarding the appropriateness of participation of Justice Khehar in these proceedings. We, therefore, called upon the learned counsel appearing in this matter to precisely state their respective points of view on the question and assist the Court in identifying principles of law which are relevant to arrive at the right answer to the objection raised by Shri Fali S. Nariman. * Ed.: Chelameswar, J. delivered the leading opinion of the Court for himself and Goel, J. Khehar , Lokur and Kurian, JJ. delivered separate opinions concurring with Chelameswar, J.

The matter was listed again on 22-4-2015 on which date Shri Nariman filed a brief written statement 2 indicating reasons which according to him make it inappropriate for Justice Khehar to preside over the present Bench. 5. On the other hand, Shri Arvind P. Datar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for one of the petitioners made elaborate submissions explaining the legal principles which require a Judge to recuse himself from hearing a particular case and submitted that in the light of settled principles of law in this regard there is neither impropriety in Justice Khehar hearing these matters nor any need for him to do so. 6. Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned Attorney General very vehemently opposed the suggestion of Shri Nariman and submitted that there is nothing in law which demands the recusal of Justice Khehar nor has the Union of India any objection to Justice Khehar hearing these batch of matters. 7. Shri Harish N. Salve and Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel who proposed to appear on behalf of different States also supported the stand of the learned Attorney General and made independent submissions in support of the conclusion. 8. After an elaborate hearing of the matter, we came to the unanimous conclusion that there is no principle of law which warrants Justice Khehar' s recusal from the proceedings. We recorded the conclusion of the Bench in the proceedings dated 22-4-2015 3 and indicated that because of paucity of time, the reasons for the conclusion would follow later 33 . 9. At the outset, we must record that each of the learned counsel who objected to the participation of Justice Khehar in these proceedings anchored this objection on distinct propositions of law. While Shri N ariman put it on the ground of inappropriateness, Shri Santosh Paul invoked the principle of bias, 2 The position of the Presiding Judge on this Bench hearing these cases of constitutional challenge is not consistent with (and apparently conflicts with) his position as a member of the \"Collegium\"; and is likely to be seen as such; always bearing in mind that if the Constitution Amendment and the statute pertaining thereto are held constitutionally valid and are upheld, the present Presiding Judge would no longer be part of the Collegium-the Collegium, it must be acknowledged exercises significant constitutional power. 3 Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India, (2015) 6 sec 408, 410 (paras 12-17). \"12. A preliminary objection, whether Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar should preside over this Bench, by virtue of his being the fourth seniormost Judge of this Court, also happens to be a member of the Collegium, was raised by the petitioners. Elaborate submissions were made by the learned counsel for the petitioners and the respondents. After hearing all the learned counsel, we are of the unanimous opinion that we do not see any reason in law requiring Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar to recuse himself from hearing the matter. Reasons will follow. 13.

In substance, some of the petitioners are of the opinion that Justice Khehar should recuse 4 . 10. It is one of the settled principles of a civilised legal system that a Judge is required to be impartial. It is said that the hallmark of a democracy is the existence of an impartial Judge. 11. It all started with a Latin maxim nemo judex in re sua which means literally-that no man shall be a judge in his own cause. There is another rule which requires a Judge to be impartial. The theoretical basis is explained by Thomas Hobbes in his Eleventh Law of Nature. He said: \"If a man be trusted to judge between man and man, it is a precept of the law of Nature that he deal equally between them. For without that, the controversies of men cannot be determined but by war. He, therefore, that is partial in judgment doth what in him lies, to deter men from the use of judges and arbitrators; and consequently, against the fundamental law of Nature, is the cause of war.\" 12. Grant Hammond, a former Judge of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand and an academician, in his book titled Judicial Recusal 5 traced out principles on the law of recusal as developed in England in the following words: \"The central feature of the early English common law on recusal was both simple and highly constrained: a Judge could only be disqualified for a direct pecuniary interest. What would today be termed 'bias', which is easily the most controversial ground for disqualification, was entirely rejected as a ground for recusal of Judges, although it was not completely dismissed in relation to jurors. This was in marked contrast to the relatively sophisticated canon law, which provided for recusal if a Judge was suspected of partiality because of consanguinity, affinity, friendship or enmity with a party, or because of his subordinate status towards a party or because he was or had been a party's advocate.\" He also pointed out that in contrast in the United States of America, the subject is covered by legislation. 13. Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal 6 , is one of the earliest cases where the g question of disqualification of a Judge was considered. The ground was that he 4 The expression \"recuse\" according to New Oxford English Dictionary means - (the act of a Judge) to excuse himself from a case because of possible conflict of h interest for lack of impartiality. 5 R.

We are not concerned with the details of the dispute between the parties to the case. Lord Chancellor Cottenham heard the appeal against an order of the Vice-Chancellor and confirmed the a order. The order went in favour of the defendant Company. A year later, Dimes discovered that Lord Chancellor Cottenham had shares in the defendant Company. He petitioned the Queen for her intervention. The litigation had a long and chequered history, the details of which are not material for us. Eventually, the matter reached the House of Lords. The House dismissed the appeal of Dimes on the ground that setting aside of the order of the Lord b Chancellor would still leave the order of the Vice-Chancellor intact as Lord Chancellor had merely affirmed the order of the Vice-Chancellor. However, the House of Lords held that participation of Lord Cottenham in the adjudicatory process was not justified. Though Lord Campbell observed: (Dimes case 6 , ER p. 315) \" ... No on e can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be, in the remotest degree, influenced by the interest he had in this concern: but, my Lords, it is of the last importance that the maxim that no man is to be a Judge in his own cause should be held sacred. And that is not to be confined to a cause in which he is a party, but applies to a cause in which he has an interest . . . . This will be a lesson to all inferior tribunals to take care not only that in their decrees they are not influenced by their personal interest, but to avoid the appearance of labouring under such an influence.\" 14. Summing up the principle laid down by the abovementioned case, Hammond 7 observed as follows: \"The 'no-pecuniary interest' principl e as expressed in Dimes 6 requires a judge to be automatically disqualified when there is neither actual bias nor even an apprehension of bias on the part of that judge. The fundamental philosophical underpinning of Dimes 6 is therefore predicated on a conflict of interest approach.\" 15. The next landmark case on the question of \"bias\" is R. v. Gough 8. Gough was convicted for an offence of conspiracy to rob and was sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen years by the trial court. It was a trial by Jury. After the conviction was announced, it was brought to the notice of the trial court that o ne of the jurors was a neighbour of the convict. The convict appealed to the Court of App e al unsuccessfully. One of th e grounds on which the conviction was challenged was that, in view of the fact that one of the jurors being a neighbour of the convict presented a possibility of bias on her part and therefore the conviction is unsustainable. The Court of Appeal noticed that there are two lines of authority propounding two different tests for determining disqualification of a Judge on the ground of bias: 6 Dim es v.

The matter was carried further to the House of Lords. Lord Goff noticed 8 that there are a series of authorities which are \"not only large in number but bewildering in their effect\". After analysing the judgment in Dimes 6 , Lord Goff held: (Gough cases, AC p. 661 F-G) \"In such a case, therefore, not only is it irrelevant that there was in fact no bias on the part of the tribunal, but there is no question of investigating, from an objective point of view, whether there was any real likelihood of bias, or any reasonable suspicion of bias, on the facts of the particular case. The nature of the interest is such that public confidence in the administration of justice requires that the decision should not stand.\" In other words, where a Judge has a pecuniary interest, no further inquiry as to whether there was a \"real danger\" or \"reasonable suspicion\" of bias is required to be undertaken. But in other cases, such an inquiry is required and the relevant test is the \"real danger\" test: (Gough cases, AC pp. 661 G-H-662 A-B) \" ... But [in other cases], the inquiry is directed to the question whether there was such a degree of possibility of bias on the part of the tribunal that the court will not allow the decision to stand. Such a question may arise in a wide variety of circumstances. These include ... cases in which the member of the tribunal has an interest in the outcome of the proceedings, which falls short of a direct pecuniary interest. Such interests may vary widely in their nature, in their effect, and in their relevance to the subject- matter of the proceedings; and there is no rule ... that the possession of such an interest automatically disqualifies the member of the tribunal from sitting. Each case falls to be considered on its own facts.\" 17. The learned Judge examined various important cases on the subject and finally concluded: (Gough case 8 , AC p. 670 E-G) \" ... Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, I prefer to state the test in terms of real danger rather than real likelihood, to ensure that the court is thinking in terms of possibility rather than probability of bias. Accordingly, having ascertained the relevant circumstances, the court should ask itself whether, having regard to those circumstances, there was a real danger of bias on the part of the relevant member of the tribunal in question, in the sense that he might unfairly regard (or have unfairly regarded) with favour, or disfavour, the case of a party to the issue under consideration by him .... \" 8 R. v.

There is only one established special category and that exists where the tribunal has a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the subject-matter of the proceedings as in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal 6 . The courts should hesitate long before creating any other special category since this will immediately create uncertainty as to what are the parameters of that category and what is the test to be applied in the case of that category. The real danger test is quite capable of producing the right answer and ensure that the purity of justice is maintained across the range of situations where bias may exist.\" 19. In substance, the Court held that in cases where the Judge has a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the proceedings, his disqualification is automatic. No further enquiry whether such an interest lead to a \"real danger\" or gave rise to a \"reasonable suspicion\" is necessary. In cases of other interest, the test to determine whether the Judge is disqualified to hear the case is the \"real danger\" test. 20. The Pinochet case 9 added one more category to the cases of automatic disqualification for a Judge. Pinochet, a former Chilean dictator, was sought to be arrested and extradited from England for his conduct during his incumbency in office. The issue was whether Pinochet was entitled to immunity from such arrest or extradition. Amnesty International, a charitable organisation, participated in the said proceedings with the leave of the Court. The House of Lords held that Pinochet did not enjoy any such immunity. Subsequently, it came to light that Lord Hoffman, one of the members of the Board which heard Pinochet case 10 , was a Director and Chairman of a company (known as AICL) which was closely linked with Amnesty International. An application was made to the House of Lords to set aside the earlier judgment 10 on the ground of bias on the part of Lord Hoffman. 21. The House of Lords examined the following questions: (i) Whether the connection of Lord Hoffman with Amnesty International required him to be automatically disqualified? (ii) Whether an enquiry into the question whether cause of Lord Hoffman's connection with Amnesty International posed a real danger or caused a reasonable apprehension that his judgment is biased - is necessary? 8 R. v.

(iii) Did it make any difference that Lord Hoffman was only a member of a company associated with Amnesty International which was in fact interested in securing the extradition of Senator Pinochet? 22. Lord Wilkinson summarised the principles on which a Judge is disqualified to hear a case. As per Lord Wilkinson: (Pinochet case 9 , AC pp. 132 G-H-133 A-C) \"The fundamental principle is that a man may not be a Judge in his own cause. This principle, as developed by the courts, has two very similar but not identical implications. First it may be applied literally: if a Judge is in fact a party to the litigation or has a financial or proprietary interest in its outcome then he is indeed sitting as a Judge in his own cause. In that case, the mere fact that he is a party to the action or has a financial or proprietary interest in its outcome is sufficient to cause his automatic disqualification. The second application of the principle is where a Judge is not a party to the suit and does not have a financial interest in its outcome, but in some other way his conduct or behaviour may give rise to a suspicion that he is not impartial, for example because of his friendship with a party. This second type of case is not strictly speaking an application of the principle that a man must not be Judge in his own cause, since the Judge will not normally be himself ben e fiting, but providing a benefit for another by failing to b e impartial. In my judgment, this case falls within the first category of case, viz. where the Judge is disqualified because he is a Judge in his own cause. In such a case, once it is shown that the Judge is himself a party to the cause, or has a r elevant inter e st in its subject-matter, h e is disqualified without any investigation into whether there was a likelihood or suspicion of bias. The mere fact of his interest is su fficient to disqualify him unle ss he has made sufficient disclosure .... \" And framed the question: (AC p. 134B-C) f \" ... the question then arises whether, in non-financial litigation, g h anything other than a financial or proprietary interest in the outcome is sufficient automatically to disqualify a man from sitting as Judge in the cause.\" ( emphasis supplied) He opined that although the earlier cases have \"all dealt with automatic disqualification on the grounds of pecuniary interest, there is no good reason in principle for so limiting automatic disqualification\". (AC p. 135B) 23. Lord Wilkinson concluded that Amnesty International and its associate company known as AICL, had a non-pecuniary interest established that Senator 9 R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan S tipendiary Magistrate, exp Pino chet Ugarte (N o. 2), (200 0) 1 AC 119 : (1999) 2 WLR 272 : (1999) 1 All ER 577 (HL) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd. ~cccc® ION LINE;:' True Prinf 826 SUPREME COURT CASES (2016) s sec Pinochet was not immune from the process of extradition. He concluded that: (Pinochet case 9 , AC p. 135C-D) \" ... the matter at issue does not relate to money or economic advantage but is concerned with the promotion of the cause, the rationale disqualifying a Judge applies just as much if the Judge's decision will lead to the promotion of a cause in which the Judge is involved together with one of the parties.\" (emphasis supplied) 24. After so concluding, dealing with the last question, whether the fact that Lord Hoffman was only a member of AICL but not a member of Amnesty International made any difference to the principle, Lord Wilkinson opined that: (Pinochet case 9 , AC p. 132H-133A) even though a Judge may not have financial interest in the outcome of a case, but in some other way his conduct or behaviour may give rise to a suspicion that he is not impartial. ... and held that: (AC p. 135 E-F) \" ... If the absolute impartiality of the judiciary is to be maintained, there must be a rule which automatically disqualifies a Judge who is involved, whether personally or as a Director of a company, in promoting the same causes in the same organisation as is a party to the suit. There is no room for fine distinctions .... \" This aspect of the matter was considered in P.D. Dinakaran case 11. 25. From the above decisions, in our opinion, the following principles emerge: 25.1. If a Judge has a financial interest in the outcome of a case, he is a b C d automatically disqualified from hearing the case. e 25.2. In cases where the interest of the Judge in the case is other than financial, then the disqualification is not automatic but an enquiry is required whether the existence of such an interest disqualifies the Judge tested in the light of either on the principle of \"real danger\" or \"reasonable apprehension\" of bias. 25.3. The Pinochet case 9 added a new category i.e. that the Judge is f automatically disqualified from hearing a case where the Judge is interested in a cause which is being promoted by one of the parties to the case. 26. It is nobody's case that, in the case at hand, Justice Khehar had any pecuniary interest or any other interest falling under the second of the abovementioned categories. By the very nature of the case, no such interest can g arise at all. 27. The question is whether the principle of law laid down in Pinochet case 9 is attracted. In other words, whether Justice Khehar can be said to be sharing any interest which one of the parties is promoting. All the parties to 9 R. v.

The only difference of opinion between the parties is regarding the process by which such a result is to be achieved. Therefore, it cannot be said that Justice Khehar shares any interest which any one of the parties to the proceeding is seeking to promote. 28. The implication of Shri Nariman's submission is that Justice Khehar would be predetermined to hold the impugned legislation to be invalid. We fail to understand the stand of the petitioners. If such apprehension of the petitioners comes true, the beneficiaries would be the petitioners only. The grievance, if any, on this ground should be on the part of the respondents. 29. The learned Attorney General appearing for the Union oflndia made an emphatic statement that the Union of India has no objection for Justice Khehar hearing the matter as a Presiding Judge of the Bench. 30. No precedent has been brought to our notice, where courts ruled at the instance of the beneficiary of bias on the part of the adjudicator, that ajudgment or an administrative decision is either voidable or void on the ground of bias. On the other hand, it is a well-established principle of law that an objection based on bias of the adjudicator can be waived. Courts generally did not entertain such objection raised belatedly by the aggrieved party: \"The right to object to a disqualified adjudicator may be waived, and this may be so even where the disqualification is statutory. 12 The court normally insists that the objection shall be taken as soon as the party prejudiced knows the facts which entitle him to object. If, after he or his advisors know of the disqualification, they let the proceedings continue without protest, they are held to have waived their objection and the determination cannot be challenged.\" 13 In our opinion, the implication of the above principle is that only a party who has suffered or is likely to suffer an adverse adjudication because of the possibility of bias on the part of the adjudicator can raise the objection. 31. The significant power as described by Shri Nariman does not inhere only to the members of the Collegium, but inheres in every Judge of this Court who might be called upon to express his opinion regarding the proposals of various appointments of the High Court Judges, Chief Justices or Judges of this Court, while the members of the Collegium are required to exercise such \"significant power\" with respect to each and every appointment of the abovementioned categories, the other Judges of this Court are required to exercise such \"significant power\", at least with respect to the appointments to or from the High Court with which they were earlier associated with either as Judges or Chief Justices. The argument of Shri N ariman, if accepted would render all the Judges of this Court disqualified from hearing the present controversy.

JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J. t (concurring) - In this Court one gets used to writing common orders, for orders are written either on behalf of the Bench, or on behalf of the Court. Mostly, dissents are written in the first person. Even though this is not an order in the nature of a dissent, yet it needs to be written in the first person. While endorsing the opinion expressed by J. Chelameswar, J., adjudicating upon the prayer for my recusal, from hearing the matters in hand, reasons for my continuation on the Bench, also need to be expressed by me. Not for advocating any principle of law, but for laying down certain principles of conduct. 34. This order is in the nature of a prelude-a precursor, to the determination of the main controversy. It has been necessitated, for deciding an objection about the present composition of the Bench. As already noted above, J. Chelameswar, J. has rendered the decision on the objection. The events which followed the order of J. Chelameswar, J., are also of some significance. In my considered view, they too need to be narrated, for only then, the entire matter can be considered to hav e be e n fully expressed, as it ought to be. I also need to record reasons, why my continuation on the reconstituted Bench, was the only course open to me. And therefore, my side of its understanding, dealing with the perception of the other side of the Bench. 35. A three-Judge Bench was originally constituted for hearing these matters.

It was pointed out, that the above prayer had resulted in his having exercised the option to step aside (on 15-4-2015 3 ). Some learned counsel went to the extent of asserting that the recusal of Anil R. Dave, J. was not only unfair, but was also motivated. It was also suggested that the Bench should be reconstituted, by requesting Anil R. Dave, J. to preside over the Bench. The above sequence of facts reveals that the recusal by Anil R. Dave, J. was not at his own, but in deference to a similar prayer made to him. Logically, if he had heard these cases when he was the presiding Judge of the three-Judge Bench, he would have heard it, when the Bench strength was increased, wherein, he was still the presiding Judge. 46. Mr Fali S. N ariman strongly refuted the impression sought to be created, that he had ever required Anil R. Dave, J. to recuse. In order to support his assertion, he pointed out that he had made the following request in writing on 15-4-2015: \"The provisions of the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 and of the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 have been brought into force from 13-4-2015. As a consequence, the Presiding Judge on this Bench, the Hon'ble Mr Justice Anil R. Dave, has now become (not out of choice but by force of statute) a Member ex officio of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, whose constitutional validity has been challenged. It is respectfully submitted that it would be appropriate if it is declared at the outset-by an order of this Hon 'ble Court-that the Presiding Judge on this Bench will take no part whatever in the proceedings of the National Judicial Appointments Commission.\" (emphasis supplied) The learned Senior Counsel pointed out that he had merely requested the then presiding Judge (Anil R. Dave, J.) not to take any part in the proceedings of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, during the hearing of these matters. He asserted, that he had never asked Anil R. Dave, J. not to hear the matters pending before the Bench. 47. The submission made in writing by Mr Mathews J. Nedumpara for the recusal of Anil R.

The question then arises is as to who could decide it. The doctrine of necessity leaves no other option than the Supreme Court itself deciding the question. But in that case, it could be by Judges who are not part of the Collegium as of today or, if an NJAC is to be constituted today, could be a member thereof. With utmost respect, Hon'ble Shri Justice Dave is a Member of the Collegium; His Lordship will be a Member of NJAC if it is constituted today. Therefore, there is a manifest conflict of interest. VII. Referendum- In Australia, a Constitutional Amendment was brought in, limiting the retirement age of Judges to 70 years. Instead of the Judges deciding the correctness of the said decision, the validity of the amendment was left to be decided by a referendum, and 80% of the population supported the amendment. Therefore, the only body who could decide whether NJAC as envisaged is acceptable or not is the people of this country upon a referendum. VIII. The judgment in Judges 2 1, which made the rewriting of the Constitution, is void ab initio. The said case was decided without notice to the public at large. Only the views of the Government and Advocates- On-Record and a few others were heard. In the instant case, the public at large ought to be afforded an opportunity to be heard; at least the major political parties, and the case should be referred to the Constitutional Bench. The constitutionality of the Acts ought to be decided, brushing aside the feeble, nay, apologetical plea of the learned Attorney General that the Acts have been brought into force and their validity cannot be challenged, and failing to come forward and state in candid terms that the Acts are the will of the people, spoken through their elected representatives and that too without any division , unanimous. The plea of the Advocates-On-Record Association that the notification bringing into force the said Acts be stayed, be rejected forthwith; so too its demand that the Collegium system, which has ceased to be in existence, be allowed to be continued and appointments to the august office of Judges of High Courts and Supreme Court on its recommendation, for to do so would mean that Judges of the High Courts who are currently Chief Justices because they were appointed at a young age in preference over others will be appointed as Judges of the Supreme Court and if that is allowed to happen , it may lead to a situation where the Supreme Court tomorrow will literally be packed with sons and sons-in- law of former Judges. There are at least three Chief Justices of High Courts who are sons of former Judges of the Supreme Court. The petitioner is no privy to any confidential information, not even gossips. Still he believes that if the implementation of NJAC is stayed, three sons of former Judges of the Supreme Court could be appointed as Judges of the Supreme Court. l Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v.

The petitioner readily concedes, and it is a pleasure to do so, that few of them are highly competent and richly deserving to be appointed. IX. Equality before law and equal protection of law in the matter of public employment. The office of the Judge of the High Court and Supreme Court, though high constitutional office, is still in the realm of public employment, to which every person eligible ought to be given an opportunity to occupy, he being selected on a transparent, just, fair and non- arbitrary system. The petitioner reiterates that he could be least deserving to be appointed when considered along with others more meritorious than him, but the fact that since he satisfies all the basic eligibility criteria prescribed under Articles 124-A, as amended, and 217, he is entitled to seek a declaration at the hands of this Hon'ble Court that an open selection be made by advertisement of vacancies or such other appropriate mechanism. X. Judicial review versus democracy- Judicial review is only to prevent unjust laws to be enacted and the rights of the minorities, whatever colour they could be in terms of religion, race , views they hold, by a legislation which enjoys brutal majority and an act of the executive which is tyrannical. It is no way intended to substitute the voice of the people by the voice of the high judiciary. XI. Article 124-A, as amended, is deficient only in one respect. The Collegium contemplated thereunder is still fully loaded in favour of the high judiciary. Three out of the six members are Judges. In that sense it is failing to meet to be just and democratic. But Parliament has in its wisdom enacted so and if there is a complaint , the forum is to generate public opinion and seek greater democracy. The petitioner is currently not interested in that; he is happy with the Act s as enacted and the principal relief which he seeks in the instant petition is the immediate coming into force of the said Acts by appropriate notification and a mandamus to that effect at the hands of this Hon'ble Court.\" 48. When my recusal from the reconstituted Bench was sought on 21-4-2015, I had expressed unequivocally, that I had no desire to hear the matters. Yet, ke eping in view the reasons expressed in writing by Mr Fali S. Nariman, with reference to Anil R. Dave, J. I had disclosed in open court, that I had already sent a communication to the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India, that I would not participate in the proceedings of the 1 + 4 Collegium (of which I was a member), till the disposal of these matters. Yet, the obj e ction was pressed. It needs to be recorded that Anil R. Dave, J. was a member of the 1 + 2 Collegium, as well as , the 1 + 4 Collegium from the day the hearing in these matters commenced. Surprisingly, on that account, his recusal was never sought, and he had continued to hear the matters, when he was so placed (from 11-3-2015 to 7-4-2015). But for my being a member of the 1 + 4 Collegium, a prayer had been made for my recusal. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It was, and still is, my personal view, which I do not wish to thrust either on Mr Fali S. Nariman, or on Mr Mathews J. Nedumpara, that Anil R. Dave , J. was amongst the most suited to preside over the reconstituted Bench. As noticed above, he was a part of the 1 + 2 Collegium, as also, the 1 + 4 Collegium, under the \"Collegium system\"; he would continue to discharge the same responsibilities, as an ex officio Member of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, in the \"Commission system\", under the constitutional amendment enforced with effect from 13-4-2015. Therefore, irrespective of the system which would survive the adjudicatory process, Anil R. Dave, J. would participate in the selection, appointment and transfer of Judges of the higher judiciary. He would, therefore, not be affected by the determination of the present controversy, one way or the other. SO. The prayer for my recusal from the Bench was pressed by Mr Fali S. Nariman, Senior Advocate, in writing, as under: \"8. In the present case the Presiding Judge (the Hon'ble Mr Justice J.S. Khehar), by reason of judgments reported in the Second Judges case Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v.

The position of the Presiding Judge on this Bench hearing these cases of constitutional challenge is not consistent with (and apparently conflicts with) his position as a member of the 'Collegium'; and is likely to be seen as such; always bearing in mind that if the Constitution Amendment and the statute pertaining thereto are held constitutionally valid and are upheld, the present Presiding Judge would no longer be part of the Collegium - the Collegium it must be acknowledged exercises significant constitutional power. 9. In other words would it be inappropriate for the Hon'ble Presiding Judge to continue to sit on a Bench that adjudicates whether the Coll egium system [as it is in place for the past two decades and is stated (in the writ petitions) to be a part of the ba sic structure of the Constitution], should continue or not continue. The impression in people's mind would be that it is inappropriate if not unfair if a sitting member of a Collegium sits in judgment over a scheme that seeks to replace it.

Khehar, the presiding Judge, a Judge whom the petitioner holds in high esteem and respect, a Judge known for his uprightness, impartiality and erudition , the petitioner is afraid to say, ought not to preside over the Constitution Bench deciding the constitutional validity or otherwise of the Constitution (Ninety-ninth Amendment) Act, 2014 and the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 (\"the said Acts\", for short). His Lordship will be a member of the Collegium if this Hon'ble Court were to hold that the said Acts are unconstitutional or to stay the operation of the said Acts, for, if the operation of the Acts is stayed, it is likely to be construed that the Collegium system continues to be in force by virtue of such stay order. Though Hon'ble Shri Justice J.S. Khehar is not a Member of the National Judicial Appointments Commission, for, if NJAC is to be constituted today, it will be consisting of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India and two seniormost Judges of this Hon'ble Court. With the reti r ement of Hon'ble Shri H.L. Dattu, Chief Ju stice of India, His Lordship Hon'ble Shri Justice J.S. Khehar will become a Member of the Collegium. Therefore, an ordinary man, nay, an informed onlooker, an expression found acceptance at the hands of this Hon'ble Court on the question of judicial recusal, will consider that justice would not have been done if a Bench of this Hon'ble Court headed by Hon'ble Shri Justice J.S. Khehar were to h e ar the above case. For a not so informed onlooker, the layman, the aam aadmi, this Hon'ble Court hearing the writ petitions challenging the aforesaid Acts is nothing but a fox being on the jury at a goose's trial. The petitioner believes that the noble heart of His Lordship Justice Khehar could unwittingly be influenced by the non-conscious, subconscious, unconscious bias , His Lordship having placed himself in a position of conflict of interest. 3. This Hon'ble Court itself hearing the case involving the power of appointment of Judges between the Collegium and the Government, nay, the executive, will not evince any public confidence, except the designated senior lawyer s who seem to be supporting the Collegium system. The Collegium system does not have any confidence in the ordinary lawyers who are often unfairly treated nor the ordinary litigants, the Daridra Narayanas, to borrow an expression from legendary Justice Krishna Iyer, who considered t that the higher judiciary, and the Supr eme Court in particular , is beyond the reach of the ordinary man. An ordinary lawyer finds it difficult to get even an entry into the Supreme Court premises. This is the stark reality, though many prefer to pretend not to notice it.

Khehar from hearing the above case.\" 52. As a Judge presiding over the reconstituted Bench, I found myself in an awkward predicament. I had no personal desire to participate in the hearing of these matters. I was a part of the Bench because of my nomination to it by Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India. My recusal from the Bench at the asking of Mr Fali S. Nariman, whom I hold in great esteem, did not need a second thought. It is not as if the prayer made by Mr Mathews J. Nedumpara, was inconsequential. 53. But then, this was the second occasion when proceedings in a matter would have be en deferred, just because, Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India, in the first instance, had nominated Anil R. Dave, J. on the Bench, and thereafter, had sub stituted him by nominating me to the Bench. It was therefore felt that reasons ought to be recorded after hearing the learned counsel, at least for the guidance of Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India, so that His Lordship may not make another nomination to the Bench which may be similarly objected to. This, coupled with the submissions advanced by Mr Mukul Rohatgi, Mr Harish N. Salve and Mr K.K. Venugopal, that parameters should be laid down, led to a hearing on the issue of recusal. 54. On the basis of the submissions advanced by the learned counsel, the Bench examined the prayer, whether I should remain on the reconstituted Bench, despite my being a member of the 1 + 4 Collegium. The Bench, unanimously concluded that there was no conflict of interest, and no other justifiable reason in law, for me to recuse from the hearing of these matters . On 22-4-2015 3, the Bench passed the following short order, which was pronounced by J. Chelameswar , J.: (SCAoRA case3, SCC p. 410) \"A preliminary objection, whether Ju stice Jagdi sh Singh Khehar should preside over this Bench, by virtue of his being the fourth seniormost Judge of this Court, also happens to be a member of the Collegium, was raised by the petitioners. Elaborate submissions were made by the learned counsel for the petitioners and the respondents. After hearing all the learned counsel, we are of the unanimous opinion that we do not see any reason in law requiring Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar to recuse himself from hearing the matter. Reasons will follow.\" 55. After the order was pronounced, I disclosed to my colleagues on the Bench that I was still undecided whether I should remain on the Bench, for I was toying with the idea of recusal, because a prayer to that effect had been made in the face of the Court. My colleagues on the Bench would have nothing of it. They were unequivocal in their protestation. 3 Supreme Court Advo cat es-on-Re cord Assn. v.

Despite the factual position noticed above, I wish to record that it is not their persuasion or exhortation, which made me take a final call on the matter. The decision to remain a member of the reconstituted Bench was mine, and mine alone. The choice that I made, was not of the heart, but that of the head. The choice was made by posing two questions to myself. Firstly, whether a Judge hearing a matter should recuse, even though the prayer for recusal is found to be unjustified and unwarranted? Secondly, whether I would stand true to the oath of my office, if I recused from h e aring the matters? 57. The reason that was pointed out against me, for seeking my recusal was, that I was a part of the 1 + 4 Collegium. But that should have been a disqualification for Anil R. Dave, J. as well. When he commenced hearing of the matters, and till 7-4-2015, he suffered the same alleged disqualification. Yet, the objection raised against me, was not raised against him. When confronted, Mr Fali S. Nariman vociferously contested , that he had not sought the recusal of Anil R. Dave, J. He supported his assertion with proof. One wonders, why did he not seek the recusal of Anil R. Dave, J.? There is no doubt about the fact, that I have been a member of the 1 + 4 Collegium, and it is likely that I would also shortly become a Member of N JAC, if the present challenge raised by the petitioners was not to succeed. I would therefore remain a part of the selection procedure, irrespective of the process which prevails. That however is the position with reference to four of us (on the instant five-Judge Bench). Besides me, my colleagues on the Bench- J. Chelameswar, Madan B. Lokur and Kurian Joseph, JJ. would in due course be a part of the Collegium (if the writ p e titioners before this Court wer e to succeed), or alternatively, would be a part of NJAC (if the writ petitioners were to fail). In such eventuality, the averment of conflict o f interest, ought to have been raised not only against me, but also against my three colleagues. But, that was not the manner in which the issue has been canvassed. In my considered view, the prayer for my recusal is not well founded. If I were to accede to the prayer for my recusal, I would be initiating a wrong practice, and laying down a wrong precedent. A Judge may recuse at his own, from a case entrusted to him by the Chief Justice. That would be a matter of his own choosing. But recusal at the asking of a litigating party, unless justified, must never to be acceded to. For that would give the impression, of the Judge had been scared out of the case, just by the force of the objection. A Judge before he assumes his office, takes an oath to discharge his duties without fear or favour. He would breach his oath of office, if he accepts a prayer for recusal, unless justified. It is my duty to discharge my responsibility with absolute earnestness and sincerity. It is my duty to abide by my oath of office to uphold the Constitution and the laws. My decision to continue to be a part of the Bench, flows from the oath which I took, at the time ofmy elevation to this Court. MADAN B. LOKUR, J. (concurring with Khehar, J. and Chelameswar and A.K. Goel, JJ.; and partly disagreeing with Kurian, J.)- I have had the benefit of going through the draft order prepared by my learned brothers Justice Khehar, Justice Chelameswar and Justice Kurian Joseph.

Chelameswar, I would like to add a few words on the procedural aspect of dealing with an application for recusal. 59. Justice Khehar has mentioned in para 56 of the draft order as follows: \" ... The decision to remain as a member of the reconstituted Bench was mine, and mine alone.\" 60. In my respectful opinion, when an application is made for the recusal of a Judge from hearing a case, the application is made to the Judge concerned and not to the Bench as a whole. Therefore, my learned brother Justice Khehar is absolutely correct in stating that the decision is entirely his, and I respect his decision. 61. In a detailed order pronounced in Court on its Own Motion v. State 18 reference was made to a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Jewell Ridge Coal Corpn. v. Local No. 6167, United Mine Workers of America 19, wherein it was held that a complaint as to the qualification of a Justice of the Supreme Court to take part in the decision of a cause cannot properly be addressed to the Court as a whole and it is the responsibility of each Justice to determine for himself the propriety of withdrawing from a case. 62. This view was adverted to by Rehnquist, J. in Hanrahan v. Hampton 20 in the following words: \"Plaintiffs-respondents and their counsel in these cases have moved that I be recused from the proceedings in this case for the reasons stated in their 14-page motion and their five appendices filed with the Clerk of this Court on 3-4-1980. The motion is opposed by the State defendant petitioners in the action. Since generally the Court as an institution leaves such motions, even though they be addressed to it, to the decision of the individual Justices to whom they refer, see Jewell Ridge Coal Corpn. v. Local No. 6167, United Mine Workers of America 19 (denial of petition for rehearing) (Jackson, J., concurring), I shall treat the motion as addressed to me individually. I have considered the motion, the appendices, the response of the State defendants, 28 U.S.C. 455 (1976 ed. And Supp. II), and the current American Bar Association Code of Judicial Conduct, and the motion is accordingly denied.\" 63. The issue ofrecusal may be looked at slightly differently apart from the legal nuance. What would happen if, in a Bench of five Judges, an application is moved for the recusal of Judge A and after hearing the application Judge A decides to recuse from the case but the other four Judges disagree and express the opinion that there is no justifiable reason for Judge A to recuse from the hearing? Can Judge A be compelled to hear the case even though he/she is desirous of recusing from the hearing? It is to get over such a difficult situation 18 Cri M No. 11677 of2007 in WP (Cri) No. 796 of 2007, order dated 29-11-2007 (Del) 19 89 L Ed 2007: 325 US 897: 1945 SCC OnLine US SC 133 (1945) 20 64 L Ed 2d 214: 446 US 1301 : 1980 SCC OnLine US SC 81 (1980) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

As far as the view expressed by Justice Kurian Joseph that reasons should be given while deciding an application for recusal, I would prefer not to join that decision. In the first place, giving or not giving reasons was not an issue before us. That reasons are presently being given is a different matter altogether. Secondly, the giving ofreasons is fraught with some di fficulties. For example, it is possible that in a given case, a learned Judge of the High Court accepts an application for his/her recusal from a case and one of the parties challenges that order in this Court. Upon hearing the parties, this Court comes to the conclusion that the reasons given by the learned Judge were frivolous and therefore the order is incorrect and is then set aside. In such an event, can this Court pass a consequential order requiring the learn ed Judge to hear the case even though he/she genuinely believes that he/she should not hear the case? 65. The issue of recusal from hearing a case is not as simple as it appears. The questions thrown up are quite significant and since it appears that such applications are gaining frequency, it is time that some procedural and substanti ve rules are framed in this regard. If appropriate rules are framed, then, in a given case, it would avoid embarra ssment to other Judges on the Bench. KURIAN JOSEPH, J. (concurring entirely with Chelameswar and Goel, JJ.; par tly disagreeing with Lokur, J.)- I wholly agree with the view taken by my esteemed brother, Chelameswar, J. that there is no situation warranting recusal of Justice Khehar in this case. Now, that we have to pass a detailed and reasoned order as to why a Judge need not recuse from a case, I feel it appropriate also to deal with the other side of the coin, whether a Judge should state reasons for his r ecusal in a particular case. 67. One of the reasons for recusal of a Judge is that litigants/the public might entertain a reasonable apprehension about his impartiality. As Lord Chief Justice Hewart said: (KB p. 259) \"... it is not merely of some importance but is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.\" 21 And therefore, in order to uphold the credibility of the integrity institution, the Judge recuses from hearing the case. 68. A Judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, while assuming office, takes an oath as prescribed under Schedule III to the Constitution of India, that: a b C d e f \" ... I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as g by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my ability, knowledge and judgment perform the duties of my office without fear or favour, affection or ill will and that I will uphold th e Constitution and th e laws.\" h 21 R. v.

Called upon to discharge the duties of the office without fear or favour, affection or ill will, it is only desirable, if not proper , that a Judge, for any unavoidable reason like some pecuniary interest, affinity or adversity with the parties in the case, direct or indirect interest in the outcome of the litigation, family directly involved in litigation on the same issue elsewhere , the Judge being aware that he or someone in his immediate family has an interest, financial or otherwise that could have a substantial bearing as a consequence of the decision in the litigation, etc., to recuse himself from the adjudication of a particular matter. No doubt, these examples are not exhaustive. 70. Guidelines on the ethical conduct of the Judges were formulated in the Chief Justices' Conference held in 1999 known as \"Restatement of Judicial Values of Judicial Life\". Those principles, as a matter of fact, formed the basis of \"the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, 2002\" formulated at the Round Table Meeting of Chief Justices held at the Peace Palace, The Hague. It is seen from the Preamble that the Drafting Committee had taken into consideration thirty-two such statements all over the world including that of India. On Value 2 \" Impartiality\", it is resolved as follows: \"Principle: Impartiality is essential to the proper discharge of the judicial office. It applies not only to the decision itself but also to the process by which the decision is made. Appli cation: 2.1. A Judge shall perform his or her judicial duties without favour, bias or prejudice. 2.2. A Judge shall ensure that his or her conduct , both in and out of court, maintains and enhances the confidence of the public, the legal profession and litigants in the impartiality of the Judge and of the judiciary. 2.3. A Judge shall, so far as is reasonable , so conduct himself or herself as to minimise the occasions on which it will be necessary for the Judge to be disqualified from hearing or deciding cases. 2.4. A Judge shall not knowingly, while a proceeding is before, or could come befor e , the Judge, make any comment that might re asonably b e expected to affect the outcome of such proceeding or impair the manifest fairness of the process. Nor shall the Judg e make any comment in public or otherwise that might affect the fair trial of any person or issue. 2.5. A Judge shall disqualify himself or herself from participating in any proceedings in which the Judge is unable to decide the matter impartially or in which it may appear to a reasonable observer that the Judge is unable to decide the matter impartially. Such proceedings include, but are not limited to, instances where 2.5.1 the Judge has actual bias or prejudice concerning a party or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding s ; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The simple question is, whether the adjudication by the Judge concerned, would cause a reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonably informed litigant and fair-minded public as to his impartiality. Being an institution whose hallmark is transparency, it is only proper that the Judge discharging high and noble duties, at least broadly indicate the reasons for recusing from the case so that the litigants or the well-meaning public may not entertain any misunderstanding that the recusal was for altogether irrelevant reasons like the cases being very old, involving detailed consideration, decision on several questions of law, a situation where the Judge is not happy with the roster, a Judge getting unduly sensitive about the public perception of his image, a Judge wanting not to cause displeasure to anybody, a Judge always wanting not to decide any sensitive or controversial issues, etc. Once reasons for recusal are indicated , there will not be any room for attributing any motive for the recusal. To put it differently, it is part of his duty to be accountable to the Constitution by upholding it without fear or favour, affection or ill will. Therefore, I am of the view that it is the constitutional duty, as reflected in one's oath, to be transparent and accountable, and hence, a Judge is required to indicate reasons for his recusal from a particular case. This would help to curb th e tend ency for forum shopping. 72. In Public Utilities Commission of District of Columbia v. Pollak 22 , the Supreme Court of United States dealt with a question whether in the District of Columbia, the Constitution of the United States precludes a street railway company from receiving and amplifying radio programmes through loudspeakers in its pas senger vehicles. Frankfurter, J. was always averse to the practice and he was of the view that it is not proper. His personal philosophy and his stand on the course apparently, were known to the people. Even otherwise, he was convinced of his strong position on this issue. Therefore, stating so, he recused from participating in the case. To quote his words: (SCC OnLine US SC paras 33-34) \"33. The judicial process demands that a Judge move within the framework of relevant legal rules and the covenanted modes of thought for ascertaining them. He must think dispassionately and submerge private feeling on every aspect of a case. There is a good deal of shallow talk that the judicial robe does not change the man within it. It does. The fact is that on the whole Judges do lay aside private views in discharging their judicial functions. This is achieved through training, professional 22 1952 SCC OnLine US SC 69 : 96 L Ed 1068: 343 US 45 1 (1952 ) b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

But it is also true that reason cannot control the subconscious influence of feelings of which it is unaware. When there is ground for believing that such unconscious feelings may operate in the ultimate judgment, or may not unfairly lead others to believe they are operating, Judges recuse themselves. They do not sit in judgment. They do this for a variety of reasons. The guiding consideration is that the administration of justice should reasonably appear to be disinterested as well as be so in fact. 34. This case for me presents such a situation. My feelings are so strongly engaged as a victim of the practice in controversy that I had better not participate in judicial judgment upon it. I am explicit as to the reason for my non-participation in this case because I have for some time been of the view that it is desirable to state why one takes himself out of a case.\" 73. According to Mathew, J. in S. Parthasarathi v. State of A.P. 23 , in case right-minded persons entertain a feeling that there is any likelihood of bias on the part of the Judge, he must recuse. Mere possibility of such a feeling is not enough. There must exist circumstances where a reasonable and fair-minded man would think it probable or likely that the Judge would be prejudiced against a litigant. To quote: (SCC pp. 465-66, para 16) \"16. The tests of 'real likelihood' and 'reasonable suspicion' are really inconsistent with each other. We think that the reviewing authority must make a determination on the basis of the whole evidence before it, whether a reasonable man would in the circumstances infer that there is real likelihood of bias. The Court must look at the impression which other people have. This follows from the principle that justice must not only be done but seen to be done. If right-minded persons would think that there is real likelihood of bias on the part of an inquiring officer, he must not conduct the enquiry; nevertheless, there must be a real likelihood of bias. Surmise or conjecture would not be enough. There must exist circumstances from which reasonable men would think it probable or likely that the inquiring officer will be prejudiced against the delinquent. The Court will not inquire whether he was really prejudiced. If a reasonable man would think on the basis of the existing circumstances that he is likely to be prejudiced, that is sufficient to quash the decision [see per Lord Denning, H.R. in Metrop o litan Propertie s Co. (FCC) Ltd. v. Lannon 24 , WLR at p. 707]. We should not, however, be under stood to deny that the Court might with greater propriety apply the 'reasonable suspicion' test in criminal or in proceedings analogous to criminal proceedings.\" 74. There may be situations where mischievous litigants wanting to avoid a Judge may be because he is known to them to be very strong and thus making 23 (1974) 3 sec 45 9 : 1973 sec (L&S) 580 24 (1969 ) 1 QB 577 : (1968 ) 3 WLR 694 (CA) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd. ~cccc® ION LINE;:' True Prinf 844 SUPREME COURT CASES (2016) s sec an attempt for forum shopping by raising baseless submissions on conflict of interest. The Constitutional Court of South Africa in President of the Republic of South Africa v. South African Rugby Football Union 25 , has made two very relevant observations in this regard: (ZACC para 46) \"46 . ... 'Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a Judge, they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour.' ... 'It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of disqualification is a reasonable apprehension that the judicial officer will not decide the case impartially or without prejudice, rather than that he will decide the case adversely to one party.'*\" 75. Ultimately, the question is whether a fair-minded and reasonably informed person, on correct facts, would reasonably entertain a doubt on the impartiality of the Judge. The reasonableness of the apprehension must be assessed in the light of the oath of office he has taken as a Judge to administer justice without fear or favour, affection or ill will and his ability to carry out the oath by reason of his training and experience whereby he is in a position to disabuse his mind of any irrelevant personal belief or predisposition or unwarranted apprehensions of his image in public or difficulty in deciding a controversial issue particularly when the same is highly sensitive. 76. These issues have been succinctly discussed by the Constitutional Court in President of the Republic of South Africa 25 , on an application for recusal of four of the Judges in the Constitutional Court. After elaborately considering the factual matrix as well as the legal position, the Court held as follows: (ZACC para 104) \"104 . ... While litigants have the right to apply for the recusal of judicial officers where there is a reasonable apprehension that they will not decide a case impartially, this does not give them the right to object to their cases being heard by particular judicial officers simply because they believe that such persons will be less likely to decide the case in their favour, than would other judicial officers drawn from a different segment of society. The nature of the judicial function involves the performance of difficult and at times unpleasant tasks. Judicial officers are nonetheless required to 'administer justice to all persons alike without fear, favour or prejudice, in accordance with the Constitution and the law'. To this end they must resist all manner of pressure, regardless of where it comes from. This is the constitutional duty common to all judicial officers. If they deviate, the independence of the judiciary would be undermined, and in turn, the Constitution itself.\" (emphasis supplied) 25 (1999) 4 SA 147: 1999 ZACC 9 * Ed.: See also JRL, exp CJL, In re, (1986) 161 CLR 342,352: (1986) 66 ALR 239. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Impartiality of a Judge is the sine qua non for the integrity institution. Transparency in procedure is one of the major factors constituting the integrity of the office of a Judge in conducting his duties and the functioning of the court. The litigants would always like to know though they may not have a prescribed right to know, as to why a Judge has recused from hearing the case or despite request, has not recused to hear his case. Reasons are required to be indicated broadly. Of course, in case the disclosure of the reasons is likely to affect prejudicially any case or cause or interest of someone else, the Judge is free to state that on account of personal reasons which the Judge does not want to disclose , he has decided to recuse himself from hearing the case.
