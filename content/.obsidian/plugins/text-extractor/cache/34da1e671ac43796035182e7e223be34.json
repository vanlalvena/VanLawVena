Gauba, a barrister, filed a complaint to the District Magistrate accusing the Official Jleceiver of serious crimes including those alleged by S. M. Saleh, and au investigation having been ordered by the District Magistrate, cer- tain records were seized by the police. Under the orders of the High Court these records were subsequently released, the proceed- ings were quashed, and the investigation prohibited. The High Court held that the matters complained of by Mr. Gauba concern- ed the actions of the Respoudent in his official capacity as Receiver, and that being a public servant not removable from his office with- out the sanction of the local Government, and having been accused of an o:ffence as such public servant, Section 197, Criminal Proce- dure Code preclu,ded any Court from taking cognizance of the offence without the previous sanction of the Local Government. The com- plaint was therefore dismissed and the District Magistrate's order for an investigation quashed. Their Lordships in the judgment of the Privy Council point out that, while ac<'epting the view that no findings in a civil pro- ceeding- are binding- in a subsequent prosecution founJ.ed on the f-arne or similar alleµ:ations, the stage for the production of the Lo<'al Governrneut.'s .,andion to the prosecution had not been reaC'lH-'<l and then• lws hen1 a :,;erious interference with the statutory rights of the polif'P to iuYestiµ:ate tlie \"irPumstances of an alleged (·oguizable <·rime ,\\·ithout requiring- any authority from the judicial authorities.

Their Lordships' juidgment was delivered by LoRD PoRTER: This appeal is brought from a judgment and order of the High Court of .T u<licature at Lahore dated the 24th October 1941 (Crimi- nal Revision Side). The question raised is stated, and their Lord- ships think correctly stated, in the case presented by the respondent to be whether the High Court had power, under,.ection 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to quash all proceedings tals:en in pur- suance of two first information reports.

However this mav be and however the offence may be describ- -ed in the report itself. their Lordships are satisfied tl~at there can rightly be spelt out of it an offence again:-:t ~edion 4m) wliicl1 ii- ,d:-;o a cognisable offence and possibly also one against section 420. Apart from this, the later report though again it condescends upon rather meagre particulars, plainly indicates an accusation of :an offence against section 409 and the offence is so described. In their Lordships' view therefore, both information reports <lharge the accused man with cognisahle offences under which the police are entitled to enquire without a magistrate's order. Their Lordships think it right to set out these matters be<'ause j~; was strenuously argued before them on behalf of the respondent that the only accusation of which account could be taken was that <;ontained in the first of the two reports, that the offence there charg·- ed was a nQI1-cognisable offence an<l therefore the poli<'e were pre- dli.ded. under section 155 of the Cr. P. C. from enquiring into it without a magistrate's order. · The argument as their Lor(fohips understoocl it was that the only information report under section 154 to 156 of Or. P. C. wa~ 1 hat recor<led on the 31st August 1941, that the alleg·ations record- ed at a later stage of the 5th· Sevtember were not. an informai ion report; but a statement taken in the course of an investigation under sections 161 and 162 of the Code, that there was therefore no reported cognisable offence into which the police were entitle(l to {'nquire, but only a 11on-cognisable offence whic-h required a magis-trate's order if an investigation was to be authorise<l. Their Lordships cannot accede to this argument. 'l'hey would point out that the respondent in his case treats each document as a separate information report and iu<leed, on the argument presented ~m his behalf, rightly so, since_ eacJi disc'loses a separate offence, the second not being a mere amplification of the first, but the disclosure of Ju.rther criminal.activities. But in any case the re<'eipt and re- cording of an information report is not a condition precedent to the setting in fn.otion of a criminal investigation. No doubt in the great majority of cases, criminal prosecution are undertaken as a result of information received and recorded in this way, but their Lordships see no rea8on why the police, if in possession through th~ir own k~wledge or by means of credible though informal in-telligence which genuinely tead8 them to the belief. that a cogni-sable offence has been committed, should not of their own motion undertake an investigation into the truth of the matters alleo-ed. Section 157 of the Cr.-P. C., when directing that a police officer. ~ho bas reason to suspect from infor1nation or otherwise that an offence which he is empowered to investigate under section 156 has been committed shall proceed to investigate the £acts and circumst1nces, 1mpports this view.

As has already been pointed out, the respondent himself speaks- of two information reports in the case presented for their Lord!\\hips~ consideration. Though the High Court in their judgment discuss-- ed the queiition \\Yhetber the 01rly crime formally di,,closed was not cognisable and if so whether the investigation based upon the infor- mation report of the 30th August should not be quashed, they gave- no deeision on the matter, saying tml;v that it raised a difficult point of law whi<'h they found it unneee:-isary to decide. 1,hey then pro- ceeded to determine the point at issue upon other grounds which are those raised in the cases i>resented to their Lordships. These it is now neeessar;v to disc11.ss. It appears that S. M. Saleh was the son of Sheikh Jl,ahmatullah who_ died in 1924 and that some time after his death disputes arose l)etween his children including S. M. Saleh as to the partition of his property. In thjs dispute arbitrators were originally appointed but their authority to act was afterwards withdrawn. One 0£ the assets was a busin~ss which had been carried on by the father and after his death was continued hy · the wife and ehildren as a single part1wr:-;hip eoncern aceording to the respective shares in the prop- <'rt;,· left h}· the deceased ma 1,. and in 1937 a suit was begun · by Sa le h against his brot11ers and sister for partition of the family property and for di:-;solution of the partnersl1ip and rendition of aC'counts. The respondent is the Special Official Receiver of the llig-h Court. Lahore, ancl was in that capa<'it~- appointerl on the 17th. August 1937, as receiver in this suit. The criminal charge which the police were investigating con- cerns his activities in the receivership and his alleged behaviour in seeking the appointment. According to Saleh he was persuaded by the respondent by means of various fraudule:tft representations to- undertake the suit and to ask that the respondent shoul(\\ be appoint- ed receiver of the property. If this story is true there is no dou,bt bnt that Saleh was a party to an appointment made for the purpose of ove:i;reaching his brothers and sister. At a later stage, however, Saleh became dissatisfied with the activities of the respondent ae: reeen-C:'r and on the 27th June 1939, a pp lied to have ~im removed frqm the receivership and supported. his a_pplication by an affidavit sworn on the 9th of ,June. The grounds of the application were substanti::i,lly the same as those put · forward in the two informntion reports as crimina'l acts calling for a prosecution. The Subordinat~ Judge refused to accede to the application, but ~he receiver voluntarily resigned and Saleh and one of. his brofE'~rs S. A. Mannan were appointed in his place. In order to clarify the position however, the Subordinate Judge, a short time Htterwards, ·viz.; on the 30th August · 1939, directed the respondent to Ct!.!Atinue in possession of certain _property, the subject matter of ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: ILR (Lahore), © 2023 EBC Publishing Pvt.

From -these two orders Saleh appealed to the High Court which on the -4th .April, 1940, dismissed the appeal with costs, observing: · \"It appears that the chnrges are baseless and that no loss attributable to the conduct of Khwaja Nazir Ahmad can be shown. The charges .it is 1·1ear from the record have been made recklessly and without any attempt to ·examine the history of the case, a proper considera• tion of which would have prevented any reasonable person fron1 using such terms aR fraud and dishonesty. It is most irn.proper ·t.hat such charges shoulrl be made without any justification.'' . The next step appears to haye heen taken by one K. L. Gauba, a barrister who had represented Saleh in certain of the proceedings. 'This gentleman ou the 7th August ] 941, made a written complaint to a District Magistrate charging the respondent with a number of ,crimes and amongst others referred to the ('harge made 11y Saleh and enclosed his clirmt's aflir1avit of the 9th .Tune, 1939, in support of his application ·for the <lismissal of the respondent from his re<'eivership . • The District Magistrate malle an order for investigation info the -cliarg·e:-; and• under this order the respondent's recor~s were seized hy the polire on the 27th August. · Thereupon the respondent peti• tioned the High Court on the 28th August, 1941, for their release 3no for sta:v of the investigation on the ground that he was a public servant within the definition of the Indian Penal Code. and there- fore under section 197 of the Or.

'l'wo matters were then 1·011sidered, firstly the Court's right ~ take cognizance of lfr. Gauha's petition whid1 was opposed by both the respondent and the Crown and in respect of which there were cross petitions asking that the proceedings be quashed, and second-ly what, if any, onler should lie issued by way of interfering with the investigation begun by the poli('e on Sa'leh's infoPIDation reports. • • As to the first. il1e B igh Court helcl that the mattern complain--ed of hy M.r. Gauha <.·oncemec1 the adion of the respondent in his official capacity as receiver and therefore that he being a public serva:nt not. removable from his office without the sanction of the· local Government, aud having· heen accused of an offence as such public servant, section 197 of the Or. P. C. precluded any Court from taking cognizance of tlit• offence without the previous sanction of the Government having- power to or<ler his removal. They ac-cordingly dismissed the complaint arnl (]Uashed the order of the District Magistrate. • In that case Mr. Chuba had petitioned the Court. 'l1he prohi-bition contaiued in section 197 is against action by any Court and' in tliE->se ciTcumstauC'e;-; the decision of the High Cou;rt was accepted and its or<ler is uo1 the subject of any appeal. The action of the-police in investigating SalE->h's eliarges is a different matter.

The Higl1 Court decicled that it was entitled to q1'ash the p:ro-ceedin1.rs nnd pr0hibit the investigation.

In the result they found none. ' AH this may be good ground for a rejection of Saleh's accusa- tion and a dismissal of any prosecution launched upon his informa- tion if such a prosecution u•ltimately take-, place and if the Courts are then satisfied that no crime has been established. But that stage has not been reached. It is · conceded that the :findings in a civil proceeding are not binding in a subsequent prosecution founo., ed upon th!;l same or similar allegations. Moreover the police in- vestigation was stopped and it cannot be said with certainty that no more information could be obtained. But even if it were not it is the duty of a criminal court when a prosecution for a crime takes place before it to form its own view and not to reach its con- clusion by reference to any previous decision which is not binding upon it: · Iii their Lordships' opinion however, t,he more serious aspect of the cas~ is to be found in the resultant interferenf'e bY the Court with the duties of the police. Just as it is essential that even· one accused of a crime shou·ld have free access to a court of justice so that he may be duly acquitted if found not g·uilty of the offence with which he is charged, so it is of the utmost importance that the judiciary should not interfere with the police in matters which are within their province and into which the law imposes upon them the duty of enquiry. In India as has been shown there is a statutor~- rig·ht on the part of the police to investigate the circumstances of an alleg-en cognizable crime without requiring any authorit;-- from the ju<licial authorities, an<l it woul<l, as their Lordships think. he an unfortu- nate result if it should be held possible to interfen· with those statutory rights by an exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the Court. The functions of the judiciary and the police are comple- mentary not overlapping and the. combination of individual iiberty with a due observance of law and order is only to be obtained by leaving each to e~rcise its own function, always of course subject to the right of the Court to intervene in an appropriate case when movert unrter section 491 of the Cr. P. C. to g-ive directions in the nature of habeas corpus. In such a case as the present, however, the Court's functions begin when a charge is preferred before it and not until then. It has sometimes been thought that Bection 561.A: haR given •ncreased powers to the Court which it did not possess before that section was enacted. But this is not BO. The section irives no new powers, it onlv provides that those which the Court alread:v inherently posRess shall be preserved and is inserted as their Lordships think , lest it shou]d be considered that the only powers posseRsed by the Court are those expressly conferred by the Cr. P. C. and that no inherent power had survived the passing of that Act. . No doubt if no cognizable offence is disclosed, and still fa.ore if no offence of any kind is disclosed the police would have no a~thority to undertake an inw,stigat.ion and for this reason Newsam J. may 19« To Kma EKPUOB.
