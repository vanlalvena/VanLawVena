This appeal arises out of the Judgment dated 08.04.2021, passed by the High Court of Delhi in Regular First Appeal No.218 of 2021 (hereinafter referred as ‘RFA No.218 of 2021’) preferred by the Appellant, whereby the said RFA was dismissed and the High Court thereby upheld the Order dated 01.12.2020 passed in Civil Suit No.867ADJ-O7, Saket Court, (South East), New Delhi. 3. The brief facts of the matter are that Appellant was a tenant in the Residential Property owned by Respondent bearing No. B-228, KARAN KAPOOR v. MADHURI KUMAR A B D E F G H 680 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2022] 16 S.C.R. Ground Floor, Greater Kailash-1, New Delhi-110048, including the built- up area in the stilt portion of the building (hereinafter referred as the, four bedrooms with attached bathrooms, kitchen, lounge, service areaAgreement dated 07.08.2011 with proprietorship concern of the Appellant, namely M/s. Fantasy Lights, at monthly rent of Rs.1,17,000/- for a period of 24 months1 till 07.08.2013 and interest free security deposit of Rs.3,51,000/- (Three Lakhs Fifty – One Thousand Only) was paid byAppellant at the time of the execution of the Lease Agreement. After the expiry of the Lease Agreement, an extended Lease Agreement for subsequent term of 11 months was executed on 07.08.2013 at the rate of Rent of Rs.1,50,000/- per month which was to expire onAgreement dated 07.08.2013 as well. 4. The Appellant tenant did not pay any rent after the expiry of the extended Lease Agreement dated 06.07.2014 with effect from 07.07.2014 and continued in occupation of the Suit Property. A Legal Notice dated 12.04.2018 was served by the Respondent landlord uponAppellant calling him to vacate the Suit Property. However, even thereafter, neither the Suit Property was vacated, nor the rent was paid which led the Respondent/Plaintiff to file Civil Suit No.867 of 2018 forADJ-O7, Saket Court, (South East), New Delhi. The Appellant/Defendant filed a Written Statement contending that after the expiry of the Lease Agreement dated 07.08.2013, the Respondent/ Plaintiff had approached to him and made the offer to sell the right, title, in furtherance of which Agreement to Sell dated 22.04.2017 (herein after referred as ‘ATS-I’) was executed between the parties for a sum of Rs.3,60,00,000/- (Three Crores andAgreement to Sell. Appellant also contended that in addition to the execution of ATS-I, he also agreed to transfer its right, title and interest of a plot of land situated at Amloh in favor of Respondent for a consideration of Rs.15 Lakhs throughTS-II’) which would partially satisfy the obligations of sale consideration of ATS-I. Further, it was averred in the Written A B D E F G H 681 Statement that certain adjustments were made to the considerationAgreement to Sell (‘ATS-III’) was executed. 5. In view of the averments made in Written Statement filed by the Appellant/Defendant in Civil Suit No.867 of 2018, the Respondent/ Plaintiff filed an Application under Order XII Rule 6 and another application under Order XXXIX Rule 10 of the Code of Civil ProcedureWritten Statement and to draw a decree accordingly. 6. The contention of the Respondent/Plaintiff before the Trial Court was that looking to the admissions made with respect to theenant relationship, rate of rent and the defense taken by the Appellant/Defendant in Written Statement is sham, as no consideration was exchanged. While on the other side, the Appellant/Defendant contended that the Respondent/Plaintiff has concealed the material factsATS-I, II and III, though the two Lease Agreement dated 07.08.2011 and dated 07.08.2013 were not denied. It was said only on the expiry of the term of the extended Lease Agreement, the Respondent/Plaintiff approached the Appellant/Defendant and offered to sell the Suit Property. Further it was contended that, no demand to the accrued rent was made as it was agreed between the parties that theATS. In furtherance of which ATS-I dated 22.04.2017 was executed by the Respondent/Plaintiff in favor ofAppellant agreed to pay Rs.3,60,00,000/- as consideration. It was also contendedAppellant/Defendant before the Trial Court that earlier Rs.4.7 Cr. was agreed towards consideration, however, after the payment of enormous earnest money to the Respondent before signing ATS-I, the consideration was reduced to Rs.3.6 Cr. Subsequently, Second Agreement to Sell dated 22.05.2017 was signed to transfer Appellant’s rights, title and interest in the property situated in Amloh to representatives of Respondent for a sum of Rs.15,00,000/- (Fifteen Lakhs Only) which. payable to the Respondent. Further, Third Agreement to Sell dated 30.12.2017 was executed between the parties consequent to the aforesaid adjustments.Appellant/Defendant also argued before the Trial Court to have approached the Allahabad Bank for loan amounting to Rs.1.7 Cr. to purchase the Suit Property, but the Respondent/Plaintiff refused to KARAN KAPOOR v. MADHURI KUMAR [J. K. MAHESHWARI, J.] A B D E F G H 682 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2022] 16 S.C.R. execute the subject Sale Deed. Lastly, it was submitted that there is no clear and categorical admission from his side and the Written Statement filed by him and the suit has to be read as a whole and not in isolation., the present Suit involves adjudication of facts and serious questions of law which is possible only after leading oral evidence and 7. The Trial Court perused the material on record and in Para 17 of the order dated 01.12.2020 recorded that there are certain undisputedAgreement dated 07.08.2011 between the Plaintiff and M/s Fantasy Lights @ Rs.1,17,000/- per month for theAgreement dated 07.08.2013 between the Plaintiff and Defendant for 11 months @ Rs.1,50,000/- per month is also not disputed; (f) It is not disputed that no rent has been paid since July 2014 8. Apart from dealing with the aforementioned admissions, the Trial Court also dealt with each defense taken by the Appellant in the written statement and observed: (i) Appellant/Respondent did not mention any amount which has been paid by him as ‘Bayana’ in lieu of the ATS- I dated 22.04.2017. It is beyond the comprehension of the Court as toAppellant from mentioning the exact figures of the amount paid by the Appellant as ‘Bayana’; (ii) No document was placed before the Court by Appellant/Defendant to show the quantum of amount paid as consideration thus ATS-I executed without any consideration has no significance; (iii) ATS-II with respect to the Amloh Property has also been filed and the same cannot be relied upon for the aforesaidAgreements to Sell have been filed; (v) It is a settled proposition of law that even if the consideration hasuted in his favor and the Tenant-Landlord relationship cannot come to an end on the execution of the Agreement to Sell. A B D E F G H 683 9. The Trial Court relying upon the admissions as aforementioned, passed the judgment and decree allowing the application under Orderf. Aggrieved Appellant/ Defendant sought review of the Order dated 01.12.2020 wherein therial Court was pleased to dismiss the same vide order dated 17.02.2021. 10. The Appellant preferred Regular First Appeal No.218 of 2021 before the High Court of Delhi challenging both the orders i.e. orderTrial Court and review order dated 17.02.2021. It was the case of the Appellant before the High Court that a Suit for specific performance in relation to aforementioned threeTrial Court has considered the same in the impugned judgment. Further, Appellant also contended that no categoric admission was made in the Written Statement to pass judgment granting decree of possession to the Respondent in exercise of discretion under Order XII, it was argued that the Sale Deed is not required to be registered in view of Section 17(2) of the Registration Act. 11. The High Court vide impugned order dated 08.04.2021 rejected the Appeal with observations that the Trial Court in its order dated 17.02.2021 has noted that there has been clear admission with regard toenant and the rent paid by the Appellant. Further, the Appellate Court upheld the Trial Court’s findings qua admission of the facts. The High Court also noted that the findings quaAppellant which is sufficient to grant the decree for possession of suit property. Further, High Court observed that it is settled in law that the suit for specific performance filed by theTrial Court to proceed with or decide the Suit for possession based on Landlord-Tenant relationship. Lastly, an ATS of immovable property where the possession of premises is delivered in part performance can only be possible by registered. The High Court dismissed the Regular First Appeal with the said observations, which is challenged by the Appellant by filing instant appeal. 12. Appellant has argued before this Court that he is well within his rights to defend his possession in the suit property having satisfiedShrimant Rao Suryavanshi v. Prahlad Bhairoba Suryavanshi - 2002 (3) SCC 676. As there is KARAN KAPOOR v. MADHURI KUMAR [J. K. MAHESHWARI, J.] A B D E F G H 684 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2022] 16 S.C.R. an ATS for transfer of rights in the suit property in favor of the Appellant, which has not been disputed to have been signed by Respondent. The. It is further argued by the Appellant that the issues put before the Trial Court were triable issues and in such a scenario the Trial Court should not dismiss the suit in limine and pass a decree under Order XII Rule 6 of CPC when only the truth can be revealed by a full-fledged trial. Appellant also argues that when Seller-Landlord accepted the earnest money she actually actedThis acceptance provided by the ATS ended the relationship of lessor and lessee and the tenancy ceases. 13. Appellant has placed reliance on Hari Steel and General Industries Limited and Another v. Daljit Singh and Others – (2019) 20 SCC 425 and Himani Alloys Ltd. v. Tata Steel Ltd reported in - 2011 (15) SCC 273 to contend that the Trial Court should have refrained from exercising its jurisdiction by decreeing the suit of Respondent/Appellant on merit. Further, by referring to the case of R. Kanthimathi v. Beatrice Xavier reported in - 2000 (9) SCC 339 the Appellant argued that by accepting the earnest money, the Landlord- Seller has actually acted under the agreement and thus the relationship 14. Per Contra, on behalf of Respondent, it has been argued that the Appellant came in the possession of suit premises by virtue of lease deed dated 07.08.2011 and extended lease deed dated 07.08.2013 and is continuing to be in possession without payment of rent from 2014 onwards,. It was urged that Appellant has not put in possession in furtherance to the ATS, however without proving the contents of ATS his status would not change. It was further argued that once it is admitted that there is undisputedenant relationship between parties; a termination notice under Section 106 has been issued prior to filing the suit followed by receipt ofprima facie case to decree the suit on admission under Order XII Rule 6. Further, it has been argued that the defense under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 can only be applicable when consideration has been exchangedAppellant. Furthermore, learned senior counsel placing reliance on Nagindas Ramdas v. Dalptram Iccharam A B D E F G H 685 - 1974 (1) SCC 242 argued that the admissions in pleadings or in proceedings of Court at the time of hearing of the case stand on higher 15. Heard learned counsel for both the parties and perused the records. Prior to appreciating the arguments in the facts and looking to “1. Notice of admission of case.—Any party to a suit mayty. 2. Notice to admit documents.—Either party may call uponty [to admit, within 7 [seven] days from the date of service of the notice any document,] saving all exceptions;efusal or neglect to admit, after such notice, the costs of proving any such document shall be paid by the party so neglecting or refusing, whatever the result of the suit may be, unless the Court otherwise directs; and no costs of proving any document shall be allowed unless such notice is given, except where the omission to give the notice is, in the opinion of the Court, a saving of expense.ty or in his reply to the notice to admit documents, shall be deemed to be admitted except as againstovided that the Court may, in its discretion and for reasons to be recorded, require any document so admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission.

(2) Whenever a judgment is pronounced under sub-rule (1) a decree shall be drawn up in accordance with the judgment A B D E F G H 687 and the decree shall bear the date on which the judgment was pronounced” Thus, the scheme of Order XII Rule 1 prescribes that any party to a suit may give notice, by his pleading, or otherwise in writing that he. As per Rule 2 of Order XII notice to admit the documents may be given byAppendix ‘C’ of CPC. Rule 3A confers overriding powers to the Court, that even in absence of a notice to admit a document under.

Rule 6 confers discretionary power to a Court who ‘may’ at any stage of the suit or 16. Thus, legislative intent is clear by using the word ‘may’ and ‘as it may think fit’ to the nature of admission. The said power is KARAN KAPOOR v. MADHURI KUMAR [J. K. MAHESHWARI, J.] A B D E F G H 688 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2022] 16 S.C.R. provision has been brought with intent that if admission of facts raisedtted by other, and the Court is satisfied to the nature of admission, then the parties are not compelled for full-fledged trial andAs per above discussion, it is clear that to pass a judgment on admission, the Court if 17. Some special provisions have been made in Rules 7, 8 and 9 regarding affidavit of signature, notice to produce documents and also to 18. On the issue of discretion of Court to pass judgment on admission, a three-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of S.M. Asif v. Virendar Kumar Bajaj – (2015) 9 SCC 287 made the legislative intent clear to use the word ‘may’ which clearly stipulates that the powerAppellant-Tenant. The relationship of tenancy was admitted including the period of Lease Agreement. The Plaintiffs’ claim was resisted by the Defendant setting up a plea that theAgreement to Sell. The suit for specific performance was also filed which of course was contested by the, this Court by setting aside the judgment passed by the High Court remitted the matter backTrial Court subject to deposit of the arrears of the rent and the compensation for use of occupation of the suit premises. Such deposit A B D E F G H 689 19. In the context of the said legal position, reverting to the facts of the present case, it is apparent that the first Lease Agreement was executed on 07.08.2011 on a monthly rent of Rs.1,17,000/- of a suit premises. The said Lease Agreement was for a period of 02 years ending in July 2013. By the consent of the parties extended Lease Agreement dated 07.08.2013 was executed for a further period of 11 months for a monthly rent of Rs.1,50,000/- with approximate increase in rent amount. Admittedly, the notice for eviction was issued terminating the lease due to non-payment of the rent after theenant relationship), arrears of rent, mesne profit and pendente lite. The said suit was contested by the Defendant in which the ownership was not denied. The execution of first Lease1 and the extended Lease Agreement dated 07.08.2013 was also not denied. The monthly tenancy and payment ofAgreement is also not denied by the Defendant. The Defendant has taken a defense that the property belonging to him in was agreed to be sold to the Plaintiff to which effect ATS-II dated 25.05.2017 was executed. Further the Defendant has contendedATS-III dated 30.12.2017 was executed after some adjustments in consideration was made. Hence, the Defendant argued that on accountAgreements to Sell with respect to the suit property for a sum of Rs. 3,60,00,000/-, the relationship of Landlord-enant ceased to exist and the Defendant acquired the status of the owner as he has already parted with the possession of the propertyAgreement. 20. Learned counsel for the Appellant has placed heavy reliance on a judgment of R. Kanthimathi (supra). In the said case, this Court has specified that any jural relationship between two persons could be. However, it is urged that the relationship of the Appellant has now been changed to purchaser on signing the ATS-I by landlord subsequent to lease agreement, therefore the relationship of landlord and tenant extinguishes. RelianceHimani Alloys Limited (supra) and it has been urged by Appellant that in case the admission is not of the amount as alleged and not categoric and clear, the decree under Order XII Rule 6 cannot be directed. The case of Hari Steel (supra) KARAN KAPOOR v. MADHURI KUMAR [J. K. MAHESHWARI, J.] A B D E F G H 690 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2022] 16 S.C.R. has also been relied upon to contend that the relief under Order XII Rule, the discretion should be used only when there is a clear, categorical and unconditional admission and such right should not be exercised to deny valuable right of a, relying upon the judgment of Shrimant Shanrao Suryavanshi (supra), it has been contended that when a possession is with the Appellant by virtue of a part performance of agreement to sell as prescribed under SectionTransfer of Property Act, 1882, he has right to defend or protect his possession. 21. On the other hand, Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned senior counsel, placed reliance on the judgment of Nagindas Ramdas (supra), inter alia, contending that the admissions if true and clear are the best proof of the fact admitted, it is also stated the admissions in the pleadingsAct, 1872, made by the parties or their agents at or before hearing of theR. Kanthimathi (supra) is distinguishable with the present case. In the said case, after referring the terms of the agreementAlso, by conveyance the possession of property was surrendered, therefore, Court said that the. While in the present case ATS-I was executed on 22.04.2017. In clause 2 of the said agreement, it was specifically mentioned “however, no advance – earnest money has been paid to the first party”. With respect to possession, it was mentioned that it shall be handed over on spot. Thus,Appellant was in possession under the Lease Agreement as tenant. The document Annexure P-1 (Advance Receipt-cum Agreement to Sale & Purchase) produced alongwith the paperbook of appeal is aR. Kanthimathi (supra) is of no help to the Appellant. A B D E F G H 691 22. Be that as it may, the arguments advanced by both the sides, in our view can be appreciated by the Trial Court by affording opportunity to them to lead evidence. As per the pleadings, there may be admission to the extent of execution of the Lease Agreement, rate of rent and monthly payment but simultaneously the defense taken by the DefendantATS-I, II and III. In view of the contents of those agreements and terms specified therein, the defense as taken by the, for the purpose of Order XII Rule 6, the said admission is not clear and categorical, so as to exercise a discretionWe are only inclined to say whether the judgment and decree passed in exercise of the power under Order XII Rule 6 of CPC is, the facts of the case in hand and the judgment in S.M. Asif (supra) are altogether similar, therefore, the ratio of the said judgment rightly applies to the present, the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court, as confirmed by the High Court, only on admission of fact withoutThe matter is remitted back to the Trial Court to decide the suit as expeditiously as possible affording due opportunity 23. In the present case, the tenant has not paid any amount of rent w.e.f. 07.07.2014. In a suit based on Landlord-Tenant relationship, the amount of rent and arrears thereof ought to be paid in terms of theS.M. Asif (supra). As the Lease Agreement dated 07.08.2011 and the extended Lease Agreement dated 07.08.2013, which are not in dispute and by the extended Lease Agreement, which was for one year, the rent was increased for the year 2013-2014 by 30%. The Defendant has not KARAN KAPOOR v. MADHURI KUMAR [J. K. MAHESHWARI, J.] A B D E F G H 692 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2022] 16 S.C.R. passed. Therefore, we direct that in terms of the admitted fact by extendedAgreement and the increase in the percentage of rent, the Trial Court shall first decide the issue of payment of monthly rent applying theAppellant. 24. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed to the extent indicated hereinabove and the order of High Court and Trial Court is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the Trial Court.
