E Appellant invited tenders for construction work. Respondent no.l submitted the tender and the appellant accepted the same. Tender form submitted by the respondent contained a clause for reference of dispute to the arbitrator. Appellant submitted the letter of acceptance and the date of commencing the work to be from the date of issuance of the letter. It further F stipulated that the document containing the detailed terms and conditions of the contract was to be signed by the parties otherwise no payment would be made; and that the contract stood concluded with the issue of this communication. Respondent deposited earnest money. However, the parties did not sign the contract. Thereafter, appellant informed the respondent that it had decided not to get the work executed and called upon the respondent to G take refund of the earnest money. Respondent issued notice invoking clause 25A of the tender conditions for appointment of arbitrator since the respondent had made arrangements for commencing the work and on cancellation it suffered losses. Appellant invoked clause 13 of the tender conditions that appellant could decide not to proceed with work and as such clause 25 A had H 596 .. '~ .... , MAHARSHI DAYANAND UJ\\'IVERSITY 1.: ANAND COOP. UC SOCIETY LTD 597 no application. Respondent then filed an application under section 11 of the A Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for appointment of arbitrator. Appellant accepted that the tender of the respondent had been accepted but was not liable to pay any damages in view of clause 13 of the tender. District Judge relying upon Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. & Anr. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd's* case appointed the Engineer as arbitrator in terms of the clause 25A of the tender conditions, leaving it to the parties to raise all objections before B the arbitrator under section 16 of the Act. Appellant filed writ petition. High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that the appellant could raise objections before the arbitrator and interference with the order appointing an arbitrator was not called for. Hence the present appeal. Appellant contended that contract as contemplated by the parties containing the detailed terms and conditions was not signed by the parties and in the circumstances there was no arbitration agreement justifying the appointment of an arbitrator; that a question whether there was an arbitration clause or not, had to be decided by the court even under the dispensation; and c that there being no concluded contract, it was just and necessary to interfere D with the order appointing the arbitrator. Dismissing the appeal, the Court HELD: 1.1. There is no reason to interfere with the appointment of an arbitrator. Liberty is given to the parties to raise all their contentions based E on lack of jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal before the arbitrator. [Para 12) [606-F) 1.2. The instant case is governed by the procedure that was available when Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. & Anr's* case held the field. That orders already made were not to be affected by the ratio of the decision in S.B.P. & Company's** case. Therefore, the only question for decision is whether the fact that the parties have not signed the contract containing the detailed specifications as contemplated by the letter of acceptance would preclude the respondent from seeking an arbitration by falling back on clause F 25A of the tender conditions. It is true that when parties during negotiations G contemplate the execution of a formal agreement incorporating the terms of the bargain, so long as a formal agreement has not been entered into, it may be open to contend that there was no concluded contract between the parties. As against this, what is the position in a case where the tender submitted is accepted, its acceptance conveyed and the time for completing the work is stipulated to start from such acceptance, and the work was to commence on H 598 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2007] 5 S.C.R. A the basis of that acceptance but no payment was to be made until a formal contract was signed, is the first question that arises in this case. In the circumstances, this is a question that must be left to be decided by the arbitrator, this is a question that must be left to be decided by the arbitrator, since in terms of S. 16 of the Act the question can be raised before the arbitrator. (Para IO) (605-F, G, H; 606-A, BJ B 1.3. Considering that the pre S.B.P & Company's case dispensation is dealt with, it is not necessary or proper to go into that question and decide the same in these proceedings. Same is the position regarding the scope of clause 13 of the tender and the clauses relied on by counsel for the appellant C in his attempt to take the present claim out of clause 25A of the tender conditions. Therefore, it would be appropriate to leave this question, as also the other questions to be decided by the arbitrator rather than trying to answer them at this stage in view of the fact that this case is not governed by the principles recognized by S.B.P. & Company's case. (Para 10) (606-B, CJ D 1.4. The arbitrator in the first instance, has to decide whether _the E existence of an arbitration agreement in terms of S. 7 of the Act is established and also to decide whether the claim now made is a claim that comes within the purview of clause 25A of the tender conditions in case it is found to be an agreement within the meaning ofS.7 of the Act. Only on deciding these two aspects can the arbitrator go into the merits of the claim made by the respondent But it is clarified that it does not mean, that he would treat these two aspects as preliminary issues and decide them first; but only that he must decide them without fail while proceeding to finally pronounce his award.

It was dated 12.09.2003. ) .. 4. The tender so submitted by the respondent was accepted by the appellant. It was stated in the letter of acceptance, dated 22.11.2003, singed on behalf of the appellant: c \"As approved by the tender committee in its meeting held on 12.10.2003 and further approved by the competent authorities, the acceptance of your tender for the work cited as subject, is further conveyed to you on behalf of the Registrar, M.D.U., Rohtak at the rates contained in your tender dated 12.9.2003. This is subject to the terms and conditions D of the approved Detailed notice inviting tender (/NIT) of the above works.\" (emphasis supplied) The date of start of the work was indicated to be \"from the date of issue of this letter.\" The time limit was fixed as four months. It contained a further E stipulation: \"You are requested to contact the SOE (C-1) M.D.U. Rohtak for taking the work in hand. The document containing the detailed terms and conditions of the contract are ready and you are requested to attend F this office on any working day for signing the same. No payment will be made to you unless you sign the contract agreement. The contract stands concluded with the issue of this communication. \" (emphasis supplied) The respondent, admittedly deposited an earnest money of G > '-\"' Rs. 10,700/-. 5. It is the case of the appellant that the site was not demarcated. It is common case that a document containing detailed terms and conditions of the contract as envisaged by the acceptance letter was not signed by the parties. H 604 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2007] 5 S.C.R. A In the letter dated 8.3.2004 the appellant informed the respondent that it had J decided not to get the work executed. The letter also called upon the respondent to get the earnest money of Rs. I 0, 700/- refunded. 6. The respondent issued a notice to the appellant invoking clause 25A B of the tender conditions quoted above, calling upon the appellant to appoint an arbitrator in terms of that clause on a claim that on acceptance of his tender, the respondent had made arrangements for commencing the work, had put up sheds, had engaged labourers and had procured materials and on -f cancellation, losses have been incurred and the respondent was entitled to \" recover the same from the appellant. The appellant took the stand that under c clause 13 of the tender conditions, the appellant was entitled to decide not to proceed with the work and no claim, as made on the side of the respondent, was maintainable. Clause 25A had no application. The claims were also factually disputed. 7. In that context, respondent No. 1 invoked the jurisdiction of the D District Court under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Reconciliation Act, 1996 (for short 'the Act') seeking the appointment of an arbitrator. After referring to the invitation for tenders, its submission of tender, and of its acceptance, 'j.. the respondent also disclosed that no agreement was signed between the parties but asserted that the conditions mentioned in the tender form were E made applicable. The respondent requested to the court to call upon the appell<1.nt to produce the original tender form submitted by the respondent. The appellant accepted the fact that the tender of the respondent had been accepted. But the appellant was not liable to pay any damages in view of clause 13 of the tender conditions. No payment was to be made unless the contract agreement was signed. It also contended that the dispute that was F sought to be raised by the respondent was outside clause 25A of the tender conditions relied on by the respondent. 8. The District Judge, controlled as he then was, by the decision in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. & Anr. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd., [2002) 2 SCC 388, appointed the Superintending Engineer as arbitrator by G relying on clause 25A of the tender conditions, leaving it to the parties to raise all objections, including the objection to his jurisdiction, before the >.. ' arbitrator in terms of Section 16 of the Act. Feeling dissatisfied, the appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court relying on the decision of this Court that since the order based on the application under Section 11 was an H administrative order, a writ petition was maintainable, by referring to State of MAHARSHI DAY ANAND UNlVERSITY v. ANAND COOP. UC SOCIETY LID. [BALASUBRAMANYAN, J.) 605 \\. Orissa and Ors v. Gokulananda Jena, (2003] 6 SCC 465 AIR (2003) SC 4207. A The High Court held that the objections sought to be raised could be raised by the appellant before the arbitrator and there was no reason for the High Court to interfere with the order appointing an arbitrator in the circumstances of the case. It is feeling aggrieved thereby that the appellant has come up with this appeal by special leave. B 9. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that no contract as ) contemplated by the parties containing the detailed terms and conditions was ~ signed- by the parties and in the circumstances there was no arbitration agreement as understood in the Act justifying the appointment of an arbitrator. Counsel brought to our notice Section 7 of the Act. Counsel also referred to c the fact that in the subsequent decision in S.B.P. & Company v. Patel Engineering Ltd. & Anr., (2005] 8 SCC 618 this Court has overruled the decision in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. & Anr. (supra) and the ratio thereof is no more available to the respondent. Counsel also referred to the decision in Willington Associates Ltd. v. Kirit Meta, (2000] 4 SCC 272 to submit that a question whether there was an arbitration clause or not, had to D be decided by the court even under the dispensation recognized by the earlier \\ decision in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. & Anr. (supra). Counsel submitted that in view of the fact that a contract in writing had not come into existence by both the parties by affixing their signatures as contemplated by them, there was no concluded contract in the case on hand and it was just E and necessary to interfere with the order appointing the arbitrator. As we have indicated earlier, the respondent has not chosen to appear before us to answer these contentions. I 0. The present case is governed by the procedure that was available . ., when Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. & Anr. (supra) held the field. That F orders already made were not to be affected by the ratio of the decision in S.B.P. & Company (supra) is clear from paragraph 46 of that decision wherein prior orders and proceedings have been saved. Therefore, the only question for decision is whether the fact that the parties have not signed the contract containing the detailed specifications as contemplated by the letter of G acceptance would preclude the respondent from seeking an arbitration by ___..... ~ falling back on clause 25A of the tender conditions quoted above. It is true that when parties during negotiations contemplate the execution of a formal agreement incorporating the terms of the bargain, so long as a formal agreement has not been entered into, it may be open to contend that there was no concluded contract between the parties. As against this, what is the position H 606 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2007) 5 S.C.R. ... A in a case where the tender submitted is accepted, its acceptance conveyed -' and the time for completing the work is stipulated to start from such acceptance, and the work was to commence on the basis of that acceptance but no payment was to be made until a formal contract was signed, is the first question that arises in this case. We think that in the circumstances, this is B a question that must be left to be decided by the arbitrator, since in terms of Section 16 of the Act the question can be raised before the arbitrator. Considering that we are dealing with the pre S.B.P. & Company (supra) dispensation, we do not think that it is necessary or proper for us to go into { that question and decide the same in these proceedings. Same is the position ,. regarding the scope of clause 13 of the tender and the clauses relied on by c counsel for the appellant in his attempt to take the present claim out of clause 25A of the tender conditions. We are, therefore, satisfied that it would be appropriate to leave this question, as also the other questions to be decided by the arbitrator rather than our trying to answer them at this stage in view of the fact that this case is not governed by the principles recognized by D S.B.P. & Company (supra). 11. But we make it clear that the arbitrator, in the first instance, has to decide whether the existence of an arbitration agreement in terms of Section 7 of the Act is established and also to decide whether the claim now made is a claim that comes within the purview of clause 25A of the tender conditions E in case it is found to be an agreement within the meaning of Section 7 of the Act. Only on deciding these two aspects can the arbitrator go into the merits of the claim made by the respondent. But we clarify that it does not mean, that he should treat these two aspects as preliminary issues and decide them first; but only that he must decide them without fail while proceeding to finally pronounce his award. F , 12. In this view of the matter, we see no reason to interfere with the appointment of an arbitrator. We dismiss this appeal giving liberty to the parties to raise all their contentions based on lack of jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal before the arbitrator. The arbitrator will permit the appellant to amend G or supplement the objections already filed by it if it is felt necessary by the appellant. We make no order as to costs. ~ .. NJ.
