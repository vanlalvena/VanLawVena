The petitioner, a partner in a firm had filed a suit seeking the dissolut jon of the partnership and rendition of accounts. The D Comm~rcial Sub Judge gave a finding in favour of the petitioner and appointed a local commissioner to go into the accounts. Th.e petitioner moved an appli::ati.on before the local commissioner that he was the owner of the shop premises used for runnieg the partnership and that the possession of the shop sltould revert back to him after the disst1lution. Reference was also made to E the termg of the partnership deed. In his report the local com- missioner did not make any mention of the shop. The Commer- dal Sub J adge, also, while pa~sing the final decree, did not pass any order!'> regarding the possession of the shop. The petitioner thereafter moved an application ujs 151 C.P .C. praying that tlte final decree should be modified to incorporate the relief of F possession of the shop in favour of the petitioner. This applica- tion was dismissed on the 6round that after passing the fin.al decree th~ court had become functus officio. Feeling aggrieved the peihioner filed the present revision petition.

Facts in brief leading to the filing of the application before the Commercial Sub Judg-e are : that the petitioner had G instituted a civil suit in . the year 1970 seeking dissolution of partnership and rendition of accounts on the averments that the petitioner and his two brothers are owners of 3098 in Hathi Khana, Bahadurgarh .

It was averred that ~hc- ;1~,rtner- ship was at will and the petitioner-plaintiff gave a nojk,~ dis- solving the partnership and required the ddcnd,mt-rcs;pondcnt to render the accounts. B 3. The suit was contested by Sher Singh on the ground that in fact there was no partnership entered ino between him and the petitioner and as a matter of fact the petitioner ind let out the shop inclusive of industrial - power connection at a rental of Rs. 50 p.m. and the petitioner had been paid huge premium for letting out the said premises and the puwa \\.:On- e nection. He had pleaded that the partnership deed was got executed as a sham document as in law the petitionti· was not entitled to let out the power connection and in fact no pcirtuer- 5hip business was ever carried on in the shop in question. After hot contest Shri K. S. Gupta, Commercial Sub Judge, vid:! his judgment dated 20th December, 1974 gave findings that ther;.'!

I\" E am told that a second appeal flle<l by Sher Singh was dbm1s~ed in limine by this court. A local commissioner was duly appointed later on, on the application moved by the petitiotter to go ~ntn the accounts and the local commissioner filed his report.

He produced a carbon copy of the alleged compromise deed. The petitioner hotly contested the claim of the respondent in this connection and after recording evidence Shri R. N. B Jindal vide his judgment dated 21st August, I 984 dismissed the objections of the respondent. On January 11, 1985 Shri Jindal recorded an order mentioning that the plaintiff accepted the report of the local commissioner and, thu~, he passed the :final decree for recovery of Rs. 22,100 with costs in favour 0f the plaintiff and against the defendant. The plaintiff was C given fifteen days' time to file necessary court fee. Requisite court fee appears to have been filed but .it appears that the final decree. is yet to be drawn by the learned judge on the court fee. The petitioner moved an application before the Commercial Sub Judge praying that the final decree should be varied in order to incorporate the relief of possession of the D shop in favour of the petitioner. This application has been dismissed by the learned Sub Judge on the reasoning that the court has pecome functus officio and no re.lief of possession can be gr~nted. It is also mentioned in the order that no such relief of possession had been claimed in the plaint or E before the local commissioner. A show cause notice was issued in this civil revision to the respondent and Shri S. P. Mahajan, counsel for the respondent, appeared at the time ef admission of the revision petition. In an application moved by the petitioner this court passed an order on 26th November. 1985 appointing Shri Bhushan Lal Anand-, Advocate, _ as a F receiver and he was required to take over possession of the shop in question and keep it sealed. One Subhash Ch.and filed an application in this court ·that he has been given possession of the shop and could not be dispossessed. His application wa<.; dismissed vide order dated 4th March, 1986 ..

According to the petitioner he was the owner of the shop and the shop has been used for partnership business on th~ basis of the partnership deed exe- cuted between the parties. The respondent, however, took up the plea that the partnership was a bogus and sham document B and that in fact he had been inducted in the shop as a tenant. A finding has been given by the court that the partner- ship was a genuine one and the partnership business came into existence between th parties and the plea of the respondent that he was inducted in the premises as a tenant was also rejected. One of the terms of the partnership deed unequivo- C calJy shows that the possession of the shop was to revert back to the petitioner on 'the partnership being dissolved. In a suit for dissolution of partnership and settlement of accounts, 0rdinarily the liabilities have to be paid and assets to be collected and the business has to be wound up ( see :- Tarif D Singh v. Kanshi Ram and others-AIR 1936 Lahore 458).(1) In Alluri Appamma and others v. Balaji Lal and others (AIR 1957 AP 974)(2) it was observed that in a suit for dissolution of partnership, the partnership assets have to be valued, the accounts have to be taken, the liabilities have to be ascertained, their discharge has to be provided for and the balance of the- :E partnership assets should be directed to be divideo between the partners according to their shares. Where this is not done and the plaintiff is directed to a separate suit, the dir~ction is wholly erroneous in law. In Mohabbat Ali v. Ajudhia Prasad and another (AIR 1957 AU. 285) (3) there was a partnership and F a suit was brought seeking: di'ssolution of partnership and rendition of accounts. The suit was decreed but the words used in the decree were that it is declared that the partnersl1in stands dissolved and the plaintiff and defendant will be entitled to certain quantity of coal each. In execution an objection was taken that no decree of possession has been passed to the said G quantitv of coal and so the decree was not. executable. The contention was negatived and it was held that although the word 'possession' had not been mentioned in the decree but from the nature of the suit it is clear that the decree was for actual possession of the coal. H 6. ln the -pre\"ent case the court was duty bound to dedde completely and effectively re1?ardin~ the accounts of the oartner- ship.

The court failed to incorporate the relief of possession of the shop in its final decree due to some misapprehension and may be due to the fault of the petitioner in not pointing out to the court at that very moment that :;uch a relief has to be incorporated in the final decree. The B court was perhaps misled in not incorporating such a relief of possession in the final decree in view of the fact that the local commissioner has not made a mention of shop in his report. It has to be again emphasised that in the claim filed before the lccal commissioner the petitioner had prayed to the local com- e missioner for mentioning in the re.port that the possession of the shop in any case has to be given to the petitioner. ''It is a maxim of law that an act of court shall prejudice no man. Every court and tribunal has an inherent jurisdiction apart from statutory jurisdiction to correct any error commitied by itself. It can invoke such jurisdiction and can exercise it in 0 appropriate case where its cpnscience is aroused and if it considers that without the exercise of such powers the ends of justice would be frustrated.\" In the present case, as already mentioned above, it was ·the duty of the court to completely wind up the partnership affairs and while doing so make a E specific order with regard to the shop which was being used by the partnership business. The omission by the Court to make any order in this respect is, on the face of it, a mistake of the court. For this mistake of the court the petitioner · should not have been penalised by dismissing his application when he pointed out the said mistake and required the court to correct F the decree so as to incorporate the relief of possession of the shop in the final decree. Counsel for the petitioner has made reference to a few judgments where the courts have exercised iurisdiction under Section 151 or Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure for correcting the mistakes appearing in the U. order -0f the court. One of such cases :is Nalampati Radha- krishnaiah v. Union Bank of Tndia (1982-1 Andhra Weekly Reporter 426) ( 4). In the said case the court omitted to exer- cise its discretion with regard to the award of future interest in a mortgage suit. On an application being moved under Section l 52 requiring the court to exercise such a discretion the High H Court held that such error appearing in the order of the · court can be corrected under the provisions of Section 152. In Manila! Gadiya v.

In Bajrang Rai and others v. Ismail Mian and others (AIR 1978 Patna 339) C-6) the Full Bench of the said court pointed out various situations where such inherent powers could be exercised under Section 15 l. B One of the situations is where there does not exist any specific provision to meet the necessities of a particular case. The court has inherent powers to pass such order as are com- mensurate with the interest of justice. \"In the {Kesent case 0bviously the court due to some misapprehension had failed C to incorporate the relief of possession in respect of the shop in favour of the petitioner in its final decree and there fo no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure which could be taken resort to by the petitioner· for getting the same mistake rectified except by invoking the inherent powers of the court under D Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\" In Smt Annapurmt Chatterjee v. Smt. Sabita Guba and others (AIR 1979 Cal. 338(7) it was held that if a litigant is made to suffer on account of default of the court, the court will not be justified in refusing him to grant relief on technical grounos. E 7. After al1 the 1-ocal commissioner was appointed only to assist the court in havin~ the accounts of partnership scrutinisc··l and to arrive at proper finding as to what amount would be due from one party to another. It was the duty of the court itself to decide on the main point arising between the parties regard- F i~g the possession of the shop in question as to whether the shop was to remain with the respondent or was to revert back to the petitioner. The moment the court gave the finding iH its judgment that the plea of the respondent was false that he had heen inducted in the shop as a tenant, the intention of tlw <:'.0urt from the preliminary decree itse]f was obvious that after G the accounts had to be · completely finalised, the shop waa fe revert hack to the petiiioner as provided in the partnership deed itself.
