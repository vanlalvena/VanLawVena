The deceased, therefore could not repay the debts incurred for the contracts and was in agony for which he committed suicide. In his suicide note, the deceased indicated the said reason for his suicide.

The High Court held that as the appellant was in judicial custody, he should avail the remedy of bail under Section 439 CrPC. Allowing the appeal, granting interim bail and remanding the matter to the High Court for adjudication matter on merits, the Supreme Court Held: \"A\" Summary reflected in Para 219(3) of the Bombay Police Manual - Meaning and import The meaning and import of an \"A\" Summary is reflected in Para 219(3) of the Bombay Police Manual, 1959. An \"A\" Summary indicates a case where an offence has been committed but it is undetected, in that there is no clue about the culprits or the property, or where the accused is known but there is no evidence to justify their being sent up to the Magistrate for trial. (Paras 10 and 26) Vinubhai Haribhai Malaviya v. State of Gujarat, (2019) 17 SCC 1 : (2020) 3 SCC (Cri) 228 , cited Following the \"A\" Summary, there was an exchange of correspondence between ARG (the media and news company of the appellant) and the informant (wife of deceased). ARG by their letter dated 11-6-2019, addressed to CDPL (architecture, engineering designing and consultancy company of the deceased), the informant and her daughter, indicated that several meetings had been held in the past between them during the course of which ARG had sought indemnities from CDPL against any future claims. In its letter, ARG stated that it would be transferring a sum ofRs 39.01 lakhs into CDPL's last known bank account against an indemnity for future claims by the creditors or lenders of CDPL. In response, on 15-6-2019, the informant addressed a communication to ARG stating that out of a total billed amount of Rs 6.45 crores, an amount of Rs 5.75 crores had been received from ARG, and after adjustment of an amount of Rs 70.39 lakhs towards deductions made from the bill, an amount of Rs 88.02 lakhs was due and payable. On 6-11-2019, ARG addressed another letter to the informant recording the closure of the police investigation and reiterating its readiness to pay an amount ofRs 39.01 lakhs subject to due authorisation. The matter appears to have rested there until a flurry of developments took place in the month of April 2020. (Para 11) Allegedly besides present matter, various malicious proceedings had been initiated against the appellant During the course of the present proceedings, the appellant has adverted to proceedings initiated against him previously by the State of Maharashtra, in order to support his case that the arrest is vitiated by malice in fact. (Para 12) 9 On 16-4-2020, a broadcast took place on Republic TV, followed by a broadcast on Republic Bharat on 21-4-2020 in relation to an incident which took place in Gadchinchle Village of Palghar District in Maharashtra. During the course of this incident on 16-4-2020, three persons, including two sadhus, were brutally killed by a mob, allegedly in the presence of the police and forest guard personnel. According to the appellant, on his news show titled \"Poochta hai Bharat\" on 21-4-2020, he h had raised issues in relation to the allegedly tardy investigation of the incident by the police.

The content of the FIRs was similar , almost identical. In the State of Maharashtra, an FIR was lodged at Police Station Sadar, District Nagpur City. Apart from the above FIR, fourteen other FIRs and complaints were lodged against the appellant in relation to his broadcasts. (Para 14) Arnab Ranjan Goswami v.

The Court granted liberty to the appellant to pursue such remedies as were available in law before the competent forum for quashing FIR No. 164 of 2020. (Para 16) Arnab Ranjan Goswami v.

The High Court, in other words, failed to apply its mind to a fundamental issue which needed to be considered while dealing with a petition for quashing under Article 226 of the Constitution or Section 482 CrPC. The High Court, by its judgment dated 9-11-2020, has instead allowed the petition for quashing to stand over for hearing a month later, and therefore declined to allow the appellant's prayer for interim bail and relegated him to the remedy under Section 439 CrPC.

(Para 48) Ingredients of offence \"whoever abets the commission of such suicide\" under a Section 306 IPC read with Section 107 IPC Three segments of Section 107 IPC Section 306 IPC stipulates that if a person commits suicide \"whoever abets the commission of such suicide\" shall be punished with imprisonment extending up to 10 years. Section 107 is comprised within Chapter V IPC, which is titled \"Of Abetment\". (Para 49) The first segment of Section 107 IPC defines abetment as the instigation of a person to do a particular thing. The second segment defines it with reference to engaging in a conspiracy with one or more other persons for the doing of a thing, and an act or illegal omission in pursuance of the conspiracy. Under the third segment, abetment is founded on intentionally aiding the doing of a thing either by an act or omission. (Para 50) State ofW.B. v. Orilal Jaiswal, (1994) 1 SCC 73 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 107; Randhir Singh v. State of Punjab, (2004) 13 sec 129: 2005 sec (Cri) 56; Kishori Lal v.

State of Gujarat, (2009) 4 SCC 52 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 62 , relied on Instigation In cases of alleged abetment of suicide there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of harassment without there being any positive action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused which led or compelled the person to commit suicide, conviction in terms of Section 306 IPC is not sustainable. (Para 50) Amalendu Pal v. State of W.B., (2010) 1 SCC 707: (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 896, relied on Instigation, \"literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about by persuasion to do anything\". (Para 51) Kishori Lal v. State of M.P., (2007) 10 SCC 797 : (2007) 3 SCC (Cri) 701, relied on Mens rea Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. In order to convict a person under Section 306 IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and that act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed suicide. (Para 51) S.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan , (2010) 12 SCC 190: (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 465; Madan Mohan Singh v.

State of Gujarat, 2008 SCC OnLine Guj 568, held, reversed To prove the offence of abetment, as specified under Section 107 IPC, the state of mind to commit a particular crime must be visible, to determine the culpability. In order to prove mens rea, there has to be something on record to establish or show that the appellant herein had a guilty mind and in furtherance of that state of mind, abetted the suicide of the deceased.

The act of the accused, however, insulting the deceased by using abusive language will not, by itself, constitute the abetment of suicide. There should be evidence capable of suggesting that the accused intended by such act to instigate the deceased to commit suicide. Unless the ingredients of instigation/abetment to commit suicide are satisfied the accused cannot be convicted under Section 306 IPC. (Para 55) M. Arjunan V.

In order to bring a case within the purview of Section 306 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the person who is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. (Para 57) Rajesh v. State of Haryana, (2020) 15 SCC 359, relied on Contents of FIR - Ingredients of offence have not been prima facie established from the contents of FIR - Prima facie, it cannot be said that the appellant was guilty of having abetted the suicide within the meaning of Section 306 IPC The FIR recites that the spouse of the informant had a company carrying on the business of architecture, interior design and engineering consultancy. According to the informant, her husband was over the previous two years \"having pressure as he did not receive the money of work carried out by him\". The FIR recites that the deceased had called at the office of the appellant and spoken to his accountant for the payment of money. Apart from the above statements, it has been stated that the deceased left behind a suicide note stating that his \"money is stuck and following owners of respective companies are not paying our legitimate dues\". Prima facie, on the application of the test which has been laid down by the Supreme Court in a consistent line of authority, it cannot be said that the appellant was guilty of having abetted the suicide within the meaning of Section 306 IPC.

The High Court recited the legal position that the jurisdiction to quash under Section 482 has to be exercised sparingly. These words, however, are not meaningless incantations, but have to be assessed with reference to the contents of the particular FIR before the High Court. If the High Court were to carry out a prima facie evaluation, it would have been impossible for it not to notice the disconnect between the FIR and the provisions of Section 306 IPC. The failure of the High Court to do so has led it to adopting a position where it left the appellant to pursue his remedies for regular bail under Section 439. The High Court was clearly in error in failing to perform a duty which is entrusted to it while evaluating a petition under Section 482 albeit at the interim stage.

The High Court in the present case has misdirected itself in declining to enquire prima facie on a petition for quashing whether the parameters in the exercise of that jurisdiction have been duly established and if so whether a case for the grant of interim bail has been made out.

If the High Court were to have carried out this exercise, it would (as has been held in this judgment) have been apparent that the ingredients of the offence have not prima facie been established.

However, the High Court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of the power when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personal liberty in an excess of State power. (Para 63) While considering an application for the grant of bail under Article 226 in a suitable case, the High Court must consider the settled factors which emerge from the precedents of the Supreme Court. These factors can be summarised as follows: (i) The nature of the alleged offence, the nature of the accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case of a conviction. (ii) Whether there exists a reasonable apprehension of the accused tampering with the witnesses or being a threat to the complainant or the witnesses. (iii) The possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial or the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice. (iv) The antecedents of and circumstances which are peculiar to the accused. (v) Whether prima facie the ingredients of the offence are made out, on the basis of the allegations as they stand, in the FIR. (vi) The significant interests of the public or the State and other similar considerations. (Para 64) Prahlad Singh Bhati v.

The High Court must exercise its power with caution and circumspection, cognizant of the fact that this jurisdiction is not a ready substitute for recourse to the remedy of bail under Section 439 CrPC. In the backdrop of these principles, it has become necessary to scrutinise the contents of the FIR in the case at hand. In this batch of cases, a prima facie evaluation of the FIR does not establish the ingredients of the offence of abetment of suicide under Section 306 IPC. The appellants are residents of India and do not pose a flight risk during the investigation or the trial. There is no apprehension of tampering of evidence or witnesses. Taking these factors into consideration, the order dated 11-11-2020 envisaged the release of the appellants on bail. (Para 66) Arnab Manoranjan Goswami v. State of Maharashtra , (2021) 1 SCC 802, referred to Fair trial and investigation - Human liberty versus public interest - Allegation of malicious criminal proceedings - Duty of court Human liberty is a precious constitutional value, which is undoubtedly subject to regulation by validly enacted legislation.

Decisions of the Supreme Court require the High Courts, in exercising the jurisdiction entrusted to them under Section 482, to act with circumspection. In emphasising that the High Court must exercise this power with a sense of restraint, the decisions of the Supreme Court are founded on the basic principle that the due enforcement of criminal law should not be obstructed by the accused taking recourse to artifices and strategies. The public interest in ensuring the due investigation of crime is protected by ensuring that the inherent power of the High Court is exercised with caution. That indeed is one- and a significant- end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum is equally important: the recognition by Section 482 of the power inhering in the High Court to prevent the abuse of process or to secure the ends of justice is a valuable safeguard for protecting liberty. (Para 67) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was enacted by a legislature which was not subject to constitutional rights and limitations: yet it recognised the inherent power in Section 561-A. Post-Independence, the recognition by Parliament of the inherent power of the High Court continued under Section 482 CrPC, 1973 must be construed as an aid to preserve the constitutional value ofliberty. The writ of liberty runs through the fabric of the Constitution. The need to ensure the fair investigation of crime is undoubtedly important in itself, because it protects at one level the rights of the victim and, at a more fundamental level, the societal interest in ensuring that crime is investigated and dealt with in accordance with law. On the other hand, the misuse of the criminal law is a matter of which the High Court and the lower courts in this country must be alive. (Para 67) In the present case, the High Court could not but have been cognizant of the specific ground which was raised before it by the appellant that he was being made a target as a part of a series of occurrences which have been taking place since April 2020. The specific case of the appellant is that he has been targeted because his opinions on his television channel are unpalatable to authority. Whether the appellant has established a case for quashing the FIR is something on which the High Court will take a final view when the proceedings are listed before it but the court is clearly of the view that in failing to make even a prima facie evaluation of the FIR, the High Court abdicated its constitutional duty and function as a protector of liberty. (Para 67) Courts must be alive to the need to safeguard the public interest in ensuring that the due enforcement of criminal law is not obstructed. The fair investigation of crime is an aid to it. Equally it is the duty of courts across the spectrum- the district judiciary, the High Courts and the Supreme Court- to ensure that the criminal law does not become a weapon for the selective harassment of citizens. Courts should be alive to both ends of the spectrum- the need to ensure the proper enforcement of criminal law on the one hand and the need, on the other, of ensuring that the law does not become a ruse for targeted harassment. Liberty across human eras is as tenuous as tenuous can be. Liberty survives by the vigilance of her citizens, on the cacophony of the media and in the dusty corridors of courts alive to the rule of (and not by) law. Yet, much too often, liberty is a casualty when one of these components is found wanting.

State of Maharashtra, 2020 SCC OnLine Born 5447, cited Procedural hierarchy of courts vis-a-vis adjudicatory Junction of High Court Undoubtedly, the procedural hierarchy of courts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected. However, there was a failure of the High Court to discharge its adjudicatory function at two levels- first in declining to evaluate prima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR as to whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, in declining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render a prima facie opinion on the first. The High Court did have the power to protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking Article 226. Where the High Court has failed to do so, the Supreme Court would be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional court if it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interference being met. The doors of the Court cannot be closed to a citizen who is able to establish prima facie that the instrumentality of the State is being weaponised for using the force of criminal law. Our courts must ensure that they continue to remain the first line of defence against the deprivation of the liberty of citizens. Deprivation of liberty even for a single day is one day too many. The Court must always be mindful of the deeper systemic implications of its decisions. (Para 68) The basic entitlement of every citizen who is faced with allegations of criminal wrongdoing, is that the investigative process should be fair. This is an integral component of the guarantee against arbitrariness under Article 14 and of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. (Para 69) Romila Thapar v. Union of India, (2018) 10 SCC 753 : (2019) 1 SCC (Cri) 638, principle stated in para 79 thereof by Chandrachud, J., reiterated, being in line with precedents of Supreme Court Bail not jail - Duty of court The basic rule of our criminal justice system is \"bail, not jail\". The High Courts and courts in the district judiciary of India must enforce this principle in practice, and not forego that duty, leaving the Supreme Court to intervene at all times. The role of the district judiciary is important, which provides the first point of interface to the citizen. Our district judiciary is wrongly referred to as the \"subordinate judiciary\". It may be subordinate in hierarchy but it is not subordinate in terms of its importance in the lives of citizens or in terms of the duty to render justice to them. High Courts get burdened when courts of first instance decline to grant anticipatory bail or bail in deserving cases. This continues in the Supreme Court as well, when High Courts do not grant bail or anticipatory bail in cases falling within the parameters of the law. The consequence for those who suffer incarceration are serious. (Para 70) Common citizens without the means or resources to move the High Courts or the Supreme Court languish as undertrials.

As Judges, we would do well to remind ourselves that it is through the instrumentality of bail that our criminal justice system's primordial interest in preserving the presumption of innocence finds its most eloquent expression. The remedy of bail is the \"solemn expression of the humaneness of the justice system\". Tasked as the court is with the primary responsibility of preserving the liberty of all citizens, it cannot countenance an approach that has the consequence of applying this basic rule in an inverted form.

NJDG is a valuable resource for all High Courts to monitor the pendency and disposal of cases, including criminal cases. For Chief Justices of the High Courts, the information which is available is capable of being utilised as a valuable instrument to promote access to justice, particularly in matters concerning liberty. The Chief Justices of every High Court should in their administrative capacities utilise the ICT tools which are placed at their disposal in ensuring that access to justice is democratized and equitably allocated. Liberty is not a gift for the few. Administrative Judges in charge of districts must also use the facility to engage with the district judiciary and monitor pendency. As the data on NJDG makes clear, there is a pressing need for courts across the judicial hierarchy in India to remedy the institutional problem of bail applications not being heard and disposed of with expedition. (Para 72) It is hoped that the courts will exhibit acute awareness to the need to expand the footprint of liberty and use our approach as a decision-making yardstick for future cases involving the grant of bail.

While invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (\"CrPC\"), the appellant sought three substantive reliefs: 1.1. (i) A writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he had been illegally arrested and wrongfully detained by the Station House Officer (\"SHO\") at Alibaug Police Station in the district of Raigad in Maharashtra in relation to a first information report 1 (\"FIR\") registered on 5-5-2018 under Sections 306 and 34 of the Penal Code, 1860 (\"IPC\") in spite of an earlier closure report which was accepted by the Magistrate. 1.2. (ii) The quashing of the abovementioned FIR. 1.3. (iii) The quashing of the arrest memo on the basis of which the appellant had been arrested. 2. These three reliefs 2 are reflected in Prayers (a), (b) and (c) of the petition before the High Court. 1 CR No. 59 of2018 2 \"(a) Issue a writ of habeas corpus and/or any other similar writ, order and direction 9 of like nature, directing the respondents to produce the petitioner who has been illegally arrested and wrongfully detained by Respondent 2 in relation to FIR, being CR No . 59 of 2018 dated 5-5-2018, registered at Alibaug Police Station, Raigad, under Sections 306 and 34 of the Penal Code, 1860, despite a closure report being filed; (b) Issue a writ of mandamus and/or any other similar writ, order and direction of h like nature, quashing the FIR, being CR No . 59 of 2018, dated 5-5-2018, registered at Alibaug Police Station, Raigad, under Sections 306 and 34 of the Penal Code, 1860; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Pending the disposal of the petition, by an interim application in the proceedings 3, the appellant sought his release from custody and a stay of all further proceedings including the investigation in pursuance of the FIR. 4. A Division Bench of the High Court, by its order dated 9-11-2020 4 , noted that Prayer (a) by which a writ of habeas corpus was sought was not pressed. The High Court posted the hearing of the petition for considering the prayer for quashing of the FIR on 10-12-2020. It declined to accede to the prayer for the grant of bail, placing reliance on a decision of this Court in State of Telangana v. Habib Abdullah Jeelani 5 (\"Habib Jeelani\"). The High Court was of the view that the prayers for interim relief proceeded on the premise that the appellant had been illegally detained and since he was in judicial custody, it would not entertain the request for bail or for stay of the investigation in the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction. The High Court held that since the appellant was in judicial custody, it was open to him to avail of the remedy of bail under Section 439 CrPC. The High Court declined prima facie to consider the submission of the appellant that the allegations in the FIR, read as they stand, do not disclose the commission of an offence under Section 306 IPC. That is how the case has come to this Court. The appellant is aggrieved by the denial of his interim prayer for the grant of bail. B. The parties, the FIR and \"A\" Summary 5. The appellant is the Editor-in-Chief of an English television news channel, Republic TV. He is also the Managing Director of ARG Outlier Media Asianet News (Pvt.) Ltd. which owns and operates a Hindi television news channel by the name of R Bharat. The appellant anchors shows on both channels. 6. The appellant was arrested on 4-11-2020 in connection with FIR No. 59 of 2018 which was registered at Alibaug Police Station under Sections 306 and 34 IPC.

There is a \"suicide note\" holding the above three individuals responsible. 8.4. The informant was informed on 5-5-2018, when she and her daughter were at their residence at Mumbai, that her mother-in-law Kumud Naik had died at their Alibaug residence. On the way to Alibaug, she was informed that her husband had committed suicide. On reaching the house at Alibaug, she found the body of her mother-in-law lying on a bed and that her spouse had committed suicide by hanging. 9. On 6-5-2018, officers from Alibaug Police Station visited ARG's office in Mumbai and served three notices under Section 91 CrPC. On 7-5-2018 and 8-5-2018, two representatives of ARG visited Alibaug Police Station where they claim to have handed over the information which was sought by the police in their notices under Section 91. On 22-5-2018, the appellant submitted a representation to the notice under Section 91 following which on 30-5-2018 and 28-6-2018, the statements of the Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary of ARG were recorded. 10. On 16-4-2019, the SHO at Alibaug Police Station filed a report in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate (\"CJM\") for an \"A\" Summary. The CJM passed an order accepting the report and granted an \"A\" Summary. The meaning and import of an \"A\" Summary is reflected in Para 219(3) of the Bombay Police Manual , 1959. An \"A\" Summary indicates a case where an offence has been committed but it is undetected, in that there is no clue about the culprits or the property, or where the accused is known but there is no evidence to justify their being sent up to the Magistrate for trial. Para 219(3) of the Bombay Police Manual reads thus: \"Rule 219(3) of Bombay Police Manual (3) The final report should be written up carefully by the officers incharge of the police station personally and should be accompanied by all the case papers numbered and indexed methodically. If the accused has been released f on bail, the Magistrate should be requested to cancel the bail bond. He should also be requested to pass orders regarding the disposal of property attached, unless any of the articles, e.g., bloodstained clothes, are required for further use in true but undetected cases. A request should also be made to the Magistrate to classify the case and to issue an appropriate summary of his order viz.: \"A\" True. Undetected (where there is no clue whatsoever about the g culprits or property or where the accused in known but there is no evidence to justify his being sent up to the Magistrate (for trial). h \"B\" Maliciously false. \"C\" Neither true nor false, e.g., due to mistake of fact or being of a civil nature. \"Non-cognizable\" police investigation reveals commission of only non-cognizable offence.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

ARG by their letter dated 11-6-2019 , addressed to CDPL, the informant and her daughter, indicated that several meetings had been held in the past between them during the course of which ARG had sought indemnities from CDPL against any future claims. In its letter , ARG stated that it would be transferring a sum ofRs 39.01 lakhs into CDPL's last known bank account against an indemnity for future claims by the creditors or lenders of CDPL. In response, on 15-6-2019, the informant addressed a communication to ARG stating that out of a total billed amount of Rs 6.45 crores, an amount of Rs 5.75 crores had been received from ARG, and after adjustment of an amount of Rs 70.39 lakhs towards deductions made from the bill, an amount of Rs 88.02 lakhs was due and payable. On 6-11-2019, ARG addressed another letter to the informant recording the closure of the police investigation and reiterating its readiness to pay an amount of Rs 39.01 lakhs subject to due authorisation. The matter appears to have rested there until a flurry of developments took place in the month of April 2020. C. Previous proceedings against the appellant 12. During the course of the present proceedings, the appellant has adverted to proceedings initiated against him previously by the State of Maharashtra, in order to support his case that the arrest is vitiated by malice in fact. 13. On 16-4-2020, a broadcast took place on Republic TV, followed by a broadcast on Republic Bharat on 21-4-2020 in relation to an incident which took place in Gadchinchle Village of Palghar District in Maharashtra. During the course of this incident on 16-4-2020 , three persons, including two sadhus , were brutally killed by a mob, allegedly in the presence of the police and forest guard personnel. According to the appellant, on his news show titled \"Poochta hai Bharat\" on 21-4-2020, he had raised issues in relation to the allegedly tardy investigation of the incident by the police. 14. As this Court noticed in a judgment dated 19-5-2020 6 , the broadcasts led to the lodging of multiple FIRs and criminal complaints against the appellant in the States of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Jharkhand as well as in the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir. The content of the FIRs was similar, almost identical. In the State of Maharashtra, an FIR was lodged at Police Station Sadar, District N agpur City, details of which were as follows: \"M aharas htra a b C d e f FIR No. 238 of 2020 , dated 22-4-2020, registered at Police Station Sadar, District Nagpur City, Maharashtra, under Sections 153, 153-A, g 153-B, 295-A, 298, 500, 504(2), 506, 120-B and 117 of the Penal Code, 1860.\" Apart from the above FIR, fourteen other FIRs and complaints were lodged against the appellant in relation to his broadcasts. 6 Amab RanJa n Goswami v.

The appellant moved this Court in proceedings under Article 32 of the Constitution 7 challenging the registration of these FIRs. By an interim order dated 24-4-2020 8 , the FIR which had been lodged at Police Station Sadar, District Nagpur City was transferred to N.M. Joshi Marg Police Station, Mumbai and was renumbered as FIR No. 164 of 2020. Another FIR, FIR No. 137 of 2020, was registered against the appellant on 2-5-2020 at Pydhonie Police Station, Mumbai. FIR No. 137 of 2020 was filed against the appellant due to a telecast which took place on 29-4-2020 on the appellant's news channels, in which the appellant referred to a gathering of migrant workers at Bandra Railway Station during the Covrn-19 Pandemic, and attempted to connect a place of religious worship with this gathering. The appellant filed another petition under Article 32 of the Constitution 9 , challenging the registration of FIR No. 137 of 2020. 16. By its judgment dated 19-5-2020 6 , this Court quashed all the FIRs, except for the FIR which was transferred from N agpur to Mumbai, on the ground that successive FIRs/complaints in respect of the same cause could not be maintained. The Court granted liberty to the appellant to pursue such remedies as were available in law before the competent forum for quashing FIR No. 164 of 2020. 17. By an order dated 30-6-2020 10, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, while entertaining a petition under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution and Section 482 CrPC, suspended all further proceedings in FIR No. 164 of 2020 before N.M. Joshi Marg Police Station and FIR No. 137 of 2020 before Pydhonie Police Station and confirmed its interim order dated 6-6-2020 restraining the State from taking coercive steps against the appellant in relation to the two FIRs, pending the disposal of the petition. 18. Aside from this incident, the appellant has relied on certain other developments which have taken place thereafter. These are: 18.1. The arrest on 9-9-2020 by Maharashtra Police of two employees of the appellant's news channel alleged to be pursuing an investigative lead in Raigad, Maharashtra and the registration of FIR No. 142 of 2020 at Khalapur Police Station, Raigad under Sections 452, 448, 323, 504 and 506 read with Section 34 IPC. 18.2.

By an order dated 15-10-2020 12 , the writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to the appellant to approach the Bombay High Court. 18.9. The appellant filed Writ Petition (Crl.)

The High Court noted that the appellant had as on date not been arrayed as an accused in the FIR and if the investigating officer proposed to make an enquiry, a summons shall be issued to him. The appellant agreed to cooperate in the enquiry. D. Re-opening of investigation and arrest of the appellant 19. On 26-5-2020, the Home Department of the State of Maharashtra addressed a communication to Deputy Inspector General of Police stating that the FIR registered as Crime No. 59 of 2020, at Alibaug Police Station under Sections 306/34 IPC, was being transferred to the Crime Investigation Department \"for the purpose of reinvestigation\".

On 15-10-2020, the Local Crime Investigation Branch, Raigad addressed a communication to the CJM, Alibaug recording the commencement of further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC in respect of Crime No. 59 of 2018 under Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC. On 4-11-2020, the appellant was arrested at about 7.45 a.m. in connection with FIR No. 59 of 2018 dated 5-5-2018. At 2.37 p.m., the appellant filed a writ petition before the Bombay High Court, invoking the provisions of Articles 226/227 of the Constitution and Section 482 CrPC. 21. After the appellant's arrest, a remand application was filed before the CJM, Raigad. By an order dated 4-11-2020 , the CJM declined to grant police custody. Noting that there had been an \"A\" Summary previously, the CJM while rejecting the plea of police custody, remanded the appellant to judicial custody till 18-11-2020. The State has challenged the order of the CJM declining police custody in a revision before the Additional Sessions Judge, Raigad. 22. The writ petition filed by the appellant before the Bombay High Court was heard on 5-11-2020 14 , 6-11-2020 15 and 7-11-2020 16. On 7-11-2020 16, the High Court reserved orders and granted liberty to the appellant to file an application for regular bail under Section 439 CrPC with a direction that it should be heard expeditiously within four days of the date of filing. Following the above direction, the appellant moved the Sessions Court, Raigad for bail under Section 439 CrPC. By its impugned judgment and order dated 9-11-2020 4 , the High Court posted the hearing of the petition filed by the appellant in regard to the prayer of quashing of the FIR on 10-12-2020. While doing so, the High Court denied bail to the appellant on the ground that no case has been made out for the exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction and that the appellant had an alternate and efficacious remedy under Section 439 CrPC. E. Submissions of counsel 23. Assailing the order of the High Court denying bail to the appellant, Mr Harish N. Salve, learned Senior Counsel, submitted that: 23.1. The arrest of the appellant is rooted in malice in fact, which is evident f from the manner in which the appellant as the Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV and R Bharat has been targeted for his news broadcasts criticising the Maharashtra Government and the Maharashtra Police. 23.2. Following the acceptance of the police report and the issuance of an \"A\" Summary on 16-4-2019, the reinvestigation which has been ordered at the behest of the Home Minister of the State of Maharashtra is ultra vires. Further, 9 in the absence of the specific permission of the CJM, it was not open to the State to conduct a reinvestigation. 14 Arnab Goswami v.

The allegations contained in the FIR, read as they stand, do not establish an offence under Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC. To constitute the offence of abetment there must exist: (i) A direct or indirect incitement to the commission of a crime; (ii) An active role of the accused in instigating or doing an facilitating the commission of the crime; and (iii) The existence of a proximate relationship in time. act 24. In the present case, it was submitted that even if the allegations in the FIR are accepted as they stand, no case of abetment is established. It has been submitted that the company of the appellant (ARG) had entrusted a contract for interior work to the deceased's company (CDPL). Further, it is not in dispute that while an amount of Rs 5.45 crores has been paid, there was a commercial dispute pending in regard to the remaining payment between the two companies. The contents of the FIR also reveal that the deceased was suffering from mental pressure. Furthermore, there is absolutely no allegation that the appellant had either instigated or committed any act to facilitate the commission of the crime. 25. Mr Salve further submitted that the judgment of this Court in Habib Jeelani 5 has been wrongly interpreted by the High Court. It has been submitted that it was in pursuance of the liberty that was granted by the High Court, that an application for bail under Section 439 CrPC was filed. However, even on 9-11-2020, the Public Prosecutor has filed a note before the Sessions Judge that the revision application filed by the Stale against the order of the CJM should be heard first and it is only thereafter that the application for bail should be taken up. On the basis of the above submissions, it has been urged that the appellant has been made a target of the vendetta of the State Government, which emerges from the successive events adverted to above which have taken place since April 2020. Hence, it has been urged that there is absolutely no ground to continue the arrest of the appellant and absent any reasonable basis for depriving him of his liberty, an order for the grant of bail should have been passed by the High Court. Mr Salve finally submitted that the interest in preserving the procedural hierarchy of courts must give way to the need to protect the appellant's personal liberty given the well-settled legal position that the default rule is \"bail, not jail\". 26. Opposing the above submissions, Mr Amit Desai, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the second respondent submits that: 26.1. The High Court has advisably not enquired into whether: 26.1.1. The investigation is tainted by mala fides. 26.1.2. The contents of the FIR as they stand make out an offence within the meaning of Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC. 5 State of Telangana v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h ARNAB MANORANJAN GOSWAMI v. 453 STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Dr Chandrachud, J.) 26.2. The High Court declined to express a prima facie view on the issue of mala fides since an opportunity was being granted to the State to file its counter. Similarly, the issue as to whether the FIR is liable to be quashed would be taken up at the final hearing on 10-12-2020 and hence the High Court has correctly refrained from expressing a prima facie view. 26.3. Between 15-10-2020 and 4-11-2020, a further investigation has been carried out and statements have been recorded under Section 164 CrPC. 26.4. In accordance with this Court's judgment in Praveen Pradhan v. State of Uttaranchal 17 (\"Praveen Pradhan\"), instigation to commit suicide has to be gathered from the circumstances of a particular case. Hence, while there may not be direct evidence in regard to instigation which may have direct nexus to suicide, an inference has to be drawn from the circumstances to determine whether they were of a nature which created a situation in which a person felt totally frustrated and ended up committing suicide. Further, while making a determination as to the quashing of proceedings, the court has to form only a tentative opinion and not a firm view. 26.5. A hierarchy of courts is provided for to consider an application for bail under Section 439 CrPC. In the present case, there is no valid basis to bypass that hierarchy in order to grant relief to the appellant. 26.6. An application for bail was initially filed on behalf of the appellant which was withdrawn after the order for judicial custody was passed. An application for bail has been filed after the High Court while reserving judgment granted liberty to do so with a direction for its disposal within four days. Hence, it is appropriate that the appellant is relegated to pursue the remedies under Section 439. 26.7. Prayer (a) in the writ petition for the grant of a writ of habeas corpus was not maintainable in view of the fact that the appellant had been arrested and committed to judicial custody, and the interim application for his release on bail was only in the context of the prayer for habeas corpus. 26.8. During the course of the hearing of the proceedings before the Bombay High Court, the Division Bench indicated that if the appellant were to file an application under Section 439, appropriate administrative directions of the Chief Justice could be obtained for listing it before the Division Bench since applications for bail are placed for hearing before a Single Judge (while the petition was before a Division Bench) and the appellant had only filed an interim application in the pending writ petition for being released on bail. 26.9. Both the issue of whether the appellant has made out a case for quashing the FIR and whether a reinvestigation could have been ordered at the Home Department of the Stale would be considered by the High Court on 10-12-2020. 26.10. The High Court has drawn a balance between the rights of the accused and the family of the deceased victim. A substantive writ petition has 11 c2012) 9 sec 734: (2013) 1 sec (Cri) 146 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Even when \"A\" Summary has been accepted in terms of Para 219(3) of the Bombay Police Manual, there is no restraint on a further investigation being carried out by the investigating officer under Section 173(8) CrPC. An \"A\" Summary postulates that there was no completed investigation. Hence, requiring prior judicial sanction as a precondition for conducting further inv e stigation after the filing of an \"A\" Summary will impede the ability of investigating authorities to effectively perform their role. Such a course of action is also permissible in view of the decision of this Court in Vinubhai Haribhai Malaviya v. State of Gujarat 18 . 26.12. The High Court was justified in coming to the conclusion that there was nothing extraordinary in the facts of the present case to shock the conscience of the Court so as to take recourse to its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 to direct the release of the appellant on interim bail. Any other view would lead to the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 being extended to grant the remedy of an application for bail, which is already available under Section 439 CrPC. 27. In the same vein as the submissions which have been urged on behalf of the second respondent by Mr Amit Desai, Mr Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent, has submitted that the High Court has been justified in coming to the conclusion that there was no warrant to interfere in the course of the investigation in the present case. Mr Sibal also argued that Mr Salve has wrongly focused on other cases implicating the appellant in the course of his arguments. The learned Senior Counsel has urged that the appellant must pursue his remedy in accordance with law under Section 439 CrPC for which the liberty has been granted by the High Court. Further , Mr Sibal submitted that an \"A\" Summary is in fact not a closure report and investigation does not stand concluded. Hence , he submitted that the investigating officer was within jurisdiction in carrying out further investigation. Finally, Mr Sibal argued that while he is alive to the fact that the personal liberty of the appellant is at stake in the present case, this Court does refuse to interfere in many cases exhibiting similar features. Therefore, he argued that this Court should stay its hand in the present case. 28. Mr C. U. Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the fifth respondent, th e informant, has joined th e submissions of the first and second respondents in opposing these appeals. It was submitted that: 28.1. After the order of judicial remand on 4-11-2020, an application for bail was filed on behalf of the appellant and withdrawn. 28.2. On 7-11-2020, the Sessions Court issued a notice on the revision application filed by the State against the order declining to grant remand to police custody. 18 (2019) 11 sec 1 : (2020) 3 sec (Cri) 228 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On 7-11-2020 16, the High Court posted the proceedings for pronouncement ofjudgment on 9-11-2020 and granted liberty to the appellant to file an application for bail. Thereafter, an application for bail was filed on 8-11-2020 by the appellant. A special leave petition was filed in this Court th ereaft er. The High Court has correctly de clin e d to enquire into th e pl ea for quashing the FIR and the alleged mala fides on the ground that count ers are still to be filed. 28.4. On 15-10-2020, the Crime Detection Unit intimated the CJM that it was commencing further investigation on which the CJM has made an endorsement that it had been \"noted and filed\". Statements were recorded under Section 164 CrPC. Section 173(8) CrPC confers a broad power of further investigation on the investigating officer. Having regard to the context of an \"A\" Summary, this power has been legitimately exercised in the present case. The exercise of the power of further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC would not require judicial sanction. 29. Together with the present civil appeal, this Court has also heard submissions in two companion civil appeals. In the two companion appeals, submissions have been made before this Court by Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan and Mr Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Counsel. F. Criminal Appeal No. 743 of 2020 [arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 5599 of 2020] 30. Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Senior Counsel, submitted that the appeal has been filed by th e sister of Mr Feroz Shaikh who has been named as an accused. 31. Mr Feroz Shaikh is a Director in iCastX Technologies (Pvt.) Ltd. In 2016, iCastX Technologies hired the services of M/s Atos India (Pvt.) Ltd. for the work of construction, renovation and refurbishing of their office premises at Andheri East, Mumbai. Atos India (Pvt.) Ltd. in turn sub-contracted the work to CDPL. Hence, it has been submitted that there was privity of relationship between iCastX Technologies and CDPL. Mr Sankaranarayanan submitted that the three appellants represent the interest of three distinct individuals connected with three different compani e s. 32. Mr Sankaranarayanan has supported the submissions on the essential requirements of Section 107 IPC by relying on the decisions in Madan Mohan Singh v. State of Gujarat 19, Sunil Bharti Mittal v. CB/2° and Common Cause v. Union of lndia 21 (\" Common Cause\"). Mr Sankaranarayanan further argued that there was no reference about his client in the FIR filed on 5-5-2018 at the behest of the informant. Finally, he relied on this Court's judgment in Vineet Narain v. Union of lndia 22 to urge that executive interfer e nce in the course of an investigation or prosecution is impermissible. 16 Arnab Goswami v.

Mr Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, submitted that admittedly all the three accused named in the FIR are unconnected . The appellant is a Director in a (Pvt.) Ltd. company by the name of Smart Work Business Centre (Pvt.) Ltd. with less than one per cent of the shareholding standing in his own name. 34. The company which has offices in New Delhi and Kolkata had engaged the services of several vendors/contractors in order to furnish their business centre at Pune, one of whom was CDPL and a purchase order of Rs 4.17 crores was issued. Thereafter, there were substantial delays and discrepancies in the execution of the work by CDPL which led to an exchange of mails. Furthermore , an invoice of ov er Rs 5 crores was raised including an amount of Rs 83.02 lakhs towards GST. Pursuant to this, a payment of Rs 4.40 crores was made but there was a genuine commercial dispute between the two companies in relation to the remaining amount. 35. It has been submitted that on the face of it, there is no basis in the FIR to even remotely implicate the app ellant in the alleged offences under Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC. There is not even an indication of a personal interaction or connection between the appellant and the deceased. Furthermore , a civil suit regarding the disputed debt between their companies is pending. 36. The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution and Section 482 CrPC is in support of two distinct reliefs. The first relief is for a writ of habeas corpus. This relief has been claimed on the basis that the arrest and consequent detention of the appellant was due to a reinvestigation which was commenced after placing reliance on the Letter dated 26-5-2020 of the Home Department of the Government of Maharashtra to the Director General o f Police. The submission is that once the CJM accepted the report submitted by the investigating officer and issued an \" A\" Summary on 16-4-2019, it was not open to the investigating officer to commence a reinvestigation without judicial sanction. 37. Joining i ss ue with this submission is the argument of the State that the power of the investigating officer to order a further investigation under Section 173(8) CrPC is independent of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. In the view of the State, Section 4 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951 entrusts the superintendence of the police force to it and in the exercise of that power, it was legitimately open to the Home Department to direct a further investigation (though the letter uses the expression \"reinvestigation\") to be conducted based on the complaint of the victim that the offence had not been properly investigated. Moreover , the State has relied on the provisions of Section 36 CrPC under which police officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police station are entitled to exercise the same powers throughout the local area to which they are appointed. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

According to the appellant, when proceedings before the High Court came to be instituted, an order of remand had not been pas sed and it was only subsequently on the night of 4-11-2020 that an order granting judicial custody was passed by the CJM. Be that as it may, the High Court has recorded that Prayer (a) for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus was not pressed on behalf of the appellant. Once the prayer for a writ of habeas corpus was not pressed (as the High Court records), it was unnecessary for the High Court to devote several pages in the impugned judgment 4 on discussing the issue. 39. The remaining prayer before the High Court was for quashing the FIR. Mr Rohatgi submitted that the order of arrest is illegal and the appellant is entitled to have it so declared by invoking the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and Section 482 CrPC. It was urged that the power under Section 173(8) is to cause a \"further investigation\" and no power has been vested to either reinvestigate or cause a fresh investigation to be made. The power to reinvestigate or to cause fresh investigation, it was urged, is vested only in the constitutional courts. Contrary to the provisions of Section 173(8), it was urged , the Home Department in its letter to the Deputy Inspector General has directed a reinvestigation. In the present case, the communication of the Home Department makes it abundantly clear that a reinvestigation was ordered under the authority of the State Home Minister which, according to the submission, is ultra vires the provisions of law. Mr Rohatgi has emphasised that the application for remand makes it clear that what is ordered was a reinvestigation, since the application has repeatedly used the expression \"comprehensive reinvestigation\" and the fact that \"reinvestigation has become necessary\". 40. Finally, it was urged that the order of the Home Minister in the State was issued on 26-5-2020 whereas the investigation commenced on 15-10-2020 and the arrest was made on 4-11-2020 in respect of an FIR lodged in May 2018 on which an \"A\" Summary had been accepted on 16-4-2019. In sum and substance, it has been submitted that after the order of closure on 16-4-2019, a reinvestigation could not have been ordered in the case. The arrest has been termed unlawful. H. Jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution and Section 482 CrPC 41. While considering the rival submissions, it is essential for the purpose of the present appeals to elucidate on the nature of the jurisdiction that is g vested in the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution and Section 482 CrPC. This issue must be analysed from the perspective of the position that the proceeding before the High Court, after the prayer for the grant of a writ of habeas corpus was given up, is for quashing the FIR being CR No. 59 of 2018 lodged on 5-5-2018. h 4 Arnab Manoranjan Goswami v.

The High Court has dwelt at length on the decision of this Court in Habib Jeelani 5 • The High Court observed that the powers to quash \"are to be exercised sparingly and that too, in rare and appropriate cases and in extreme circumstances to prevent abuse of process of law\". Applying this principle, the High Court opined 4 : (Arnab Manoranjan Goswami case 4 , SCC OnLine Born para 47) \"47. The principle stated therein will equally apply to the exercise of this Court's power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure while considering the applications for bail since the petitioner is already in judicial custody. The legislature has provided specific remedy under Section 439 CrPC for applying for regular bail. Having regard to the alternate and efficacious remedy available to the petitioner under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this Court has to exercise judicial restraint while entertaining application in the nature of seeking regular bail in a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.\" On the basis of the above foundation, the High Court has declined to even prima facie enquire into whether the allegations contained in the FIR, read as they stand, attract the provisions of Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC. In its view, since the petition was being posted for hearing on 10-12-2020, it was not inclined to enquire into this aspect of the case and the appellant would be at liberty to apply for regular bail under Section 439. 43. Now, it is in this background that it becomes necessary for this Court to evaluate what, as a matter of principle, is the true import of the decision of this Court in Habib Jeelani 5 . This was a case where, on the basis of a report under Section 154 CrPC, an FIR was registered for offences punishable under Sections 147, 148, 149 and 307 IPC. Challenging the initiation of the criminal action, the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to quash an FIR was invoked. The High Court [as para 2 of the judgment of this Court in Habib Jeelani 5 indicates] expressed 23 its \"disinclination to interfere on the ground that it was not appropriate to stay the investigation of the case\". It was in this background that the following issue was formulated in the first paragraph of the judgment of this Court, speaking through Dipak Misra, J. (as he then was), for consideration: (Habib Jeelani case 5, sec p. 783, para 1) \"l. The seminal issue that arises for consideration in this appeal, by special leave, is whether the High Court while refusing to exercise inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to interfere in an application for quashment of the investigation, can restrain the investigating agency not to arrest the accused persons during the course of investigation.\" 5 State of Telangana v.

Between paras 11 and 15, this Court then evaluated the nature of the jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC or under Article 226 of the Constitution for quashing an FIR and observed: (Habib Jeelani case 5 , SCC pp. 787-89) \"l 1. Once an FIR is registered, the accused persons can always approach the High Court under Section 482 CrPC or under Article 226 of the Constitution for quashing of the FIR. In Bhajan Lal 24 the two-Judge Bench after referring to Hazari Lal Gupta v. Rameshwar Prasad2 5, Jehan Singh v. Delhi Admn. 26 , Amar Nath v. State of Haryana 27 , Kurukshetra University v. State of Haryana 28 , State of Bihar v. J.A. C. Saldanha 29 , State ofWB. v. Swapan Kumar Guha 30 , Nagawwa v. V.S. Konjalgi 31 , Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre 32 , State of Bihar v. Murad Ali Khan 33 and some other authorities that had dealt with the contours of exercise of inherent powers of the High Court, thought it appropriate to mention certain category of cases by way of illustration wherein the extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution or inherent power under Section 482 CrPC could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The Court also observed that it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad cases wherein such power should be exercised. 12. The illustrations given by the Court need to be recapitulated: (Bhajan Lal case 24 , SCC pp. 378-79, para 102) '(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code. 5 State of Telangana v.

(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fides and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.' It is worthy to note that the Court has clarified that the said parameters or guidelines are not exhaustive but only illustrative. Nevertheless, it throws light on the circumstances and situations where the Court's inherent power can be exercised. 13. There can be no dispute over the proposition that inherent power in a matter of quashment of FIR has to be exercised sparingly and with caution and when and only when such exercise is justified by the test specifically laid down in the provision itself. There is no denial of the fact that the power under Section 482 CrPC is very wide but it needs no special emphasis to state that conferment of wide power requires the Court to be more cautious. It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the Court. 14. In this regard , it would be seemly to reproduce a passage from Kurukshetra University 28 wherein Chandrachud, J. (as his Lordship then was) opined thus: (SCC p. 451, para 2) '2. It surprises us in the extreme that the High Court thought that in the exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it could quash a first information report. The police had not even commenced investigation into the complaint filed by the Warden of the University and no proceeding at all was pending in any court in pursuance of the FIR. It ought to be realised that inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act 28 Kuruksh etra Univ ersity v.

We have referred to the said decisions only to stress upon the issue, how the exercise of jurisdiction by the High Court in a proceeding relating to quashment of FIR can be justified. We repeat even at the cost of repetition that the said power has to be exercised in a very sparing manner and is not to be used to choke or smother the prosecution that is legitimate. The surprise that was expressed almost four decades ago in Kurukshetra University case 28 compels us to observe that we are also surprised by the impugned order 22 .\" 45. Thereafter, this Court noted that \"the High Court has not referred to allegations made in the FIR or what has come out in the investigation\". While on the one hand, the High Court declined in exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 to quash the proceedings, it nonetheless directed the police not to arrest the appellants during the pendency of the investigation. It was in this context that this Court observed that the High Court had, while dismissing the applications under Section 482, passed orders that if the accused surrenders before the trial Magistrate, he shall be admitted to bail on such terms and conditions as it was deemed fit and appropriate. 46. After adverting to the earlier decision in Hema Mishra v. State of U.P. 34 , this Court observed: (SCC p. 793, para 23) \"23. We have referred to the authority in Hema Mishra 34 as that specifically deals with the case that came from the State of Uttar Pradesh where Section 438 CrPC has been deleted. It has concurred with the view expressed in Lal Kamlendra Pratap Singh 35 . The said decision, needless to say, has to be read in the context of the State of Uttar Pradesh. We do not intend to elaborate the said principle as that is not necessary in this case. What needs to be stated here is that the States where Section 438 CrPC has not been deleted and kept on the statute book, the High Court should be well advised that while entertaining petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution or Section 482 CrPC, it exercises judicial restraint. We may hasten to clarify that the Court, if it thinks fit, regard being had to the parameters of quashing and the self-restraint imposed by law, has the jurisdiction to quash the investigation and may pass appropriate interim orders as thought apposite in law, but it is absolutely inconceivable and unthinkable to pass an order of the present nature while declining to interfere or expressing opinion that it is not appropriate to stay the investigation. This kind of order is really inappropriate and unseemly. It has no sanction in law. The courts should oust and obstruct unscrupulous 28 Kurukshetra University v.

It is the obligation of the Court to keep such unprincipled and unethical litigants at bay.\" 47. The above decision thus arose in a situation where the High Court had declined to entertain a petition for quashing an FIR under Section 482 CrPC. However, it nonetheless directed the investigating agency not to arrest the accused during the pendency of the investigation. This was held to be impermissible by this Court. On the other hand, this Court clarified that the High Court if it thinks fit, having regard to the parameters for quashing and the self-restraint imposed by law, has the jurisdiction to quash the investigation \"and may pass appropriate interim orders as thought apposite in law\". Clearly therefore, the High Court in the present case has misdirected itself in declining to enquire prima facie on a petition for quashing whether the parameters in the exercise of that jurisdiction have been duly established and if so whether a case for the grant of interim bail has been made out. The settled principles which have been consistently reiterated since the judgment of this Court in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal 24 (\"Bhajan Lal\") include a situation where the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. This legal position was recently reiterated in a decision by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Kamal Shivaji Pokarnekar v. State of Maharashtra 36 • I. Primafacie evaluation of the FIR and the grant of bail 48. The striking aspect of the impugned judgment 4 of the High Court spanning over fifty-six pages is the absence of any evaluation even prima facie of the most basic issue. The High Court, in other words, failed to apply its mind to a fundamental issue which needed to be considered while dealing with a petition for quashing under Article 226 of the Constitution or Section 482 CrPC. The High Court, by its judgment dated 9-11-2020 4 , has instead allowed the petition for quashing to stand over for hearing a month later, and therefore declined to allow the appellant's prayer for interim bail and relegated him to the remedy under Section 439 CrPC. In the meantime, liberty has been the casualty. The High Court having failed to evaluate prima facie whether the allegations in the FIR, taken as they stand, bring the case within the fold of Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC, this Court is now called upon to perform the task. 49. Before we evaluate the contents of the FIR, a reference to Section 306 IPC is necessary.

Section 107 is comprised within a Chapter V IPC, which is titled \"Of Abetment\". Section 107 provides: b C \"107. Abetment of a thing.-A person abets the doing of a thing, who- First.-Instigates any person to do that thing; or Secondly.-Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or Thirdly.-Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. Explanation 1.-A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. Illustration A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B d abets by instigation the apprehension of C. e f g h Explanation 2.-Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.\" 50. The first segment of Section 107 defines abetment as the instigation of a person to do a particular thing. The second segment defines it with reference to engaging in a conspiracy with one or more other persons for the doing of a thing, and an act or illegal omission in pursuance of the conspiracy. Under the third segment, abetment is founded on intentionally aiding the doing of a thing either by an act or omission. These provisions have been construed specifically in the context of Section 306 to which a reference is necessary in order to furnish the legal foundation for assessing the contents of the FIR. These provisions have been construed in the earlier judgments of this Court in State of W.B. v. Orilal Jaiswal 38 , Randhir Singh v. State of Punjab 39 , Kishori Lal v.

It is also to be borne in mind that in cases of alleged abetment of suicide there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of harassment without there being any positive action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused which led or compelled the person to commit suicide, conviction in terms of Section 306 IPC is not sustainable.\" 51. The Court noted that before a person may be said to have abetted the commission of suicide, they \"must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide\". Instigation, as this Court held in Kishori Lal 40 , \"literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about by persuasion to do anything\". In S.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan 43 , a two-Judge Bench of this Court, speaking through Dalveer Bhandari, J., observed: (SCC p. 197, para 25) \"25. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases decided by this Court is clear that in order to convict a person under Section 306 IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and that act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed suicide.\" 52. Madan Mohan Singh v. State of Gujarat44 was specifically a case which arose in the context of a petition under Section 482 CrPC where the High Court had dismissed 45 the petition for quashing an FIR registered for offences under Sections 306 and 294(b) IPC. In that case, the FIR was registered on a complaint of the spouse of the deceased who was working as a driver with the accused. The driver had been rebuked by the employer and was later found to be dead on having committed suicide. A suicide note was relied upon in the FIR, the contents of which indicated that the driver had not been given a fixed vehicle unlike other drivers besides which he had other complaints including the deduction of 15 days' wages from his salary. The suicide note named the appellant-accused. In the decision of a two-Judge Bench of this Court, delivered by V.S. Sirpurkar, J., the test laid down in Bhajan Lal2 4 was applied and the Court held: (Madan Mohan Singh case 44 , SCC p. 631, paras 10-11) \"10.

We could not find anything in the FIR or in the so-called suicide note which could be suggested as abetment to commit suicide. In such matters there must be an allegation that the accused had instigated the deceased to commit suicide or secondly, had engaged with some other person in a conspiracy and lastly , that the accused had in any way aided any act or illegal omission to bring about the suicide. 11. In spite of our best efforts and microscopic examination of the suicide note and the FIR, all that we find is that the suicide note is a rhetoric document in the nature of a departmental complaint. It also suggests some mental imbalance on the part of the deceased which he himself describes as depression. In the so-called suicide note, it cannot be said that the accused ever intended that the driver under him should commit suicide or should end his life and did anything in that behalf. Even if it is accepted that the accused changed the duty of the driver or that the accused asked him not to take the keys of the car and to keep the keys of the car in the office itself, it does not mean that the accused intended or knew that the driver should commit suicide because of this.\" 53. Dealing with the provisions of Section 306 IPC and the meaning of abetment within the meaning of Section 107, the Court observed: (Madan Mohan Singh case 44 , SCC pp. 631-32, para 12) \"12. In order to bring out an offence under Section 306 IPC specific abetment as contemplated by Section 107 IPC on the part o f the accused with an intention to bring about the suicide of the person concerned as a result of that abetment is required. The intention of the accused to aid or to instigate or to abet the deceased to commit suicide is a must for this particular offence under Section 306 IPC. We are of the clear opinion that there is no question of there being any material for offence under Section 306 IPC either in the FIR or in the so-called suicide note.\" The Court noted that the suicide note expressed a state of anguish of the deceased and \"cannot be depicted as expressing anything intentional on the part of the accused that the deceased might commit suicide\". Reversing the judgment 45 of the High Court, the petition under Section 482 was allowed and the FIR was quashed. 54. In a concurring judgment delivered by one of us (Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, J.) in the decision of the Constitution Bench in Common Cause 21 , the provisions of Section 107 were explained with the following observations: (SCC p. 244, para 458) \"458.

It presupposes a course of conduct or action which (in the context of the present discussion) facilitates another to end life. Hence abetment of suicide is an offence expressly punishable under Sections 305 and 306 IPC.\" 55. More recently in M. Arjunan v. State 46 , a two-Judge Bench of this Court, speaking through R. Banumathi, J., elucidated the essential ingredients of the offence under Section 306 IPC in the following observations: (SCC p. 317, para 7) \"7. The essential ingredients of the offence under Section 306 IPC are: (i) the abetment; (ii) the intention of the accused to aid or instigate or abet the deceased to commit suicide. The act of the accused , however, insulting the deceased by using abusive language will not, by itself, constitute the abetment of suicide. There should be evidence capable of suggesting that the accused intended by such act to instigate the deceased to commit suicide. Unless the ingredients of instigation/abetment to commit suicide are satisfied the accused cannot be convicted under Section 306 IPC.\" 56. Similarly, in another recent judgment of this Court in Ude Singh v. State of Haryana 47 , a two-Judge Bench of this Court, speaking through Dinesh Maheshwari, J., expounded on the ingredients of Section 306 IPC, and the factors to be considered in determining whether a case falls within the ken of the aforesaid provision, in the following terms: (SCC pp. 321-22, para 16) \"16. In cases of alleged abetment of suicide, there must be a proof of direct or indirect act(s) of incitement to the commission of suicide. It could hardly be disputed that the question of cause of a suicide, particularly in the context of an offence of abetment of suicide, remains a vexed one, involving multifaceted and complex attributes of human behaviour and responses/ reactions. In the case of accusation for abetment of suicide, the court would be looking for cogent and convincing proof of the act(s) ofincitement to the commission of suicide. In the case of suicide, mere allegation of harassment of the deceased by another person would not suffice unless there be such action on the part of the accused which compels the person to commit suicide; and such an offending action ought to be proximate to the time of occurrence. Whether a person has abetted in the commission of suicide by another or not, could only be gathered from the facts and circumstances of each case. 16. J. For the purpose of finding out if a person has abetted commission of suicide by another, the consideration would be if the accused is guilty of the act of instigation of the act of suicide. As explained and reiterated by this Court in the decisions abovereferred, instigation means to goad , urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do an act. If the persons who committed suicide had been hypersensitive and the action of accused 46 (2019) 3 sec 315: (2019 ) 2 sec (Cri) 219 47 (2019) 11 sec 301 : c2020) 3 sec (Cri) 306 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

But, on the other hand, if the accused by his acts and by his continuous course of conduct creates a situation which leads the deceased perceiving no other option except to commit suicide, the case may fall within the four-corners of Section 306 IPC. If the accused plays an active role in tarnishing the self-esteem and self-respect of the victim, which eventually draws the victim to commit suicide, the accused may be held guilty of abetment of suicide. The question of mens rea on the part of the accused in such cases would be examined with reference to the actual acts and deeds of the accused and if the acts and deeds are only of such nature where the accused intended nothing more than harassment or snap show of anger, a particular case may fall short of the offence of abetment of suicide. However, if the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words or deeds until the deceased reacted or was provoked, a particular case may be that of abetment of suicide. Such being the matter of delicate analysis of human behaviour, each case is required to be examined on its own facts, while taking note of all the surrounding factors having bearing on the actions and psyche of the accused and the deceased.\" 57. Similarly, in Rajesh v. State of Haryana 48 , a two-Judge Bench of this Court, speaking through L. Nageswara Rao, J., held as follows: (SCC para 9) \"9. Conviction under Section 306 IPC is not sustainable on the allegation of harassment without there being any positive action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused, which led or compelled the person to commit suicide. In order to bring a case within the purview of Section 306 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the person who is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of abetment by the person charged with the said offence must be proved and established by the prosecution before he could be convicted under Section 306 IPC.\" 58. In a recent decision of this Court in Gurcharan Singh v. State of Punjab 49 , a three-Judge Bench of this Court, speaking through Hrishikesh Roy, J., held thus: (SCC pp. 206-07, para 15) \"15. As in all crimes, mens rea has to be established. To prove the offence of abetment, as specified under Section 107 IPC, the state of mind to commit a particular crime must be visible, to determine the culpability. In order to prove mens rea, there has to be something on record to establish or show that the appellant herein had a guilty mind and in furtherance of that state of mind, abetted the suicide of the deceased.\" 48 (2020) 15 sec 359 49 (2020) 10 sec 200 : (2021) 1 sec (Cri) 417 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 468 SUPREME COURT CASES c2021) 2 sec 59. In Vaijnath Kondiba Khandke v. State of Maharashtra 50 , a two-Judge Bench of this Court, speaking through U.U. Lalit, J., dealt with an appeal against the rejection of an application under Section 482 CrPC, for quashing an FIR registered under Sections 306 and 506 read with Section 34 IPC. A person serving in the office of the Deputy Director of Education, Aurangabad had committed suicide on 8-8-2017. His wife made a complaint to the police that her husband was suffering from mental torture as his superiors were getting heavy work done from her husband. This resulted in him having to work from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and even at odd hours and on holidays. The specific allegation against the appellant was that he had stopped the deceased's salary for one month and was threatening the deceased that his increment would be stopped. This Court noted that there was no suicide note, and the only material on record was in the form of assertions made by the deceased' s wife in her report to the police. The Court went on to hold that the facts on record were inadequate and insufficient to bring home the charge of abetment of suicide under Section 306 IPC. The mere factum of work being assigned by the appellant to the deceased, or the stoppage of salary for a month, was not enough to prove criminal intent or guilty mind. Consequently, proceedings against the appellant were quashed. 60. On the other hand, we must also notice the decision in Praveen Pradhan 17 where a two-Judge Bench of this Court, speaking through B.S. Chauhan, J., dismissed an appeal against the rejection 51 of an application under Section 482 CrPC by the High Court for quashing a criminal proceeding, implicating an offence under Section 306 IPC. The suicide note which was left behind by the deceased showed, as this Court observed, that \"the appellant perpetually humiliated, exploited and demoralised the deceased, who was compelled to indulge in wrongful practices at the workplace, which hurt his self-respect tremendously.\" The Court noted that the appellant always scolded the deceased and tried to always force the deceased to resign. Resultantly, the Court observed: (SCC p. 741, para 19) \"19. Thus, the case is required to be considered in the light of the aforesaid settled legal propositions. In the instant case, alleged harassment had not been a casual feature, rather remained a matter of persistent harassment. It is not a case of a driver; or a man having an illicit relationship with a married woman, knowing that she also had another paramour; and therefore, cannot be compared to the situation of the deceased in the instant case, who was a qualified graduate engineer and still suffered persistent harassment and humiliation and additionally, also had to endure continuous illegal demands made by the appellant, upon nonfulfilment of which, he would be mercilessly harassed by the appellant for a prolonged period of time. He had also been forced to work continuously for long durations in the factory, vis-a-vis other employees which often even entered to 16-17 hours at a stretch.

Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, we do not think it is a case which requires any interference by this Court as regards the impugned judgment and order 51 of the High Court. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed accordingly.\" The contents of the FIR, therefore, indicated that the deceased had been subjected to harassment persistently and continuously and this was coupled by words used by the accused which led to the commission of suicide. 61. In Narayan Malhari Thorat v. Vinayak Deorao Bhagat 52 , this Court, speaking through U.U. Lalit, J., reversed the judgment 53 of a Division Bench of the High Court which had quashed criminal proceedings in exercise of the jurisdiction under Section 482. This was a case where the FIR was registered pursuant to the information received from the appellant. The FIR stated that the son and daughter-in-law of the appellant were teachers in Zila Parishad School. The respondent used to call the daughter-in-law of the appellant on the phone and used to harass her. Moreover, despite the efforts of the son of the appellant, the respondent did not desist from doing so. This Court noted: (SCC p. 603, para 12) \"12. We now consider the facts of the present case. There are definite allegations that the first respondent would keep on calling the wife of the victim on her mobile and keep harassing her which allegations are supported by the statements of the mother and the wife of the victim recorded during investigation. The record shows that 3-4 days prior to the suicide there was an altercation between the victim and the first respondent. In the light of these facts, coupled with the fact that the suicide note made definite allegation against first respondent, the High Court was not justified in entering into question whether the first respondent had the requisite intention to aid or instigate or abet the commission of suicide. At this juncture when the investigation was yet to be completed and charge-sheet, if any, was yet to be filed, the High Court ought not to have gone into the aspect whether there was requisite mental element or intention on part of the respondent.\" The above observations of the Court clearly indicated that there was a specific allegation in the FIR bearing on the imputation that the respondent had actively facilitated the commission of suicide by continuously harassing the spouse of the victim and in failing to rectify his conduct despite the efforts of the victim. 62. Now in this backdrop, it becomes necessary to advert briefly to the contents of the FIR in the present case. The FIR recites that the spouse of the informant had a company carrying on the business of architecture, interior 51 Praveen Pradhan v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 470 SUPREME COURT CASES c2021) 2 sec design and engineering consultancy. According to the informant, her husband was over the previous two years \"having pressure as he did not receive the money of work carried out by him\". The FIR recites that the deceased had called at the office of the appellant and spoken to his accountant for the payment of money. Apart from the above statements, it has been stated that the deceased left behind a suicide note stating that his \"money is stuck and following owners of respective companies are not paying our legitimate dues\". Prima facie, on the application of the test which has been laid down by this Court in a consistent line of authority which has been noted above, it cannot be said that the appellant was guilty of having abetted the suicide within the meaning of Section 306 IPC. These observations, we must note, are prima facie at this stage since the High Court is still to take up the petition for quashing. Clearly however, the High Court in failing to notice the contents of the FIR and to make a prima facie evaluation abdicated its role, functions and jurisdiction when seized of a petition under Section 482 CrPC. The High Court recited the legal position that the jurisdiction to quash under Section 482 has to be exercised sparingly. These words, however, are not meaningless incantations, but have to be assessed with reference to the contents of the particular FIR before the High Court. If the High Court were to carry out a prima facie evaluation, it would have been impossible for it not to notice the disconnect between the FIR and the provisions of Section 306 IPC. The failure of the High Court to do so has led it to adopting a position where it left the appellant to pursue his remedies for regular bail under Section 439. The High Court was clearly in error in failing to perform a duty which is entrusted to it while evaluating a petition under Section 482 albeit at the interim stage. 63. The petition before the High Court was instituted under Article 226 of the Constitution and Section 482 CrPC. While dealing with the petition under Section 482 for quashing the FIR, the High Court has not considered whether prima facie the ingredients of the offence have been made out in the FIR. If the High Court were to have carried out this exercise, it would (as we have held in this judgment) have been apparent that the ingredients of the offence have not prima facie been established. As a consequence of its failure to perform its function under Section 482, the High Court has disabled itself from exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 to consider the appellant's application for bail. In considering such an application under Article 226, the High Court must be circumspect in exercising its powers on the basis of the facts of each case. However, the High Court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of the power when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personal liberty in an excess of State power. 64. While considering an application for the grant of bail under Article 226 in a suitable case, the High Court must consider the settled factors which emerge from the precedents of this Court. These factors can be summarised as follows: 64.1. The nature of the alleged offence, the nature of the accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case of a conviction. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Whether prima facie the ingredients of the offence are made out, on the basis of the allegations as they stand, in the FIR. 64.6. The significant intere sts of the public or the State and other similar considerations. 65. These principles have evolved over a period of time and emanate from the following (among other) decisions: Prahlad Singh Bhati v. State (NCT of Delhi) 54 ; Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh 55 ; State of U.P. v. Amarmani Tripathi 56 ; Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. As his Chatterjee 57 ; San jay Chandra v. CBP 8 and P. Chidambaram v. CBP 9 . 66. These principles are equally applicable to the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution when the court is called upon to secure the liberty of the accused. The High Court must exercise its power with caution and circumspection, cognizant of the fact that this jurisdiction is not a ready substitute for recourse to the remedy of bail under Section 439 CrPC. In the backdrop of these principles, it has become necessary to scrutinise the contents of the FIR in the case at hand. In this batch of cases, a prima facie evaluation of the FIR does not establish the ingredients of the offence of abetment of suicide under Section 306 IPC. The appellants are residents of India and do not pose a flight risk during the investigation or the trial. There is no apprehension of tampering of evidence or witnesses. Taking these factors into consideration, the order dated 11-11-2020 60 envisaged the release of the appellants on bail. J. Human liberty and the Role of courts 67. Human liberty is a precious constitutional value, which is undoubtedly subject to regulation by validly enacted legislation. As such, the citizen is subject to the edicts of criminal law and procedure. Section 482 recognises the inherent power of the High Court to make such orders as are necessary to give effect to the provisions of CrPC \"or prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice\". Decisions of this Court require the High Courts, in exercising the jurisdiction entrusted to them under Section 482 , to act with circumspection.

The public a interest in ensuring the due investigation of crime is protected by ensuring that the inherent power of the High Court is exercised with caution. That indeed is one-and a significant-end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum is equally important: the recognition by Section 482 of the power inhering in the High Court to prevent the abuse of process or to secure the ends of justice is a valuable safeguard for protecting liberty. The Code of Criminal Procedure, b 1898 was enacted by a legislature which was not subject to constitutional rights and limitations; yet it recognised the inherent power in Section 561-A. Post- Independence, the recognition by Parliament 61 of the inherent power of the High Court must be construed as an aid to preserve the constitutional value of liberty. The writ of liberty runs through the fabric of the Constitution. The need to ensure the fair investigation of crime is undoubtedly important in c itself, because it protects at one level the rights of the victim and, at a more fundamental level, the societal interest in ensuring that crime is investigated and dealt with in accordance with law. On the other hand, th e misuse of the criminal law is a matter of which the High Court and the lower courts in this country must be alive. In the present case, the High Court could not but have been cognizant of the specific ground which was raised before it by the appellant that d he was being made a target as a part of a series of occurrences which have been taking place since April 2020. The specific case of the appellant is that he has been targeted because his opinions on his television channel are unpalatable to authority. Whether the appellant has established a case for quashing the FIR is something on which the High Court will take a final view when the proceedings are listed before it but we are clearly of the view that in failing to make even a e prima facie evaluation of the FIR, the High Court abdicated its constitutional duty and function as a protector of liberty. Courts must be alive to the need to safeguard the public interest in ensuring that the due enforcement of criminal law is not obstructed. The fair investigation of crime is an aid to it. Equally it is the duty of courts across the spectrum-the district judiciary, the High Courts and the Supreme Court-to ensure that the criminal law does not become a f weapon for the selective harassment of citizens. Courts should be alive to both ends of the spectrum-the need to ensure the proper enforcement of criminal law on the one hand and the need, on the other, of ensuring that the law does not become a ruse for targeted harassment. Liberty across human eras is as tenuous as tenuous can be. Liberty survives by the vigilance of her citizens, on the cacophony of the media and in the dusty corridors of courts alive to the rule g of(and not by) law. Yet , much too often, liberty is a casualty when one of these components is found wanting. 68. Mr Kapil Sibal, Mr Amit Desai and Mr Chander Uday Singh are undoubtedly right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy of courts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected.

The High Court did have the power to protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking Article 226. Where the High Court has failed to do so, this Court would be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional court if it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interference being met. The doors of this Court cannot be closed to a citizen who is able to establish prima facie that the instrumentality of the State is being weaponised for using the force of criminal law. Our courts must ensure that they continue to remain the first line of defence against the deprivation of the liberty of citizens. Deprivation of liberty even for a single day is one day too many. We must always be mindful of the deeper systemic implications of our decisions. 69. It would be apposite to extract the observations made, albeit in a dissenting opinion, by one ofus (Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, J.) in a decision of a three-Judge Bench in Romila Thapar v. Union of lndia 62 : (SCC p. 796, para 79) \"79 . ... [T]he basic entitlement of every citizen who is faced with allegations of criminal wrongdoing, is that the investigative process should be fair. This is an integral component of the guarantee against arbitrariness under Article 14 and of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21. If this Court were not to stand by the principles which we have formulated, we may witness a soulful requiem to liberty.\" The decision was a dissent in the facts of the case. The view of the leading majority judgment is undoubtedly the view of the Court, which binds us. However, the principle quoted above is in line with the precedents of this Court. 70. More than four decades ago, in a celebrated judgment in State of Rajasthan v. Balchand 63 , Krishna Iyer, J. pithily reminded us that the basic rule of our criminal justice system is \"bail, not jail\" 64 . The High Courts and courts in the district judiciary of India must enforce this principle in practice, and not forego that duty, leaving this Court to intervene at all times. We must in particular also emphasise the role of the district judiciary, which provides the first point of interface to the citizen. Our district judiciary is wrongly referred to as the \"subordinate judiciary\".

High Courts get burdened when courts of first instance decline to grant anticipatory bail or bail in deserving cases. This continues in the Supreme Court as well, when High Courts do not grant bail or anticipatory bail in cases falling within the parameters of the law. The consequence for those who suffer incarceration are serious. Common citizens without the means or resources to move the High Courts or this Court languish as undertrials. Courts must be alive to the situation as it prevails on the ground- in the jails and police stations where human dignity has no protector. As Judges, we would do well to remind ourselves that it is through the instrumentality of bail that our criminal justice system's primordial interest in preserving the presumption of innocence finds its most eloquent expression. The remedy of bail is the \"solemn expression of the humaneness of the justice system\" 65 . Tasked as we are with the primary responsibility of preserving the liberty of all citizens, we cannot countenance an approach that has the consequence of applying this basic rule in an inverted form. We have given expression to our anguish in a case where a citizen has approached this Court. We have done so in order to reiterate principles which must govern countless other faces whose voices should not go unheard. 71. We would also like to take this opportunity to place on record data sourced from the National Judicial Data Grid (\"NJDG\") on the number of bail applications currently pending in High Courts and District Courts across India: j Pendency before the High Courts j j Bail applications j 91,56866 j i Criminal matters (writ petitions, case/petitions, appeals, i 12,66,133 1 j revisions and applications) j 1 : Pendency before the District Courts : s ..................................................................................................................................................................................... *·········································· A j Bail applications : 1,96,861 1 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................... , .......................................... .. 72. The data on NJDG is available in the public realm. NJDG is a valuable resource for all High Courts to monitor the pendency and disposal of cases, including criminal cases. For Chief Justices of the High Courts, the information which is available is capable of being utilised as a valuable instrument to promote access to justice, particularly in matters concerning liberty. The Chief Justices of every High Court should in their administrative capacities utilise the ICT tools which are placed at their disposal in ensuring that access to justice is democratized and equitably allocated.

Administrative Judges in charge of districts must also use the facility to engage with the district judiciary and monitor pendency. As the data on NJDG makes clear, there is a pressing need for courts across the judicial hierarchy in India to remedy the institutional problem of bail applications not being heard and disposed of with expedition . Every court in our country would do well to remember Lord Denning's powerful invocation in the first Hamlyn Lecture, titled \"Freedom under the Law\" 67 : \"Whenever one of the Judges takes seat, there is one application which by long tradition has priority over all others. The counsel has but to say, 'My Lord, I have an application which concerns the liberty of the subject', and forthwith the Judge will put all other matters aside and hear it .... \" It is our earnest hope that our courts will exhibit acute awareness to the need to expand the footprint of liberty and use our approach as a decision-making yardstick for future cases involving the grant of bail. 73. Since the proceedings are pending before the High Court , we clari fy that the observations on the facts contained in the presentjudgment are confined to a determination whether a case for grant of interim protection was made out. Equally, the observations which are contained in the impugned order4 of the High Court were also at the interim stage and will not affect the final resolution of the issues which arise and have been raised before the High Court. K. Conclusion 74. While reserving the judgment at the conclusion of arguments, this Court had directed the release of all the three appellants on bail pending the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court. The following operative directions were issued on 11-11-2020 60 : (Arnab Manoranjan Goswami case 60 , SCC p. 803, paras 6-8) \"6. We are of the considered view that the High Court 4 was in error in rejecting the applications for the grant of interim bail. We accordingly order and direct that Arnab Manoranjan Goswami, Feroz Mohammad Shaikh and Neetish Sarda shall be released on interim bail, subject to each of them executing a personal bond in the amount ofRs 50,000 to be executed before the Jail Superintendent. They are, however, directed to cooperate in the investigation and shall not make any attempt to interfere with the ongoing investigation or with the witnesses. 7. The jail authorities concerned and the Superintendent of Police, Raigad are directed to ensure that this order is complied with forthwith. 67 Sir Alfred Denning, \"Freedom under the Law\", the Hamlyn Lectures, First Series, available at <https://socialsciences .exeter .a c.uk/media/univer sityofexeter/school ofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/Freedom_ U nder_the_Law _ l . pdf>. 4 Arnab Manoran j an Goswami v.
