On the question whether the transactions amount to sales under the respective Sales Tax Acts, Held : Per curiam Sale-; by the allottees of cemt-nt to the licence holders in the State of West Bengal and the transactions between the growers and procuring agents as also those between the rice millers on the one hand and the wholesalers or retailers on the other in. the State of Andhra Pradesh are sales exigible to sales tax in the re:.pective States. Per Beg, C.J. It is not really the nomenclature involved but the substance of the tran- saction under consideration which matters in such cases. It is true that a considerable part of the field, over which what are- called 'sales' took place under either regulatory orders or levy orders passed or directions given under statutory provisions, is restricted and controlled by such orders and direc- tions. Deprivation of property for compensation which may even be described as \"price\" does not amount to sale when all that is done is to carry out an order so that the transaction i'> substantially a compulsory acquisition . On the other hand, a mere regulatory law even if it circumscribes the area of free choice does not take away the basic character or the core of saie from the transaction. Such a law which governs a class, may oblige selle,s to deal only with parties holding licences who may buy particular or allotted quantities of good~ at specified prices but an esse.1tial element of choice is still left to the parties between whom agreements took place. The agreement despite con- sideiable compulsive element 1egulating or restricting the area of free choice may still retain the basic character of a transaction of sale. In the former type of case the binding character of the transaction arises from the order directed to particular partie!. asking them to deliver specified goods and not from a general order or law applicable to a class. Jn the latter type of cases the legal tJ.e, vinculum Juris, which binds tho parties to p~rform their obliga- tions remains contractual. The regulatory la\\v merely adds other obliga- tions <;uch as the one to enter into such a tie between the parties indicated there. Although the regulatory law might specify the terms such as price or parties the regulation is subsidiary to the essential character of the transaction which I'- consensual and contractual. ·rhe basis of a contract i!. \"consenms ad idun\". The parties to the contract must agree upon the same thing in the same sen'-C Agreement on mutuality of consideration ordinarily arising from an offer and acceptance im~arts to it enforceability in courts of law. Mere regulation or restriction of the field of choice does not take away this con- t1actual or essentially consensual binding core ur character of the tran- saction. (Paras 48 to 52) C. S. T.v.

(I) When essential goods are in short supply various types of orders are issued. under the Essential Commodites Act, 1955, with a view to making the goods available to the consumer at a fair price. Such orders sometimes pro- vide that a person in need of an essential commodity like cement, cotton, coal or iron and steel must apply to the prescribed authority for a permit for obtain- ing the commodity. Those wanting to engage in the business of supplying the commodity are also required to possess a dealer's licence. A permit holdt:r can obtain the supply of goods to the extent of the quantity specified in the permit from the named dealer only and at a controlled price. The dealer who is asked to :.upply the stated quantity to the permit holder has no option but to supply the stated quantity of goods at the controlled price. (Para 1) (2) The view expressed in Gannon Dunkerley's case 1959 SCR 379 that the words ''sale of goods\" in Entry 48, List II of the Government of India Act, 1935, must be interpreted in the sense which they bear in the Sale of Goods Act, 1935 and that the meaning of those words should not be left to fluctuate with the definition of \"sale\" in laws relating to sales of goods which might be in fon.:e for the time being, may require reconsideration. But assuming that a sale 1s necessarily a consensual transaction and if the parties have no voht1on or option to bargain it could not be a sale, the transactions which are the ~ubject-matter of these appeals will amount to salas. The limitations imposed by the control orders on the normal right of delllers and consumers to supply and obtain the goods, the obligations imposed on the parties and the penalties prescribed do not militate against the position that eventually the parties must be deemed to have completed the transactions under an agree- ment by which one party has bound itself to supply the stated quantity of goods to the other at a price not higher than the notified price and the other consented to accept the goods on the terms and conditions mentioned in the permit or the order of allotment issued in its favour by the concerned autho- rity. Offer and acceptance need not always be in an elementary form nor indeed doe:. the law of contract or the sale of goods require that consent to a contract must be express. It is commonplace that offer and acceptance could be spelt out from the conduct of the parties which covers not only their acts, but omissions as well. Law does not require offer and acceptance to conform to any set pattern or formula. In urder, therefore, to determine whether the1e is any agreement or consensuality between the parties regard must be had to their conduct at or about the time when the goods changed hands. In the first place, 1t is not obligatory for a trader to deal in essential commodities nor on any one to acquire it. The primary fact therefore is that tlic decision or the trader to deal in an essential commodity is volitional. Such volition carries with it the willingness to trade in the commodity strictly on the terms of the control orders. The consumer too who is under no legal compulsion to acquire or posses~ the controlled commodity decides, as a matter of his volition. to obtam it on the te1ms of the permit or the order of alloi.ment issued m his favour. That brings the two parties together - one who is willing to :.upply the essential commodity and the other to receive. When the allottee prc..,ents his permit to the dealer, he signifies his willingness to obtain the com- modity from the dealer on the terms stated in the permit. His conduct reflects his consent and when upon the presentation of the permit the dealer acts upon 1t he impltedly agrees to supply the commodity to the allottee on the terms by which he has voluntarily bound himself to trade in the commodity. His conduct too reflects his consent. Thus, though both the parties are bound to comply with the legal requirements governing the transaction they agree, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It is, therefore, not correct to say that the transactions between the appellant and the allottees are not consensual. They, with their free consent, agreed to enter into the transac- tions. Though the terms of the transaction are mostly predetermined by law, it cannot be said there is no area at all in which there is no scope for the parties to bargain. The dealer can sell at a lower price, the customer can reject the goods on quality or short weight. So long as mutual assent, express or implied, is not totally excluded, the transaction will amount to sale. (Paras 21 to 25 & 36) (3) Cases of compulsory acquisition by the State stand on a different footing since there is in such cases no question of offer and acceptance nor of consent, either express or implied. (Paras 32, 35 & 43) (4) With the high ideals in the Preamble. and the Directive Principles of our Constitution there has to be a fundamental change in judicial outlook. Freedom of contract has largely become an illusion. The policy of our Parlia- ment in regard to contracts including those involving any sale of goods has still to reflect recognition of the necessity for a change which could be done by a suitable amendment of the definition of 'sale' of goods. The Gannon Dunkerley case, 1959 SCR 379 was influenced largely by the definition of sale in Benjamin's law relating to Sale. It involved an altogether different point and is not an authority for the proposition that there cannot be at all a contract of sale if the parties to a transaction a{e obliged to comply with the terms vf a statute.

Tht Judgments of the Court were delivered by CHANDRACHUD, J. (for himself, Bhagwati, Krishna Iyer, Untwalia, Fazal Ali and Kailasam, JJ.)-These appeals have been placed for hearing before a seven-Judgt. Bench in order to set at rest to the extent foreseeable, the con- troversy whether what is conveniently, though somewhat loosely, called a 'compulsory sale' is exigible to sales tax. When essential goods are in short supply, various types of orders are issued under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 with a view to making the goods available to the consumer at a fair price. Such orders sometimes provide that a person in need of an essential commodity like cement, cotton, coal or iron and steel must apply to the pres- cribed authority for a permit for obtaining the commodity. Those wanting to engage in the business of supplying the commodity are also required to possess a dealer's licence. The permit-holder can obtain the supply of goods, to the extent of the quantity specified in the permit, from the named dealer only and at a controlled price. The dealer who is asked to supply the stated quantity to the particular permit holder has no option but to supply the stated quantity of goods at the controlled price. The question for our consideration, not easy to decide, is whether such a transaction amounts to a sale in the language of the law. 2. We will refer to the facts of civil appeal 724 of 1976, in which a com- pany called M/s. Vishnu Agencies (Pvt.) Ltd., is the appellant. It carries on business as an agent and distributo1 of cement in the State of West Bengal and is a registered dealer under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, referred to hereinafter as the Bengal Sales Tax Act. Cement being a controlled com- modity, its distribution is regulated by the West Bengal Cement Control Act, 26 of 1948, refened to hereinafter as the Cement Control Act, and by the orders made under Section 3(2} of that Act. Section 3(1) of the Cement Control Act provides, inte1 alia, for regulation of production, supply and distribution of cement for ensuring equitable supply and distribution thereof at a fair price. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The appellant is a licensed stockist of cement and is permitted to stock cement in its godown, to be supplied to persons in whose favour allot- ment orders are issued, at the price stipulated and in accordancr with the condi- tions of permit issued by the authorities concerned. The authorities designated under the Cement Control Order issue r,ermits underwhich a spcc-ified quantity of cement is allotted to a named permit-holder, to be delivered by a n4med dealer at the price mentioned in the permit. A permit is generally valid fo1 15 days and as soon as the price of cement allotted in favour of an allottee is deposited with the dealer, he is bound to deliver to the former the specified quantity of cement at the specified price. 4. A specimen order issued in favour of an allottee, under which the appelJant had to supply 10 metric tons of cement at Rs. 144·58 per m.t., ex- clu'iive of sales tax, reads thus : LICENCE FOR CEMENT The quantities of cement detailed below are hereby allotted to M/s.

The appellant further contended that if the transactions were treated as sales, the definition of \"sale\" in the Sales Tax Act was ultra vires the legislative com- petency of the Provincial Legislature under the Government of India Act, 1935 and of the State Legislature under the Constitution. The appellate authority rejected the first contention and upheld the assessments. It did not, as it could not, go into the second contention regardinglegislative competence. The appellant adopted the statutory remedies open to it but since the arrears of tax were mounting up and had already exceeded a sum of rupees eight lacs, it filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court praying that the various assessment orders referred to in the etition be quashed and a writ of prohi- bition be issued directing the sales tax authorities to refrain from making any further assessments for the purpose of sales tax on the transactions between the ap. ellant and the allottees. 6. A learned single Judge of the High Court allowed the writ petition and issued a writ of mandamus restraining the respondents from imposing sales tax on the transactions between the appellant and the allottees. That judgment having been set aside in appeal by a Division Bench of the High Court by its judgment dated December 13, 1974, the appellant has filed appeal 724 of 1976 by special leave. 7. Civil Appeals 2488 to 2497 of 1972 raise a similar question under the Andhra Pradesh Paddy Procurement (Levy) Orders, under which paddy growers in the State are under an obligation to sell the paddy to licensed agents appointed by the State Government 1t the prices fixed by it. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh by its judgment dated March 31, 1970 has taken the same view as the Calcutta High Court, namely, that the transactions amount to sales and are taxable under the Sales Tax Act. Counsels appearing in the Andhra Pradesh appeal5. agree that the decision in the Calcutta case will govern those appeals also. 8. Since the crux of the appellant's contention is that the measures adopted to control the supply of cement leave no consensual option to the parties to bargain, it is necessary first to notice the relevant provi,;ions of law bearing on the matter . The We!'>t Bengal Cement Control Act, 26 of 1948, was enacted in order h' \"confer powers to control the productioo, supply and distribution of, and trade and commerce in, cement in West Bengal\".

Act, 1957. By virtue of the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Paddy Procurement (L~vy) Orders, the paddy-growers can sell their paddy to licensed procuring agents appointed by the State Government only and at the prices fixed by the Government. The agriculturist has the choice tQ select his own procuring agent but he cannot sell paddy to a private pur- chaser. The procuring agents in their turn have to supply paddy to the rice- millers at controlled prices. The millers, after converdng paddy into rice, have to declare their stocks to the Civil Supplies Department. Pursuant to the orders issued by the Department, the rice-millers have to supply a requisite quantity of rice to the wholesale or retail dealers at prices fixed by the Derart- ment. Orders for ~uch supply by the millers are passed by the authorities under the ,\\. P. Procurement (Levy) and Restriction on Sale Order, 1957. Under this order, every miller carrying on rice-milling operations is required to sell to the agent or officer duly authorised by the Government the minimum quanti!ies fixed by the Gove1 nment at the notified price ; and no miller or other perso11 who gets his paddy milled in ?.ny rice-mill can move or otherwisr dis- pose of the rice recovered by milling at such rice-mill except in accordance with the directions of the Collector. A breach of these provisions is liable to be punished under Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and the goods are liable to be forfeited under Section 6A of that Act. The A. P. sales tax authorities levied purchase tax on the purchase of paddy by the pro- curing agents from the agriculturists and they levied sales tax on the tran- sactions relating to the supply of rice by the millers to the wholesale and retail dealers and on the sales made by the retai1ers to their customers. The case as regards th~ 'iales tax imposed on the tran<sactions brtween the retail dealers an,l the consumers stood on an altogether different footing, but the, writ peti- tic.1s filed by the procuring agents and rice-millers raised questions similar to tho'ie involved in the writ petition filed in the Calcutta High Court. 12. These then are the provisions of the respectiw orders passed by the Governments of West Bengal and Andh1a Pradesh. 0. We may now notice the provisions of the Sales Tax Act'i. Section 2( !!') of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 6 of 1941, defines ~ \"sale\" to mean \"any transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valu- able consideration, including a transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a contract, but does not include a mortgage, hyp::>thecation. charge or pledge\".

TAX OFFICER (Chandrachud, J.) 529 liable to pay tax under the Act on all \"sales\" effected after the date notified by the State Government. 14. Section 2(n) of the Andhra Pradesh Central Sales Tax Act, 1957 defines a \"l>ale\" as \"every transfer of the property in goods by one person to another in the course of trade or commerce, for cash, or for deferred payment or for any other \\·aluablc consideration . \" Section 5 of that Act is the charging section. 15. According to these definitions of 'sale' in the West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh Sales Tax Acts, transactions between the appellants on one hand and the allottees or nonunees on the other are patently sales because indisputably, in one case the property in cement and in the other, property in paddy and rice wa'i transferred for cash consideration by the appellants ; and in so far a'i the West Bengal ca!>e is concerned, property in the goods did not pass to the tran ·fr'rees by way of mortgage, hypothecation, charge or pledge. But that is over-:-.implification. To counteract what appears on the surface plain enough, learned Counsel for the appellants have advanced a twofold contention. They contend, in the first place, that the word 'sale' in the Sales Tax Acts passed by the P:·ovincial or State Legislatures must receive the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 ; or else, the definition of 'sale' in these Sales Tax Acts will be beyond the legislative competence of the Provincial and State Legislatures. Secondly, the appelJants contend that since under the Sale of Goods Act, there can be no sale without a contract of sale and since the parties in these matters had no volition of their own but were compelled by law to supply and receive the goods at prices fixed under the Control Orders by the prescribed authorities, the transactions between them are not sail's properly so called and therefore are not exigible to sales tax. 16. For examinin~ the validity of the first contention, it is necessary to turn to the appropriate entries in the legislative lists of the CoMtitution Acts, for the contention is founded on the premise that the word 'sale' which occurs in those entries must receive the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 since the expression \"sale of goods\" was, at the time when thf\" Govern- ment of India Act was enacted, a term of well-recognised legal import in the general law relating to sale of goods and in the legislative practice rel:!ting to that topic both in England and in India. Entry 48 in the Provincial List, List TT of ScheJule VII to the Government of India Act, 1935 relates to : \"Taxes on the sale of goods\" . Entry 54 of List II, of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution reads to say : \"Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers, <:ubject to the provic;ions of Entry 92A of List I\". We are not concerned with Entry 92A of the Union List but we may refer to it in order to complete the picture. It refers to : \"Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers, where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce\".

The contention of the appellants that the expression \"sale of goods\" in Entry 48 in the Provincial List of the Act of 1935 and in Entry 54 in the State List of the Constitution must receive the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act is repelled on behalf of the State Governments with the argument that constitutional rrovisions which confer legislative powers must receiye a broad and liberal construction and therefore the expression \"sale of goods\" in Entry 48 and its successor, Entry 54, should not be construed in the narrow sense in which that expression is us-:!d in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 but in a broad sense. The principle that in interpreting a constituent or organic statute, that construction most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its powers must be adopted has been examined over the years by various Courts, including this Court, and is too firmly established to merit reconsi- deration. Some of the leading cases on this point are the Privy Council decisions in British Coal Corporation v. King1 , Edwards v. A. G. for Canada3 and James v. Commonwealth of Australict1 ; the Australian decisions in Morgan v. Deputy Federal Commissioner of Land Tax, N. S. W. 6 and Broken Hill South Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxation (N. S. W.) 6 ; the Federal Court decisions in In re the Central Provinces and Berar Act No XIV of 19387 and United Provinces v. Atiqa Begum8 ; and the decisions of this Court in Navin- chandra Mafatlal v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City9 and The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd. 10 These deci- sions have taken the view that a Constitution must not be construed in a narrow a11d pedantic sense, that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret it, that a Constitution of a Government is a living and orga11ic thing which of all instruments has the greatest claim to be cons- trued ut res magis valeat quam pereat, that the Legislature in selecting subjects of taxation is entitled to take things as it finds them in rerum natura and-that it is not proper that a court should deny to such a Legislature the right of solving taxation problems unfettered by a priori legal categories which often derive from the exercise of legislative power in the same constitutional unit. 18. Ora a careful examination of various decisions bearing on the point this Court speaking through Venkatarama Aiyer, J. in Gannon Dunkerley (supra) upheld the contention of the State of Madras that the words \"sale of goods\" in Ent1 1 48 which occur in the Constitution Act and confer legis- lative powe1,; on the State Legislature in respect of a topic relating to taxation must be interpreted not in a restricted but broad sense. But as observed by the learned Judge in that case, this conclusion opens up questions as to wha, that sense is, whether popular or lega1, and what its connotation is, either in the one sense or the other.

Ltd. ~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf VISHNU AGENCIES (PVT.) LTD. v. COMRL. TAX OFFICER (Chandrachud, J.) 531 of Goods Act, Corpus Juris, Williston on Sales and the Concise Oxford Dictionary, the Court held that the expression \"sale of goods\" in Entry 48 cannot be construed in its popular sense and that it must be interpreted in its legal sense. Whereas in popula1 parlance a sale is said to take place when the bargain is settled between the parties though property in the goods may not pass at that stage, as where the contract relates to future or unasc-ertained goods, the essence of 'sale' in the legal sense is the transfer of the property in a thing from one 1-e1son to another for a price. 19. The Court then proceeded to determine the connotation of the ex- pression \"sale of good!>\" in the legal sense and held, having · regard to the evolution of the law relating to sale of goods, the scheme of the Indian Contract Act and the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, which repealed Chap- ter VII of the Indian Contract Act relating to sale of goods, that according to the law both o f England and of India, in order to constitute a sale it is neces- sary that there '>hould be an a(?reement between the parties for the purpose of transferring title to the goods, which presupposes capacity to contract, that the contract must be supported by valuable consideration and that as a result of the transaction property must actually pass in the goods. \"Unless all these elements are p-esent, there can be no sale.\" 20. Basing itself on this position, the Court finally concluded in Gannon Dunkerley (supra) that the expression \"sale of goods\" was, at the time when the Government of India Act was enacted, a term of well-recognised legal import in the general law relating to sale of goods and in the legislative practice relating to that topic both in England and in India and therefore that expres- sion, occurrin~ in Entry 48, mu,;t be interpreted in the sense which it bears in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. In coming to this conclusion, the Court relied upon the American decisions in United Statesv. Wong Kim Arku, South Ci.1rolina v. United State'i 12 and Ex Parte Grossman19, the Privy Council decisions in L'Union St. Jacques De Montreal v. Be Lisleu, Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue16 , The Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Tron Works Ltd. 16, Croft v. Dunphy17 and Wallace Brothers & Co. Ltd. v.

The view expressed in Gannon Dunkerley (supra) that the words \"sale of goods\" in Entry 48 must be interpreted in the sense which they bear in the Sale of Goods Act, I 930 and that the meaning of those words should not be left to flu.;tuate with the definition of 'sale' in laws relating to sales of goods which might be in force for the time being may, with respect, bear further consideration but that may have to await a mart\" suitable occasion It will then be necessary to examine whether the words \"sale of goods\" which occur in Entry 48 should not be construed so as to extend the competence of the Legislature to enacting laws in respect of matters which might be unknown in 1935 when the Government of India Act wa<; passed but which may have come into existence later, as a result of a social and economic evolution. In Attorney Generol v. Edison Telephone Company of London21 a question arose whether the Edison Telephone Company, London, infringed by installation of telephones, the exclusive privilege of trammitting telegrams which was conferred upon the Postmaster-G :>neral under an Ac-t of I 869. The deci- sion depended on the meaning of the word \"telegraph\" in the Acts of 1863 and 1869. The company contended that since telephones were unknown at the time when those Acts were passed, the definition of 'telegraph' could not corn prehend 'telephones'. That contention was negatived by an English Court. In the Ref.fulation and Control of Radio Communication in Canada, In re22 a similar question arose as to whether \"broadcasting\" was covered by the ex- pression \"telegraph and other wo1ks and undertaking,;\" in Section 92(10)(a) of the Constitution Act of 1867. The Privy Council amwered the question in the affirmative and was apparently not imp1 essed by the contention that broadca,;ting was not known as a means of communication at the time when the Constitution Act was passed. These decisions proceed on the principle that i r after the enactment of a legislation, new facts an.-'1 situations arise which could not have been in the contemplation of the Legislature, ~tatutory provi- sions can justifiably be applied to those facts and situations so long as the 21. 1880 LR 6 QBD 244 22. 1932 AC 304 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

This principle, according to the view expressed in Gannon Dunkerley (supra), did not apply to the interpretation of Entry 48, a view which in our opinion is capable of further scrutiny. It is, however, unnecessary in these appeals to investigate the matter any further because, the position which emerges after putting on the wo1ds of Entry 48 the same meaning which those words bear in the Sate of Goods Act, 1930 is that in order to constitute a sale, it is necessary that there should be an agreement between the parties. In other words, the effo.:t of the consn·uction which the Court put on the words of Entry 48 in Gannon Dunkerley (~upra) is that a sale is necessarily a consensual transaction and 1f the pa. ties have no volition or option to bargain, there can be no sale. For the pre3ent purposes, this view may be assumed to reflect the correct legal position but even so, the transactions which are the subject-matter of these appeals wiJI amount to sales. 22. Applying the ratio of Gannon Dunkerley (supra), the true question for dei.:ii,ion, therefore, is whether in t ,1e context of the Control Orde1s issued by the Government of West Bengal for regulatmg the supply and distribution of cement, the transactions under which the appellant supplied cement to persons who were issued penmts by the authorities to obtain the commodity from the appellant, involved an element of volition or consensualily. If they did the transactions would amount to sales, but not otherwise. It is undeni- able that under paragraph 2 of the West Bengal Order of 1948, which w~ have fo1 convenience designated as the Cement Control Order, no person can dis- pose of or agree to dispose of any cement except m ac.;ordance with the condi- tions contained in a written order of the Director of Consumer Goods or the authorities specified in that paragraph. That is a limitation on the dealer's right to supply cement. Correspondingly by paragraph 3, no person can acquire or agree to acquirn cement from any person except in accordance with the conditions i.:ontained in a written order of the Director of Consumer Goods or the authorities specified in that paragraph. That. is a Limitation on the consumer's I ight to obtain cement. Paragraph 4 puts a restriction on the price which a dealer may charge for the commodity by providing that no pet son shall sell cement at a price higher than the notified price. Paragraph 8 imposes on the dealer the obligation to supply cement by providing tlJat no person or stockist who has any stock of cement in his possession and to whom a written order has been is::.ued under paragraph 2 shall refuse to sell the same at a price not exceeding the notified price. A person who contravenes the provisions of the Cement Control Order is punishable under Section 6 of the West Bengal Cement Co11tr0L Act, 1948 with imprisonrncnt for a tt:rm which may extend to three years or with fine or with both . 23. l hes0 limitations on the normal I ight o[ dealers and consumers to ~upply and obtain the goods, the obligations imr,,)sed on the parties and the penalties prc~cribed by the Control Order do not, in our opinion, militate again<;t the position that eventually, the parties must be deemed to have com- pleted the transaction'> under an agreement by which one party bound itself ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Offer and acceptance need not always be in an elementary form, nor indeed does the Law of Contract or of Sale of Goods require that consent to a contract must be express. It is com- monplace that offer and acceptance can be spelt out from the conduct of the parties which covers not only their acts but omissions as well. Indeed, on occasions, silence can be more eloquent than eloquence itself. Just a& correspondence between the parties can constitute or disclose an offer and acceptance, so can their conduct. This is because, law does not require offer and acceptance to conform to any set pattern or formula. 24. ln order, therefore, to dete1mine whether there was any agreement or consensuality between the r,arties, we must have regard to their conduct at or about the time when the goods ch.:..nged hands. In the first place, it is not obligatory on a trader to deal in cement nor on any one to acquire it. The primary fact, therefore, is that the decision of the trader to deal in an essential commodity 1s volitional. Such volition carries with it 'the willingness to trade in the commodity strictly on the terms of Control Orders. The consumer too, who 1s under no legal compulsion to acquire or possess cement, decides as a matter of his volition to obtain it on the terms of the permit or the order of allotment issued in his favour. That brings the two parties together, one of whom is willing to supply the essential commodity and the other to receive it. When the allottee presents his permit to the dealer, he signifies his willing- ness to obtam the commodity from the dealer on the terms stated in the permit. His conduct reflects his consent. And when, upon the presentation of the permit, the dealer acts upon it, he impliedly agrees to supply the commodity to the allottee on the terms by which he has voluntarily bound himself to trade in the commodity. His conduct too reflects his consent. Thus, though both parties are bound to comply with the legal requirements governing the tran- saction, they agree as between themselves to enter into the transaction on statutory terms, one agreeing to supply the commodity to the other on those te1 ms and the other agreeing to accept it from him on the very terms. It is therefore not correct to say that the transactions between the apr,ellant and the allottees are not consensual. They, with their free consent, agreed to enter into the tlansactions. 25. We are also of the opinion that though the terms of the transaction are mostly predete1mined by law, it cannot be said that there is no area at all in which there is no scope fo1 the parties to bargain. The West Bengal Cement Control Act, 1948 empowers the Government by Section 3 to regulate or control the prices at which cement may be purchased or sold. The Cement Control Order, l 948 provides by paragraph 4 that no person ~hall sell cement at a \"higher than notified price\", leaving it open to the parties to charge and pay a price which is less than the notified price, the notified prict being the maxi- mum price which may lawfully be charged.

TAX OPPICER (Chandrachwl, J.) 535 in the same direction by providing that no dealer who has a stock of cement in his possession shall refuse to sell the same \"at a price not exceeding the notified price\", leaving it open to him to charge a lesser price, which the allottee would be only too agreeable to pay. Paragraph 8 further provides that the dealer shall deliver the cement \"within a reasonable time\" after the payment of price. Evidently, within the bounds of reasonableness, it would be open to the parties to fix the time of delivery. Paragraph 8A which confers on the allottee the right lo ask for weighment of goods also shows that he may reject the goods on the ground that they are short in weight just as indeed, he would have the undoubted right to reject them on the ground that they are not of the requisite quality. The circumst,&nce that in these areas, though minimal, the parties to the transactions have the freedom to bargain militates against the view that the transactions are not consensual. 26. While on this aspect, we may usefully draw attention to two im- portant decisions of this Court, the. first of which is Indian Steel & Wire Products Ltd. v. State of Madras 23 • The appellant therein supplied certain steel pro- ducts to various per .. ons in Madras at the instance of the Steel Controller exerch,ing power.i under the Iron and Steel (Control of Production and Distri- bution) Order, 1941. The State of Madras assessed the turnover of the appel- lant to sale; tax upon which, the appellant contended that the deliveries of steel products were made unde1 compulsion of law since it was the controller who determined the persons to whom the goods were to be supplied, the price at which they were to be supplied, the- manner in which they were to be trans- ported and th~ mode in which the payment of the price was to be made. Since every facet of the transaction was prescribed by the controller, so it was argued, there was no agreement between the parties and therefore the transaction could not be considered as a sale. Rejecting this contention, it was observed by Hegde, J., who spoke for the Constitution Bench, that though the controller fixed the base price of the steel products and dete1mined the buyers, the parties were still free to decide the other terms of the bargain, as for example, the time and date of delivery and the time apd mode of payment and therefore it could not be said that there was no agreement between th~. parties to sell and buy the goods. It was held that though the area within which it was possible for the parties to bargain was greatly relieved on account of the Iron and Steel Control Order, it was not correct to contend that because law im- poses restrictions on freedom of contract, there could be. no contract at all. \"So long as mutual assent is not completely excluded in any dealing, in law it is a contract.\" 27.

Under Section 21 of that Act, sales and purchase of sugarcane were exempt from tax under the Andhra Pradesh Gene1 al Sales Tax Act, 1957, but under Section 2(1) of the Act of 1961, the State Government had power by notification to levy a tax \"on the purchase of cane required for use, consumption or sale in a sugar factory\". Various sugar factories in the State filed writ petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the validity of Section 21 mainly on the ground that since they were compelled by law to buy cane from the cane-growers, their purchases were not made under agreements and were not taxable under Entry 54, List II of the Seventh Sche- dule to the Constitution having regard to the decision in Gannon Dunkerley (supra). The writ petitions were decided b> a Constitution Ben.::h of thi.:. Com t which delivered its unanimous judgment through Bachawat, J. It is necessary in the first place to state that though it was argued on behalf of the State Government in that case that the occupier of the factory had some option of not buying the sugarcane from the grower and had some freedom of bar- gaining about the terms and conditions of the agreement, that point was no\\. pursued any further and the writ petitions proce..!ded on the bal,is that there wai. no option left for any bargain in th..: transaction. After referring to the defi- nitio1; of \"contract of sale of goods\" in Section 4( l) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930, and the relevant provision-; of the Contract Act relating to offer and acceptance, the Court observed that under Section 10 of the Contract Act, ali agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of the part1e~ competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and witil a JawfoJl object, and are not by the Act expresl>ly declared to be void. Section 13 of the Con- tract Act define~ \"consent\" and Section 14 says that consent is said to be free when it is not c,rnsed by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake as defined in Sections 15 to 22. In the background of these provi- sions, the Court observed that the cane-grower in the factory 70ne was free to make or not to make an offer of sale of cane to the occupier of the factory. But if he made an offer, the occupier 9f the factory was bound to accept 1t and the consent of the occupier nol being caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake was \"free consent\" as defiaed in Section 14 of the Contrdct Act, even though he was obliged by law to enter into the agreement. \"l'he compulsion of law is not coercion a s defined in Section 1.5 of the Act\" and •·m the eye of the law, the agreement is freely 1nade\". Since the parties were competent to contract, the agreement wal> made for a ]awful com,ideration and with a lawful objt:ct, the agreement was not void under any provision of law and it was enforceable at law, the Court held that the purchases of sugarcane were taxable by the State Legi~laturc under Entry 54, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. 28.

TAX OFFICER (Chandrachud, J.) 537 Controller of J ndia, from time to time, their requirements of sugar and simi- larly, the factory owners used to sond to the Sugar Controller of India state- menb of stocks of sugar held by them. On a consideration of the requests received from the State Governments and the statements of stock received from the factories, the- Sugar Controller used to make allotment of sugar. The allotment orde1 was addressed by the Sugar Controller to the factory owner directing him to supply sugar lo the State Government in question in accord- ance with the despatch instructions received from the competent officer of the State Government. A copy of the allotment order was simultaneously sent lo the State Government concerned, on receipt of which the competent autho- rity of the State Government sent to the factory concerned detailed instruc- tions about the destinations to which the sugar was to be despatched as also the quantities of sugar to be despatched to each place. The Madras Govern- ment which, undt>r this arrangement, received its quota of sugar from the New India Sugar Mills, aho Jaid down the procedure of payment. The Patna High Court having held that the supply of sugar by the mills to the Province of Madra<; was liable to be taxed under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, the milb filed an appeal to this Court which was decided by a Bench of three learned Judges. Kapur and Shah, JJ. held that since the mills were compelled to carry out the directions of the Controller and since they had no volition in the matter of supply of ~ugar to the State of Madras, there wa'i no offer by them lo the Slate Government and no acceptance by the latte1. Shah J., speak- mg for the majo1 ity observed that a contract of sale between the seller and th-: buyer 1s a prerequisite to a sale and since there was no such contract, the transaction m question which the Bihar Sales Tax authorities sought to tax was not ex1g1blc to sales tax. 29. Hidayatullah, J. who delivered a dis~enting opinion observed after reviewing the position both under the English and the Indian Law, that though it was true that consent makes a contract of sale, such consent \"may be ex- prc~s or implied and It cannot be said that unless the offer and acceptance are there in an elementary form, there can be no taxable saie\". Taking the view that on obtaining the necessary penn1t, the sugar mills on the one hand and the Govcrnm~nt of Madras on the vther agreed to \"sell\" and \"purcha,,e\" sugar could ,tdmit of no doubt, the learned Judge said that when the Province of Madra.:1 ..ifter 1eceiving the permit, telegraphed instructions to despatch ~ugar and the milb despatched it, \"a contract emerged and consent must be implied 011 both <;idc~ though not expressed antecedently to the pe1 n1it\". The Con- troller brought the seller and the purchaser together, gave them pe1mi~sion to supply and receive sugar leading thereby to an implied contract of ~ale between the partie-;. The learned Judge accepted tha_t there was an element of com- pulsion in both sc-lling and buying, perhaps more for thG supplier than for the receiver. but. according to him, \"a compelled sale is neverthele~~ a sale\" and \"1,alcs often tal<c place without volition of a party\".

The present is just another example of an iIJJPlied con- tract with an implied offer and im1,lied acceptance by the parties..... Advert- ing to the construction of the legislative Entry 48 of List II, Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, the learned Judge observed that the entry had to be interpreted in a liberal spirit and not cut down by narrow technical considerations. \"The entry in other words should not be shorn of all its content to leave a mere husk of legislative power. For the purposes of legislation such as on sales tax it is only necessary to see whether there is a sale, express or implied. . . . The entry has its meaning and within its meaning there is a plenary power. If a sale express or implied is found to exist theo the tax must follow.\" 30. We are of the opinion that the true position in law 1s as is set out in the dissenting judgment of Hidayatullah, J. and that, the view expressed by Kapur and Shah, JJ. in the majority judgment, with deference, cannot be considered as good law. Bachawat, J. in Andhr.i Sugars (supra) was, with respect, right in cautioning that the majority judgment of Kapur and Shah, JJ. in New India Sugar Mills (sui;ra) \"should not be treated as an authority for the proposition that there can be no contract of sale under compulsion of a statute\", (pages 715-716). Rather than saying what, in view of the giowing uncertainty of the true legal position on the question, we are constrained to say, namely, that the majority judgment in New India Sugar Mills (supra) is not good law, Bachawat, J. preferred to adopt the not unfamiliar manner of confining the majority decision to \"the special facts of that case\". 31. The majority judgment in New India Sugar Mill-> (supra) is based predominantly on the decision of this Court in Gannon Dunkerley (supra) to which we have referred at· length in another context. In fact, Shah, J. observes at page 469 of the report after discussing the judgment in Gannon Dunkerley (supra) that \"the ratio decidendi of that decision must govern this case\". The decision in Gannon Dunkerley (supra) really turned on a different point, the question for consideration therein being whether the value of the materials used in the execution of building contracts could be included within the tax- able turnover of the company. It was contended on behalf of the company that the power of the Madras Legislature to impose a tax on sales under Entry 48, List 11 of Schedule VII of the Government of India Act, 1935 did not extend to imposing a tax on the value of materials used in construction works, as there was no transaction of sale in respect of those goods, and that the provisions introduced in the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, by the Madras General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1947, authorising the imposi- tion of such tax were ultra vires. Venkatarama Aiyer, J. posed the question thus : \"The sole question for determination in this appeal is whether the provi- sions of the Madras General Sales Tax Act are ultra vires, in so far as they seek to impose a tax on the supply of materials in execution of works contract treat- ing it as a sale of goods by the contractor ... \".

TAX OFFICBR (Chandrachud, J.) 539 building materials were 'goods' and limited the inquiry to whether there was \"a sale of those materials within th~ meaning of that word in Entry 48\". Reference was then made to Benjamin on Sale in which it is said that in order to constitute a 'sale', four elements must concur : \"(I) Parties competent to contract ; (2) mutual assent ; (3) a thing, the absolute or general p1operty in which is transferred from the seller to the buye1 ; and (4) a price in money paid or promised\". (Vide Eighth Edn., p. 2). On the strength of this state- ment and on a consideration of the provisions of the Contract Act and the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 it was concluded that \"acco1ding to the law both of England and of India, in order to constitute a sale it is necessary that there should be an agreement between the parties for the purpose of transferring title to goods\". The Court then proceeded to examine the true nature of a building contract and held : It has been already stated that, both under the common law and the statute law relating to sale of goods in England and in India, to consti- tute a transaction of sale there should be an agreement, express or im- plied, relating to goods to be completed by passing of title in those goods. It is of the essence of this concept that both the agreement and the sale should relate to the sime subject-matter. Whe1e the goods delivered under the contract are not the goods contracted for, the purchase1 has got a right to reject them, or to accept them and claim damages for breach of warranty. Under the law, therefore, there cannot be an agreement relating to vne kind of property and a sale as regards another. We are acco1 dingly of opinion that on the true interpretation of the expression ·.,ale of goods' there must be an agreement between the r arties for the sale of the very goods in which eventually property passes. In a build- ing contract, the agreement between the parties is that the contractor should construe,t a building according to the specifications contained in the agree- ment. and in consideration therefor receive payment as provided therein, and as will presently be shown there is in such an agreement neithe1 a contract to sell the materials used in the construction, nor does property pass therein as movables. 1t is therefore impossible to maintain that there is implicit in a building contract a sale of materials as understood in law. (pages 413-414). The final conclusion on the point involved in the app~al was expressed thus : To sum up, the expression 'sale of goods' in Entry 48 is a nomen juris, it-; e\"sential ingredients being an agreement to sell movabks for a price and property passing therein pursuant to that agreement. In a building contract which is, as in the present case, one, entire and indivisible- and that i-; its norm, there is no sale of goods, and it is not within the competence of the Provincial Legislature under Entry 48 to impose a tax on the supply of the materials used in such a contract treating it as a sale. (pages 425-426). Thus, the two ri.:asom given by the Court in support of its conclusion were-, firstly, that in a building contrac.t there was no agreement, express or implied, to sell 'goods' and secondly, that property in the building materials does not pa.-,s in the materials regarded as 'goods' but it passes as part of immovable pi operty. ln New India Sugar Mills (supra), the commodity with which the Court was concerned was sugar and was delivered as sugar just as in the instant ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

That meets the first reason in Gannon Dunkerley (supra). As regards the second, it is quite clear that the tax was demanded after the commodity had changed hands or putting it in the words of the Sale of Goods law, after property in it had passed. With great respect therefore, the majority in New India Sugar Mills (supra) was in error in saying that \"the ratio de(.,idendi of that decision (Gannon Dunkerley) must govern this case\". The question before us which was the very question involved in New India Sugar Mills (supra) viz., whether a transaction effected in accordance with the obligatory terms of a statute can amount to a 'sale' did not arise in Gannon Dunkerley (supra). 32. Just as the majority Judges in New India Sugar Mills (supra) applied to the case before them the ratio of GMnon Dunkerley (supra), the Court in the latter case applied the ratio of the House of Lords decision in Kirkness v. John Huason & Co. Ltd.26 observing categorically that \"the decision in Kirkness must be held to conclude the matter\" (p. 412). We think it necessary to lay particular emphasis on this aspect because it shows how the question for deci- sion in Gannon Dunkerley (supra) was basically different from the question in New India Sugar Mills (supra) or in the appeals before us. In Kirknt!ss, railway wagons belonging to the respondent company were taken over by the Transport Commission compulsorily in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 29 of the Transport Act, 1947, and compensation was paid therefor. The question was whethe1 this amount was liable to income-tax on the footing of sale of the wagons by the company. The contention on behalf of the Revenue was that compulsory acquisition being treated as s'lle under the English law, the taJ..ing over of the wagons and payment of compensation therefor must also be regarded as sale for purpose of income-tax and therefore, the company was liable to a balancing charge under Section 17 of the Income-tax Act, 1945. The case turned on the meaning of the word 'sale' for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax legislation and the Jncome-tax Act, 1945 (8 & 9 Geo. 6, c. 32). Lord Morton in his dissenting speech found it \"impossible to say that the only construdion which can fairly be given to the word 'sold' in Section l 7(l)(a) tif the Income Tax Act, 1945, is to limit it to a transaction in which the element of mutual assent is p,esent\". But the majority of the House came to a different conclusion, and held that the element of bargain was ess~at1al to constitute a sale , and to dlc'scnbe compulsory taking over of property as a sale wa~ a nmuse of that word. We are not concerned in these appeals with 'com- pulsory acquisition' of goods nor indeed, was the Court concerned with it m Gannon Du11kerley (::.upra). The majority in New India Sugar Mills (supra) \\\\as right in saying that the decision in Kirknes.<. and the \"observations made therein have little relevance in determining the limits of the legislative power of the Provincial Legislature under the Government of India Act, 1935, and the interpretation of statutes enacted in exercise of that power\".

Besides Kirkness has been re- ferred to in various decisions and has been considered as an authority for apparently conflicting: propositions, which too made it necessary to under- stand the decision in a p.r;oper perspective. 33. It is not the decision in Kirkness but another English decision which may with advantage be noticed. That is the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ridge Nominees Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners\". The question in that case was whether a transfer of shares executed under Section 209 of the Companies Act, 1948 on behalf of a stockholder who declined to accept the offer of purchase was required to be stamped as a transfer on sale. Under Section 209, the transferee company was entitled in certain circumstances to give a notice to a dissenting shareholder that it desired to acquire his shares. Upon such notice being given, the transferee company becam entitled to acquire. the shares of the dissenting shareholder at a particular price. If the disc;enting shareholder did not transfer the shares, then sub-section (3) pro· vidcd for the execution of a transfer on behalf of the shareholder by a person appl.linted by the transferee company. In the First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891 was included the item \"Conveyance or transfer on sale of any pro- pJrty ... \". In the light of this entry under which stamp duty was payable, the question which the Court had to consider was whether a transfer executed on behalf of a dissenting shareholder was a \"transfer on sale\". The answer deoe11ded upon whether there could be a sale even though the essential element of inutual assent was totally absent. Lord Evershed, M. R. observed in his judgment that what the Companies Act had done, by the machinery it had created, was that in truth it brought into being a transaction which ex facie in all its essential characteristics and effect was a transfer on sal ~. Donovan, L. J. in his concurring judgment said that when the Legislature by Section 209 of the Companies Act empowered the transferee company to appoint an agent on behalf of a dissenting shareholder for the purpose of executing a transfer of hi-; shares against a rrice to be paid to the transferor company and held in trust for the dissenting shareholder, it was clea1ly ignoring his dissent and putting him in the same position as if he had assented. For the purpose of considering whether the tranc;action amounted to a sale. one must, according to the learned Judge, regard the dissent of the shareholder as overriden by an assent which the statute imposed upon him, fictional though it may be. Danckwerts, L.J., also by a concurring judgment, said that a sale may not always re<1uire the consensual clement and that there may, in truth, be a corn* pulsory sate of property in which the owner is compelled to part with his pro- perty for a price, against his wilt. 34.

Ltd. 27 the respondent-assessee which was registered as a dealer unde1 the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954, entered into a contract with the Equitable Coal Company under which it acquired monopoly rights to supply coal in Rajasthan as an agent of the Coal Company. The respondent supplied coal to the State of Rajasthan under an agreement with it and that transac- tion was included in the respondent's turnover by the Sales Tax Officer, Jaipur. The High Court of Rajasthan allowed the respondent's writ petition against the order of assessment on the ground, inter alia, that the supply of coal by the respondent to the State of Rajasthan did not constitute sail as the supply was controlled by a statutory order, namely, the Colliery Control Order, 1945. In appeal to this Court by the State of Rajasthan, it was held that under the Colliery Control Order, coal could be supplied under a contract and the effect of the Control Order was only to superimpose upon the agreement between the parties the rate fixed by the Control Orde1. Tq.e four elements requi1 ed to constituLe a sale. namely, competency of parties, mutual assent of the parties, passing of property in the goods supplied to the purchaser, and lastly, pay- ment or promise of payment of price were all present to render the turnover liable to sates tax:. Shah, J. who spoke for the Court relied upon the judg- ments in Indian Steel and Wire Products (supra) and Andhra Sugars (supra) observing that in these two cases the Court had held that \"when goods, supply of which is controlled by statutory orders, are delivered pursuant to a contract of sale, the principle of the case in M/s. New India Sugar Mills Ltd. (sup1a) has no application\". The Court distinguished the decision in New India Sugar Mills (supra) on the ground that it was founded on a different principle since the condition requiring mutual assent of the parties was lacking in that case. 35. In Chhitter Mai Narain Das v.

In appeal to this Court it was held by a Bench consisting of Shah and Hegde, JJ. that Clause 3 of the U. P. Wheat Procurement (Levy) Order, t 959 sets up a machinery for compulsory acqui- sition by the State Government of stocks of wheat belonging to the licensed dealers, that the Order contains a bald injunction to supply wheat of the speci- fied quantity day after day, that it did not envisage any consensual arrange- ment and that the Order did not even require the State Government to enter into an informal contract with the supplier. Delivering the judgmen• of the Bench, Shah . .T. observed that the transaction in which an obligation to supoly gocds is imposed, and which does not involve an obligation to enter into a contract, cannot be called a 'sale', even if the person supplying goods is de- clared entitled to th~ value of goods which is determined in the prescribed 27.

It was observed that the decision in Indian Steel and Wire Products (supra) does not justify the view that even if the liberty of contract in relation to the fundamentals of the transaction is completely excluded, a transaction of supply of goods pursuant to directions issued under a Control Order may be regarded as a s.ale. This decision is clearly distinguishable since the provi- sions of the Wheat Procurement Order were construed by the Court as being in the natme of compulsory acquisition of property, obliging the dealer to supply wheat from day to day. Cases of compulsory acquisition of property by the State stand on a different footing since there is no question in such cases of offer and acceptance nor of consent, either express or implied. 36. We would, however, like to clarify that though compulsory acquisi- tion of pro~erty would exclude the element of mutual assent which is vital to a sale, the learned Judges were, with respect, not right in holding in Chhitter Mai that even if in respect of the place of delivery and the place of payment of price, there could be a consensual arrangemc nt, the tramaction will not amount to a sale (p. 677) (SCC p. 814). The true position in law is as stated above, namely, that so long as mutual assent, express or implied, is not totall,; excluded the transaction will amount to a sale. The ultimate decision in Cl1hitter Mai can be justified only on the view that Clause 3 of the Wheat Procurement Order envisages compulsory acquisition of wheat by the State Government from the licensed dealer. Viewed from this angle, w cannot endorse the Court's criticism of the Full Bench decision of the All habad High Court in Commissioner, Sales Tax, U. P. v. Ram Bi/as Ram Gopa/ 29 which held while construing Clause 3 that so long as there was freedom to bargain in some areas the transaction could amount to a sale though effected under com- pulsion of a statute. Looking at the scheme of the U. P. Wheat Procure- ment Order, particularly Clause 3 thereof, this Court in Chhitter Mai seems to have concluded that the transaction w11s, in truth and substance, in the nature of compulsory acquisition, with no real freedom to bargain in any area.

They challenged the levy on the ground that on account of the Central and State Control Orders applic,ble to the transactions, there was no mutual assent between them and the growers of sugarcanf: in regard to supply of sugarcane by the latter and since there was no purchase and sale of sugarcane, they were not dealers within the meaning of Section 2(k) of the Mysore Sales Tax Act. After refe1 ring to the cases which we have considered above, it was held by the Court that the decisions relating to 'compulsory sales' establish that statutory orders regulat- ing the supply and dist1 ibution of goods do not absolutely impinge on the 29.

In spite of the fact that under the relevant Control Orders the parties, the minimum price and the minimum quantity of supply were determined or regulated, the Court held that the Control Orders left to the parties the option in regard to a higher quantity than was stipulated in the Orders, a higher price than the minimum as also the form and manner of payment. A factor) could 1eject goods after inspection which indicated not only freedom in the formation but also in the performance of the contract. A combination of all these factors, according to Ray, J. who spoke for a un• animous Court, indicated with unerring accuracy that the parties entered into agreement with mutual assent and with volition fot transfer of goods in con- sideration of price. The transactions were accordingly held as amounting to sales within the meaning of Section 2(t) of the Mysore $ales Tax Act. In coming to this conclusion thf Court relied on the statement in Benjamin on Sah..a1 that though a contract of sale requires mutual assent, \"The assent need not as a general rule be express\" and that, it may be implied from the language or conduct of parties and indeed it may even be inferred from the silence on the part of parties in certain cases. As an instance, the Court referred to the common case of a person buying rationed article, from a ration shop. \"The parties, the price, the shop, the supply and the acceptance of goods in accord- ance with the provisions of the Ration Order are all regulated.\" All the same, said the Court, when the customer presents the ration card to the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper delivers the rationed articles, the customer accepts the articles and pays their price \"there is indisputably a sale\". 38. Jn State of Tamil Nadu v. Cement Distributors Private Ltd.32 the principal question which arose for decision was whether producers who sup- plied cement to the State Trading Corporation or its agent in gunny bags in pursuri nce of the directions given by the Government were liable to pay sale,; tax on the turnover relating to the price of gunny bags. In some of the con- nected appeals the que~tion also arose whether the selling agents of the State Trading Corporation were liable to pay sales tax in respect of the price of the gunny bags in which they sold cement to the consumers. As regards the question whether the transactions between producers and the State Trading Corpotation in so far a'> the ~upply of cement was concerned amounted to sal0,; within the meaning of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959, Hegde J. who spoke for the three-Judge Bench observed that there was \"no dispute\" that those transactions could not amount to sales in view of the Cement Control Order, 1958. On the question whether the gunny bags, in which the cement wa,; supplied, can be considered to have been sold it was observed that there wa,; \"no di,;pute\" that if the price of gunny bags was held to have been wholly controlled, th~n the supply of gunny bags also could not be considf'red as sales. Thi,; po<;ition was held to have been concluded by the decisions in New India Sugar Mill.~ Ltd. (supra) and Chliitter Mai Narain Dm (sui:ra).

On that question it was held that since the Central Government had fixed the actual price of tht gunny bags also, the supply of gunny bags did not 'lmount to sales. In the first place, the decision proceeds on a concession in so far as the supply of ct-ment is con_cemed as is shown by the statement that there was \"no dispute\" that \"the same cannot be considered as sales\". As regards the other question concerning gunny bags, the Court did not allow the A~vocate General of Tamil Nadu to contend that since, under Clause 6(4) of the Cement Cor. trol 01 der tht Central Government could have fixed the maximum and not the actual price of gunny bags, thert- was scope for bargaining betw_een the parties._ That question not having been raised in the High Court or in the appeal memo filed in this Court and the Central Government not having put in its appearance in this Court, permission was declined to raise the question. Thus the deci- sion is not an authority for the proposition for which the appellant contends. Besides, the judgmen~ rests partly on the decision in New India Sugar Mills (supra) which we have dissented from and partly on Chhitter Mai (supra) which, by reason of the 'compulsory acquisition' inferred therein, was distinguishable. 39. Jn Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. State of Bihar 33 a three-Judge Bench speaking through Ray, C.J. held, following the judgment in Safar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. (supra), that the supplies of crude oil by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission to a refinery of tht- Indian Oil Corporation amounted to sales, even though the supplies were made pursuant to the directions and orders of the Central Gove1 nment and the Commission had no volition in the matter. Law presu~es assent of parties, it was observed, when there is transfer of goods from one party to the other. 40. This resume of cases, long as it is, may yet bear highlighting the true principle underlying the decisions of this Court which have taken the view that a transaction which is effected in compliance with the obligatory terms of a st8'ute may nevertheless be a sale in the eye of a law. The Indian Contract Act which was passed in 1872 contained provisions in its seventh chapter comprising Sections 76 to 123 relating to sale of goods which were repealed on the enactment of a comprehensive law of sale of p:oods in 1930. The Conttact Act drew inspiration from the English law of contract which is al- most entirely the creation of English courts and whose growth is marked by features which are peculiar to the social and economic history of England. Historically, the English law of contract is largely founded upon the action on the ca~e for assumpsit, where the essence of the matter was the under- taking. The necessity for acceptance of the undertaking or the promise led the earlier writers on legal theories to lay particular emphasis on the consensual nature of contractual obligations. It was out of the importance which political philosopher~ of the eighteenth century gave to human liberty that the doct1ine 33.

Adam Smith in his famous work on \"The Wealth of Nt.tions\" propounded in 1776 the view that the freedom of contract must as far as possible be left unimpaired. Gradually, as would appear from Friedmann's statement. in Law in a Changing Society3i freedom of contract-the freodom to contract on what~ver te1 ms might seem most advantageous to the individual-became a cornerstone of nineteenth-century laissez faire economics. Champions of individualist social philosophy who protested against legal and social restrictions in order to advance the policies of expansion and exploitation pursued by industry and commerce won their battle and \"freedom of contract was c,ne of the trophies of victory\"35 • The freedom and sanctit} of contract thus became \"the necessary instruments of laissez faire, and it was the function of the Courts to fostt\"r the on,: and to vindicate the other. Where a man sowed, there he should be able to reap\" .3' It is significant that the maxim itself-laissez faire, laissez passer-which derived from eighteenth century France has been commonly attributed to Goumay, at first a me1chant and later one of the intendants of commerce and a friend of Turgot. Turgot attributes the phrase laissez mous faire to another merchant, Legendre, who is said to have used it in impressing upon Colbert the desire on the part of the mercantile community for non-interference by the state. When Colbert asked a meeting of French businessmen what the state might do to assist them, Legendre pointedly replied, \"laissez-nous faire\". The under- lying assumption of the laissez faire doctrine turns on an optimistic view of the nature of the universe and on the conception of a \"natural orde1\" or system of economic harmonies which will prevail and work out to mankind's advantage in the absence of positive regulation. 37 4J. Towards the close of the nineteenth century it came to be realised that private enterprise, in order to be socially just, had to enc;ure economic equality : The very freedom of contract with its corollary, the freedom to com- pete, was merging into the freedom to combine ; and in the last resort l:ompetition and combination were incompatible. Individualism was yield- ing to monopoly, where strange- things might well be done in the name of liberty. The twentieth century has seen its progressive erosion on the one hand by opposed theory and on the other by conflicting practiC('. The background of the law, social, political and economic, has changed. Laissez foire as an ideal has been supplanted by 'social security' ; and social security suggests status rather than contract. The State may ·thus compel persons to make contracts, as where, by a series of Road Traffic Acts from 1930 to 1960, a motorist must insure against third-party risks ; it may, as by the Rent Restriction AGts, prevent one party to a contract 34. 1959 Chapter IV 35.

In many instances a statute prescribes the contents of the contract. The Moneylenders Act, 1927, dictates the terms of any loan caught by its provfsions ; the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924, contains six pages of rules to be incorporated in every contract for 'the carriage of goods by sea from any port in Great Britain or Northern Ireland to any other port' ; the Hire-Purchase Act, 1965, inserts into hire-purchase contracts a number of terms whioh the parties are fo1 bidden to exclude ; successive Landlord and Tenant Acts from 1927 to 1954 contain provisions expressed to apply 'notwithstanding any agreement to the contraty'. The erosion of con- tract by statute continues briskly ; and there are no immediate sign,;; of a reaction. 38 ln the words of Anson,39 Freedom of contract is a reasonable social ideal only to the e.>..tent that equality of ba1gaining powe1 between contracting parties can be assumed, and no injury is done to the economic inte1ests of the com- munity at large. In th~ more complicated social and industri.11 condi- tions of a collectivist society it has ceased to have much idealistic attrac- tion . It is now .ealised that economic equality often does not exist in any real sense, and that individual interests have to be made to subserve those of th'-· community. Hence there has been a fundamental change both in om social outlook and in the policy of the Legislature towards conhact, and the law today interferes at nume1ous points with the free- dom of the parties to make what contract they like .... This intervention is especially necessary today when most contracts entered into by ordinary people are not the result of individual negotiation. It is not possible for a private person to settle the terms of his agreement with the British Railways Board or with the local electricity authority. The 'standard form' contract is the rule. He must either accept the terms of this contract in toto, or go without. Since, however, it is not feasible to deprive oneself of such necessary services, the individual is compelled to accept on those terms. In view of this fact, it is quite clear that freedom of contract is now largely an illusion. 42. Anson is perhaps over-optimistic in saying that there has been a fundamental change in social outlook and in the legislative policy towards contract. Anyway, with the- high ideals of the Preamble and the Directive Principles of our Constitution there has to be such a fundamental change in judicial outlook. Instances givrn in Cheshire and Anson have their parallels in India too, wherein freedom of contract has largely become an illusion. The policy of our Parliament in regard to contracts, including those involved in salt: of goods, has still to reflect recognition of the necessity for a change, which could be done by a suitable modification of the definition of •sate• of goods. 43. It all began with the reliance in Gannon Dunkerley (supra) (pages 396-398) on the statement in the Eighth Edition (1950) of Benjamin on Sale that to constitute a valid sale there must be a concurrence of four elements, one of which is .. mutual assent\".

The majority judgmcnt in New India Sugar Mills (supra) (page 467) also derives sustenance from the same passage in Benjamin's eighth edition. But as observed by Hidayatullah J. in his dissenting judgment in that case, consent may be express or implied and offer and acceptance need not be in an elementary form (page 510). It is interesting that the General Editor of the 1974 edition of Benjamin's Sale of Goods says in the preface that the editors decided to produce an entirely new work partly because commercial institutions, modes of t1ansport and of payment, forms of contract, types of goods, market areas and marketing methods, and the extent of legislative and governmental regulation and intervention. had changed considerably since 1868, when the first edition of the book was _rublished. The formula- tions in Benjamin's second edition relating to the conditions of a valid •sale' of goods, which are reproduced in the eighth edition, evidently require modi- fication in the light of regulatory measures of social control. Hidayatullah, J., in his minority judgment referred to above struck the new path ; and Bachawat J. who spoke for the Court in Andhra Sugars (supra) went a step ahead by declaring that \"the contract is a contract of sale and purchase of cane, though the buyer is obJiged to give his assent under compulsion of a statute\" (page 716). The concept of freedom of contract, as observed by Hegde, J . in Indian Steel and Wire Productions (supra), has undergone a great deal of change even in those countries where it was considere-d as one of the basic economic requi1 e- mrnts of a democratic life (page 490). Thus, in Ridge Nominees Ltd. (supra), the Court of Apreat, while r~iecting the argument that there was no sale because the essential element of mutual assent was lacking, held that the dissent of the shareholder was o,eniden by an assent which the statute imposed on him, fictional though it may be, that a sale may not always require the consensual element mentioned in Bmjamin on Sale40 , and that there may in truth be a compulsory sale of property with which the owner is compelled to pa1 t for a price against his will (pages 405-406). Decisions in cases of 'compulscry acquisition', where such acquisition is patent as in Kirknt>ss (supra) or is in- ferred as in Chhitter Mai (supra) fall in a separate and distinct class. The observations of Lord Reid in Kirknnss (supra) that 'sale' is a nomen juris- the name of a particulat consensual contract-have therefore to be under- stood in the context in which they were made, namely, that compulsory acqui- sition cannot amount to sale. In Gannon Dunkerley (supra), Venkatarama Aiyar, J. was influenced largely by these observations (see rages 411 , 412 and 425) and by the definition of 'sale' in Benjamin's eighth edition. Gannon Dunker/C'y (supra) involved an altogether different point and is not an autho- rity for the proposition that there cannot at aU be a contract of sale if the parties to c1 transaction are obliged to comply with the terms of a statute. Since we are putting in a nutshell what we have discussed earlier, we would like to re- iterate in the interest of unifo. mity and ce1 tainty of law that, with great defere-nce the majority decision in New India Sugar Mills (supra) is not good law.

(concurring)-1 am in general agreement with my teamed brother Chandrachud who has discussed all the authorities so admirably and comprehensively. I, however, would like to add a few observations stating the general conclusion, as I see it, emerging from an apJ: lication of general prin- ciples and accumulation of case-law on the subject of what may be called .. statutory\" or \"compulsory\" sales. Are they sales at all so as to be exigible to sales tax 01 purchase tax under the relevant statutory provisions ? 47. The term 'sale' is defined as follows in Benjamin on Sale (Eighth Edn.) : To constitute a valid sale there must be a concurrence of the following elements, namely : (1) parties competent to contract ; (2) mutual assent ; (3) a thing, the absolute or general property in which is transferred from the seller to the buyer ; and (4) a price in money paid or promised.- 48. It is true that a considerable part of the field over which what are called 'sales' take place under either regulatory orders 01 levy orders passed or directions given under statutory provisions is restricted and controlled by these orders and directions. If, what is called a \"sale\" is, in substance, mere obedience to a specific order, in which the so-called \"price\" is only a com- pensation for the compulsory passing of property in goods to which an order relates, at an amount fixed by the authority making the order, the individual transaction may not be a \"sale\" although the compensation is determined on some generally fixed principle and called \"price\".

That was a case of a delivery according to an order given by the Government which could amount to a compulsory levy by an executive order although there was no legislative \"lovy order\" involved in that case. On the other hand, in Commissioner, Sales Tax, U. P. v. Ram Bi/as Ram Gopal0 , the order und,.r consideration was actually called a levy order, but the case was distin- guishable from New India Sugar Mills v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar (supra) on f&.cts. It was held in the case of Ram Bilas (supra) that the core, of what is required for a \"sale\" was not destroyrd by tho so-called \"levy\" ordor which was legislative. It is true that passages from the judgment of Pathak, J., in the case of Ram Bi/as Ram Gopal (supra) were cited and speci- fically disapproved by a bench of this Court in Chhitter Mai Narain v. Commis- sioner of Sales Tax'-8. But, perhaps the view of this Court in Chhitter Mai Narain Das (supra) goes too far in this respect. It is not really the nomenclature of the order involved, but the substance of the transaction under considera- tion which matters in such cases. 49. In the first type of case mentioned above the substance of the concept of a sale, as found under our Law, itself disappears because the transaction is nothing more than the execution of an order. Deprivation of property for a compensation, which may even be described as \"price\", does not amount to a sale when all that is done is to \"arry out an order so that the transaction is substantially a compulsory acquisition. On the other hand, a merely regu- latory law, even if it circumscribes the area of free choice, does not take away the basic character or core of sale from the transaction. Such a law, which governs a class, ma) oblige sellers to doal only with parties holding licences who may buy particular or allotted quantities of goods at specified prices, but an essential element of choice is still left to the parties between whom agreements take place. The agreement, despite considerable compulsive elements regu- lating or restricting the area of free choice, may still retain the basic character of a transaction of sale. This was the position in Indian Steel and Wire Pro- ducts Ltd. v. State of Madrus\" ; Andhra Sugars Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pra- desh\"' ; and State of Rajasthan v. Kar\"m Chand Thapar 46• There might be borderline cases in which it may be difficult to draw the line. 50. In the former type of case, the binding character of the transaction arises from the order directed to particular parties asking them to deliver speci- fied goods and not from a general 01der or law applicable te a class. In the latter type of cases. the legal tie (vinculum juris which binds the parties to perform their obligations remains <.,ontractual. The regulatory law merely adds other obligations, such as the one to enter into such a tie between the parties indicated there. Although the regulatory law might specify the terms, 41.

TAX OFFICER (Beg, C.J.) 5Sl such as price, or parties, the 1egulation is subsidiary to the essential character of the transaction which is consensual and contractual. The basis of a con- tract is : \"consensus ad idem\". The pa1ties to the contract must agree upon the same thing in the same sense. Agreement on mutality of consideration, ordinarily arising from an offer and acceptance, imparts to it enforceability in Courts qf law. Mere regulation or restriction of the field of choice does not take away the contractual or essentially consensual binding core or character of the transaction. 51. I may be forgiven for citing a passage flom my judgment in Com- missioner of Sales Tax v. Ram Bi/as Ram Gopal\" to indicate the setting of such transactions : It appears to me to be necessary to distinguish between a restric- tion in the area of choice of parties and the transaction itself in order to determine the true character of. the transaction. Limitation of the field of choice is a necessa1y concomitant of a controlled or mixed economy which ours is. Absolute freedom of contract or unregulated operation of the laws of supply and demand, which an apotheosis of the laissez faire doctrine demanded, led i;-eally to a sfuinking of the area of freedom in the economic sphere, producing gross inequalities in bargaining powers and recurrent crises. Therefore, a regulated or a socialistic economy seeks to regulate the r lay of forces operating on the economic arena so that economic freedom of all concerned, including employers and em- ployees, is preserved and so that the interests of consumers are also not sactificed by any exploitation of conditions in which there is scarcity of goods. I think that the regulation or restriction of the area of choice cannot be held to take away the legal character of the transactions which take place within the legally restricted field. It is too late in the day, when so much of the nation's social and economic activities are guided and governed by control orders, allotment orde-rs, and statut<.'ry con- tracts, to contend that mere State regulation of the economic sphere of life results in the destruction of the nature of the transactions which take place within that sphere. 52. In Roman Law the contract of sale was classed as a \"consensual\" contract. The consent could, no doubt, be express or implied. I find that Hidayatullah J., in his very learned dissenting judgment in New India Sugar Mills case (supra), where some Roman Law is referred to, thought that even in a case of a specific order directing delivery of goods there could be an im- plied consent so as to constitute a sale. I find it, with great respect, difficult to go so far as that. What could be implied, upon the facts of a particular case, must still be a consent to a proposal if the transaction is to be construed as a \"sale\". Mere compliance with an order may imply an acceptance of an order but acceptance of a proposal to purchase or sell are of a juristically different genus. It is, however, not necessary for us, in this case, to accept the correctness of the minority view of Hidayatullah, J. in New India Sugar Mil/s's case (supra).
