VIII, r. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and if time can be extended for filing of written submissions in a suit under theesaid provision of the Code, the same would apply to the filing of response to a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act as well, and hence the provision of s. 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act would be directory and not mandatory – Held: It is noteworthy that Or. VIII, r. 1 r/w. Or. VIII, r. 10 prescribes that the maximum period of 120 days provided u/or. VIII, r. 1 is actually not meant to be mandatory but only directory – Or. VIII, r. 10 mandates that where written statement is not filed within the time provided u/or. VIII, r. 1 “ The Court shall pronounce the judgment against him or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit” – It is clearly indicative of the fact that the discretions is left with the Court to grant time beyond the maximum period of 120 days, which may. VIII, r. 1 of the Code is not followed by any consequence within the time so provided in the Code – Whereas, sub-section (2)(b)(ii) of s. 13 of the Consumer Protection Act clearly provides for the consequence of the complaint to be proceeded ex- parte against the opposite party, if the opposite party omits or fails to represent his case within the time given – Once consequences are provided for not filing the response to the complaint within the time specified, and it is further provided that proceedings complying with the procedure laid down under sub section (1) and (2) of s. 13 of the Consumer Protection Act shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that the principles of natural justice have not been complied with, the intention of the legislature is absolutely clear that the provisions of s.13(2)(a) of the Act in specifying the time limit for filing the response to the complaint is mandatory, and not directory – The provisions of Or.VIII, r.1 of the Code are directory not mandatory, however, it would not be applicable to cases dealing with the provisions of s. 13(2) of the Consumer Protection Act, or such other enactment wherein a provision akin to s.13(2) is there and the consequences are also provided. Consumer Protection Act, 1986 – s. 13 – Limitation of 30 days u/s. 13 of the 1986 Act – Commencing point of – Held: Sub- A B D E F G H 431 sections(2) (a) and (2)(b) of s. 13 of the Consumer Protection Act specify that it is a copy of the complaint which is to be given to thety directing him to give his version of the case within a period of 30 days or such extended period, not exceeding 15 daysAs such, from the aforesaid provision itself, it is clear that it is the copy of the admitted complaint which is to be served, after whichesponse would commence – Further, Regulation 10 of the Consumer Protection Regulations, 2005 also specified the procedure of issuing notice, which should be accompanied by copy of the complaint – Therefore, the commencing point of limitation of 30 days u/s. 13 of the Consumer Protection Act would be from the date of receipt of the notice accompanied with the complaint by the opposite party, and not mere receipt of the notice of the complaint. Answering the reference, the Court Whether the District Forum has power to extend the time for filing of response to the complaint beyond the period of 15 days, in addition to 30 days, as envisaged under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act? 1. A bare reading of Section 13(2)(a) of the Act makes it clear that the copy of the complaint which is to be sent to thety, is to be with the direction to give his version of (or response to) the case (or complaint) within a period of 30 2. Sub-Section (2)(a) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for the opposite party to give his response ‘within a period of 30 days or such extended period not exceeding 15 days as may be granted by the District Forum’. The intention of the legislature seems to be very clear that the opposite party would get the time of 30 days, and in addition another 15 days at 3. The legislature in its wisdom has provided for filing of complaint or appeals beyond the period specified under the NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. A B D E F G H 432 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. relevant provisions of the Act and Regulations, if there is sufficient cause given by the party, which has to be to the satisfaction of the concerned authority. No such discretion has been provided for under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act for filing a response to the complaint beyond the extended period of 45ovision mandatory but only directory, the provision for further extension of the period for filing the response beyondTo carve out an exception in a specific provision of the statute is not within the 4. By specifically enacting a provision under sub-Section (3) of Section 13, with a specific clarification that violation of the Protection Act has been followed or complied with, the intention of the legislature is clear that mere denial ofAct. [Para 17][450-B-C] 5. It is true that ‘justice hurried is justice buried’. But in the same breath it is also said that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’. The legislature has chosen the latter, and for a good reason. It goes with the objective sought to be achieved by the Consumerotection Act, which is to provide speedy justice to the consumer. It is not that sufficient time to file a response to the complaint has been denied to the opposite party. It is just that discretion of extension of time beyond 15 days (after the 30 daysotection Act. It may be that in some cases the opposite party could face hardship because of such provision, yet for achievingAct, which is speedy and simple redressal of consumer disputes, hardship which may be caused to a party has A B D E F G H 433 6. It has been further contended that the language of Section 13(2) of the Consumer Protection Act is pari materia to Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and ifotection Act as well, and hence the provision of Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act would be directory and not mandatory. In this regard, what is noteworthy is that Regulation 26 of the Consumer Protection Regulation, 2005, clearlyeferred to in the Consumer Protection Act and the Regulations framed thereunder, which is provided for in respect of specific matters enumerated in Section 13(4) of the Consumerotection Act. It is pertinent to note that non-filing of written statement under Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code is not followed, while considering the relevant provisions of the Code, it is noteworthy that Order VIII Rule 1 read with Ordery, but only directory. Order VIII Rule 10 mandates that where written statement is not filed within the time provided under“the court shall pronounce the judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit”. A harmonious construction of these provisions is clearly indicative of the fact that the discretion is left with the Court to grant time Protection Act clearly provides for the consequence of the complaint to be proceeded ex parte against the opposite party, if the opposite party omits or fails to represent his case within the time given. [Para 21][452-E-H; 453-A-B] 7. Once consequences are provided for not filing the response to the complaint within the time specified, and it is Protection Act shall not be called in question in any NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v.

Court on the ground that the principles of natural justice haveAct in specifying the time limit for filing the response to the complaint is mandatory, and not directory. [Para 21] [453-F-G] 8. After noticing that there were delays in deciding the complaints by the District Forum, the legislature inserted sub- Protection Act providing for a time limit for deciding the complaints. From thisetion to the Forum that wherever necessary, the extension of the time can be provided for, and where such further extension is not to be granted [as in the case of Section 13(2)(a)], the legislature has consciously not provided for the same, so as toAct. [Para 22][453-H; 454-A-B] What would be the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986? 9. For deciding this question, this Court may first analyse the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and the Regulations framed thereunder. Sub-Sections (2)(a) and (2)(b) of Section13 of the Consumer Protection Act specify that it is the copy of the complaint which is to given to the opposite party such extended period, not exceeding 15 days. As such, from the aforesaid provision itself, it is clear that it is the copy ofesponse would commence. Further, Regulation 10 of the Consumer Protection Regulations, 2005 also specifiesalong with the notice, copies of the complaint, memorandum of grounds of appeal, petitions as the case may be and other documents make it clear that it is on service of a copy A B D E F G H 435 of the complaint that the period of limitation for filing the response 10. Now reverting to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, a conjoint reading of Clauses (a) and (b) of sub- Section (2) of Section 13 would make the position absolutely clearty, he would not be in a position to furnish its reply. Thus, mere service of notice, without service of the copy of the complaint, would not sufficeAct. This Court may, however, clarify that the objection of not having received a copy of the complaint alongeafter, otherwise if permitted to be raised at any point later would defeat the very purpose of the Act, which is to provide simple and speedy redressal of consumer disputes. 11. To conclude, the answer to the first question is that the District Forum has no power to extend the time for filing the response to the complaint beyond the period of 15 days in additionotection Act; and the answer to the second question is that the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13 Protection Act would be from the date of receipt of the notice accompanied with the complaint by the oppositety, and not mere receipt of the notice of the complaint.

A B D E F G H 439 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Leave granted. 2. The reference made to this Constitution Bench relates to the grant of time for filing response to a complaint under the provisions ofAct, 1986 (for short ‘the Act’). The first question referred is as to whether Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act, which provides for the respondent/opposite party filing its response to the complaint within 30 days or such extended period, notsecond question which is referred is as to what would be the commencing point of limitation of 30 days stipulated under the aforesaid Section. 3. The first question was referred by a two judge Bench of this Court vide an Order dated 11.02.2016 passed in Civil Appeal No(s).1083-1084 of 2016, M/s Bhasin Infotech and Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. versus M/s Grand Venezia Buyers Association (Reg), the relevant portion of which is as under: “There is an apparent conflict between the decisions of this Court in Topline Shoes Limited vs. Corporation Bank [(2002) 6 SCC 33], Kailash Vs. Nankhu [(2005) 4 SCC 480], Salemchant & Ors. Vs. Shrinath Chaturvedi [(2002) 6 SCC 635 and NIA Vs. Hilli Multipurposetorage [2014 AIOL 4615] on the other in so far as the power of the Courts to extend time for filing of writteneply to a complaint is concerned. The earlier mentioned line of decisions take the view that the relevant provisions including those of Order 8 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 are directory in nature and the Courts concerned have the power to extend time for filing the writtene also of coordinate Benches however takes a contrary view and hold that when it comes to power of the Consumer Fora to extendeply there is no such power. NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. A B D E F G H 440 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. Since the question that falls for determination here often arises before the Consumer Fora and Commissions all over the country it will be more appropriate if the conflict is resolved by an authoritative judgment. Further since the conflict isee Judges we deem it fit to refer these appeals to a five-Judge Bench to resolve the conflict once and for all. While we do so we are mindful of the fact that in the ordinary course a two-Judge Bench ought to make a reference to a three-Judge Bench in the first place but in the facts and circumstances of the case and keeping in view the fact that the conflict is between coordinate Benches comprising three Judges a reference to three Judges may not suffice.” The other question has been referred by another Division Bench of this Court by an Order dated 18.01.2017 passed in this very appealCivil Appeal No(s).10941-10942 of 2013, NIA Vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd, the relevant portion of the judgment is as under: “……….what is the commencing point of the limitation of 30Act is required to be decided authoritatively. The declaration made in JJ Merchant’s case that the said period is to be reckoned from the date of the receipt of the notice by the opposite party or complaint under the Act requires in our humble opinion, a more critical analysis.” We have heard the learned Counsel for the parties at length and have carefully gone through the records. 6. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Consumer Protection Act, in paragraph 4, it has been specifically provided that the Consumer Protection Act is “To provide speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes, a quasi-judicial machinery is sought to betate and Central levels…….”. The Preamble of the Consumer Protection Act also mentions that the Act is “to provide for better protection of the interests of the consumers”. The nomenclature of this Act also goes to show that it is for the benefit or protection of the consumer. From the above, it is evident that the Consumer Protection Act has been enacted to provide for expeditious A B D E F G H 441 disposal of consumer disputes and that, it is for the protection and benefit. 7. Before we proceed to analyse and determine the questions referred, we may, for ready reference, reproduce the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and its Regulations. “Section 13.

(2)……………….. (emphasis supplied) Question No. 1: Whether the District Forum has power to extend the time for filing of response to the complaint A B D E F G H 447 envisaged under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumerotection Act? 8. A bare reading of Section 13(2)(a) of the Act makes it clear that the copy of the complaint which is to be sent to the opposite party, is to be with the direction to give his version of (or response to) the case 9. Sub-Section 2(b)(i) of Section 13 of the Act provides for a complaint to be decided on the basis of the response by the opposite, where allegations contained in the complaint are denied or disputed by the. Sub-Section 2(b)(ii) of Section 13 of the Act provides that where no response is filed by the opposite party, the complaint may be decided ex parte on the basis of evidence brought forth by the complainant. 10. Sub-Section 2(c) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act further provides that where the complainant fails to appear on the[sub-Section 2(c)] was inserted by Act 62 of 2002, w.e.f. 15.03.2003. Similarly, Section (3A) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, which was also inserted by Act 62 of 2002, provides for deciding every complaint as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to decide the complaint within a period of three months, and within five months, if the complaint requires analysis or testing of commodities. It also 11. From the above, it is clear that as mentioned in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Consumer Protection Act, the District Forum is to provide speedy disposal of consumer disputes. The sameAct 62 of 2002. NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 448 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. 12. Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act clearly contemplates where time can be extended by the District Forum, and, but only directory. The phrase “endeavour shall be made”, makes the intention of the legislature evident that the District Forum is to make every effort 13. On the contrary, sub-Section (2)(a) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for the opposite party to give his response ‘within a period of 30 days or such extended period not exceeding 15 days as may be granted by the District Forum’. The intention of the legislature seems to be very clear that the opposite partyAct. The question of natural justice is dealt with by the legislature in sub-Section (3) of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, which clearly provides that “No proceedings complying with the procedure laid down in the sub-Section (1) and (2) shall be called in questiont on the ground that the principles of natural justice have not been complied with.” The legislature was conscious that the complaint would result in being decided ex parte, or without the response of the opposite party, if not filed within such time as provided under the Consumer Protection Act, and in such a case, the opposite party will not be allowed to take the plea that he was not given sufficient time or thatAny other interpretation would defeat the very purpose of sub-Section (3) of SectionAct. 14. The maximum period of 45 days, as provided under the Consumer Protection Act, would not mean that the complainant has a right to always avail such maximum period of 45 days to file its response. A B D E F G H 449 shall be issued for a period of 30 days, but the same can be even less 15. Now, reverting back to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act to consider as to whether the provision of sub-Section 2(a) of Section 13 granting a maximum period of 15 days in addition toAct where the legislature intended to allow extension of period of limitation. Section 15 of the Consumer Protection Act provides for filing of an appeal from the order of the District Forum to the State Commission, it leaves a discretion with the State Commission to entertain an appeal filed after the expiry of the said, discretion for filing an appeal before the National Commission beyond the period of 30 days has alsoAct. Section 24A provides for the limitation period of 2 years for filing the complaint. However, sub-Section (2) of Section 24A gives a discretion to entertain a complaint even after the period of 2 years, if there is a 16. Regulation 14 of the Consumer Protection Regulations, 2005 also deals with limitation. In addition, the same provides for limitation 17. The legislature in its wisdom has provided for filing of complaint or appeals beyond the period specified under the relevant provisions ofAct and Regulations, if there is sufficient cause given by the party, which has to be to the satisfaction of the concerned authority. No such discretion has been provided for under Section 13(2)(a) of the ConsumerAct for filing a response to the complaint beyond the extended period of 45 days (30 days plus 15 days). Had the legislature not wanted, the provision for further extension of the period for filing the response beyond 45 daysTo carve out an exception in a specific provision NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 450 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. of the statute is not within the jurisdiction of the Courts, and if it is so By specifically enacting a provision under sub-Section (3) of Section 13, with a specific clarification that violation of the principles ofAct has been followed or complied with, the intention of the legislature is clear that mere denial of further extension of time for filingAct. 18. This Court in the case of Lachmi Narain vs Union of India (1976) 2 SCC 953 has held that “if the provision is couched in prohibitive or negative language, it can rarely be directory, the use of peremptory language in a negative form is per se indicative of the interest that the provision is to be mandatory”. Further, hardship cannot be a ground for changing the mandatory nature of the statute, asBhikraj Jaipurai vs Union of India AIR 1962 SC 113=(1962) 2 SCR 880 and Fairgrowth Investments Ltd. Vs Custodian (2004) 11 SCC 472. Hardship cannot thus be a ground to interpret the provision so as to enlarge the time, where the statute This Court, in the case of Rohitash Kumar vs Om Prakash Sharma (2013) 11 SCC 451 has, in paragraph 23, held as under: “23. There may be a statutory provision, which causes great hardship or inconvenience to either the party concerned, or to an individual, but the Court has no choice but to enforce it in full rigor. It is a well settled principle of interpretation that hardship or inconvenience caused, cannot be used as a basis to alter the meaning of the language employed by thee, if such meaning is clear upon a bare perusal of the statute. If the language is plain and hence allows onlydship or possible injustice.” A B D E F G H 451 While concluding, it was observed “that the hardship caused to an individual, cannot be a ground for not giving effective and grammatical meaning to every word of the provision, if the language used therein, is unequivocal.” Further, it has been held by this Court in the case of Popat Bahiru Govardhane vs Special Land Acquisition Officer (2013) 10 SCC 765 that the law of limitation may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its vigour when the statute so prescribes and. 19. The contention of the learned Counsel for the respondent is that by not leaving a discretion with the District Forum for extending the, grave injustice would be caused as there could be circumstances beyond, if the law so provides, the same has to be strictly complied, so as to achieve the object of the statute. It is, as equity can only supplement the law, and not supplant it. This Court, in the case of Laxminarayan R. Bhattad vs State of Maharashtra (2003) 5 SCC 413,has observed that “when there is a conflict between law and equity the former shall prevail.” In P.M. Latha vs State of Kerala (2003) 3 SCC 541, this Court held that “Equity and law are twin brothers and law should be applied and interpreted equitably, but equity cannot override written or settled law.” In Nasiruddin vs Sita Ram Agarwal (2003) 2 SCC 577,this Court observed that “in a case where the statutory provision is plain and unambiguous, the court shall not interpret the same in a different manner, only because of harsh consequences arising therefrom.” In E. Palanisamy vs Palanisamy (2003) 1 SCC 123, it was held that “Equitable considerations have no place where the statute contained express provisions.” Further, in India House vs Kishan N. Lalwani (2003) 9 SCC 393,this Court held that “The period of limitation statutorily prescribed has to be strictly adhered to and cannot be relaxed or departed from by equitable considerations.” NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 452 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. It is thus settled law that where the provision of the Act is clear and unambiguous, it has no scope for any interpretation on equitable 20. It is true that ‘justice hurried is justice buried’. But in the same breath it is also said that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’. The legislature has chosen the latter, and for a good reason. It goes with the objective sought to be achieved by the Consumer Protection Act, which is to provide speedy justice to the consumer. It is not that sufficient time to file a response to the complaint has been denied to the opposite party. It is just that discretion of extension of time beyond 15 days (after the 30Act, which is speedy and simple redressal of consumer disputes, hardship which 21. It has been further contended that the language of Section 13(2) of the Consumer Protection Act is pari materia to Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short ‘the Code’) andAct as well, and hence the provision of Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act would be directory and not mandatory. In this regard, what is noteworthy is that Regulation 26 of the Consumer Protection Regulation, 2005, clearly mandates that endeavour, which is provided for in respect of specific matters enumerated in Section 13(4) of the ConsumerAct. It is pertinent to note that non-filing of written statement under Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code is not followed by any consequence Now, while considering the relevant provisions of the Code, it is noteworthy that Order VIII Rule 1 read with Order VIII Rule 10, but only directory. A B D E F G H 453 Order VIII Rule 10 mandates that where written statement is not filed“the court shall pronounce the judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit”. A harmonious construction of these provisions is clearly indicative of the fact that the discretion is left with the Court toAct clearly provides for the consequence of the complaint to be proceeded ex parte against the opposite party, if the opposite party omits or fails to represent his case within the time It may further be noted that in Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code, for suits filed under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, a proviso has been inserted for ‘commercial disputes of a specified value’ (vide Act 4 of 2016 w.r.e.f. 23.10.2015), which reads as under: “Provided further that no Court shall make an Order to extend the time provided under Rule 1 of this Order for filing the written statement” written statement provided under Order VIII Rule 1 is meant to be, but not so for ordinary civil suits. Similarly, in our considered view, for cases under the Consumer Protection Act also, the time provided under Section 13(2)(a) of the Act has to be read as mandatory, and not directory. Once consequences are provided for not filing the response to the complaint within the time specified, and it is further provided thatAct shall not be called in question in any Court on the ground that the principles of naturalAct in specifying the time limit for filing the response to the complaint is mandatory, and not directory. 22. After noticing that there were delays in deciding the complaints by the District Forum, the legislature inserted sub-Section (3A) of SectionAct providing for a time limit for deciding the complaints. From this it is amply clear that the intention of the NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 454 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. legislature was, and has always been, for expeditious disposal of the, the extension of the time can be provided for, and where such further extension is not to be granted [as in the case of Section 13(2)(a)], the legislature has consciously not provided for the same, so as to achieve the object of the 23. In SCG Contracts (India) Private Limited vs K.S. Chamankar Infrastructure Private Limited (2019) 12 SCC 210, this Court, was dealing with a case relating to the filing of written statementAct, 2015. After noticing the amendments brought in Order V Rule 1, Order VIII Rule 1 and Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code with regard tocial disputes of specified value’ under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 by way of insertion of the Provisos in the aforesaid provisions,“….the clear, definite and mandatory provisions of Order V read with Order VIII Rule 1 and 10 cannot be circumvented by recourse to the inherent power under Section 151 to do the opposite of what is stated therein”. It was, thus, held that there was no scope for enlarging the time for filing of written statement, and not directory. The said judgment has been affirmed by a Bench of three Judges in Desh Raj vs Balkishan decided on 20.01.2020 in Civil Appeal No.433 of 2020. 24. In Fairgrowth Investments Ltd. Vs Custodian (2004) 11 SCC 472, this Court was dealing with the provisions of the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992, and the question was whether the Special Court has power to condone theAct. While holding, that the said provision would be mandatory, it was held in paragraph 13 as under: “13. It is not for the courts to determine whether the periodectory because of such alleged inadequacy of time.” A B D E F G H 455 Then, after considering the decisions of this Court in Topline Shoes Ltd. vs. Corporation Bank (2002) 6 SCC 33and Dr. J. J. Merchant vs. Shrinath Chaturvedi (2002) 6 SCC 635, this Court held that “the period for filing an objection in Section 4(2) in the Act is ay provision given the language of the Section and having regard to the objects sought to be served by the Act.” 25. Certain other cases, which have been referred to by the learned Counsel for the parties, have, in our considered opinion, no directAct, and thus, the same are not being dealt with and considered here. 26. We may now deal with the decisions rendered by this Court, which have been referred to in the Reference Order. 27. Division Bench of this Court has referred this Question, after observing that there is an apparent conflict between the decisions of thisTopline Shoes (supra); Kailash Vs. Nanhku (2005) 4 SCC 480 and Salem Advocate Bar Association vs. Union of India (2005) 6 SCC 344 on the one hand; and Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra)and NIA vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (2015) 16 SCC 22,on the other hand. 28. In Topline Shoes (supra), a Division Bench of this Court, while dealing with the provisions of Section 13(2)(a) of the ConsumerAct, has held that the said provision would be directory and not mandatory. While holding so, the Bench relied on the principles of natural justice, and also that no consequence of non-filing of the response In paragraph 8 of the said judgment, this Court held:cumstances along with the provisions of the Act providing time-frame to file reply, as a guideline and then to exercise its discretion as best as it may serve the ends of justice and achieve the object of speedy disposal of such cases (emphasis supplied) NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 456 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. It is true that in Clause 4 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Consumer Protection Act, the legislature provided that “quasi– judicial bodies will observe the principles of natural justice”,, the same is to be observed generally, and not where the same is specifically excluded. In the said judgment, sub-Section (3) of SectionAct, the law mandates that the principles of natural justice cannot be said to be violated by adopting In case of Topline Shoes (supra), this Court was also of the view that in the Consumer Protection Act, “no consequence is provided in case the time granted to file reply exceeds the total period of 45 days”. While observing so, the Bench did not take into account the provisions of Section 13(2)(b)(ii) of the Consumer Protection Act, which provides that where the opposite party fails to file response to the complaintthe District Forum shall proceed to settle the consumer dispute……… on the basis of evidence brought to its notice by the complainant……..”. After the said judgment, by Amendment Act 62 of 2002 (w.e.f. 15.03.2003), the legislature has provided that the District Forum shall proceed to settle“ ex parte on the basis of the evidence”. The word “ex parte” has been added by the Amending Act. As we have observed herein above, the consequence of not filing the response to the 29. In the case of Kailash vs. Nanhku (supra), this Court was dealing with an election trial under the Representation of People Act, 1951, and while considering the provision under Order VIII Rule 1 of, and not mandatory. While holding so, the Court was of the view that “the consequences flowing from non-extension of time are not specifically provided” in the Code. The decision in the said case has no bearing on the question under A B D E F G H 457 consideration, as the present reference before us is under the ConsumerAct, where, as we have already observed, consequences are specifically provided for. In passing, in paragraph 35 of the said judgment, the Bench referred to the case of Topline Shoes(supra), where the provision of Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act was considered to be directory, and not mandatory. In our view, the same would not have the effect of affirming the decision of Topline Shoes (supra) since the Court, in the aforesaid case, was dealing with the provisions of the Code and not the specificAct. We are thus of the opinion that Kailash vs Nanhku (supra) has not overruled the decision in Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra) with regard to the provision of the Consumer Protection Act. 30. Again, in the case of Salem Advocates Bar Association (supra), this Court was dealing with a case under Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code and in paragraph 20, it has been held as under: “20.………The use of the word “shall” is ordinarily indicative of mandatory nature of the provision but having regard to the context in which it is used or having regard to the intention of the legislation, the same can be construed as directory. The rule in question has to advance the cause of justice andules of procedure are made to advance the cause of justice and not to defeat it. Construction of theule or procedure which promotes justice and prevents miscarriage has to be preferred. The rules of procedure are the handmaid of justice and not its mistress. In the present context, the strict interpretation would defeat justice.” Thereafter, the Court proceeded to refer to the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1, along with Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code. On a harmonious, and not mandatory. Relevant paragraph 21 of the said judgment is below: “21. In construing this provision, support can also be had from Order 8 Rule 10 which provides that where any party from whom a written statement is required under Rule 1 or Rule 9, fails to present the same within the time permitted or NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 458 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. fixed by the court, the court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. On failure to file written statement under this provision, the court has been given the discretion either to pronounce judgment against the defendant or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. In the context of the provision, despite use of the word “shall”, the court has been given the discretion to pronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the defendant even if the writtender as it may think fit in relation to the suit. In construing the provision of Order 8 Rule 1 and Rule 10, the doctrine of harmonious construction is required to be applied. The effect would be that under Rule 10 Order 8, the court in its discretion would have the power to allow the defendant to file written statementy of the period of 90 days provided in Order 8 Rule 1. There is no restriction in Order 8 Rule 10 that after expiry of ninety days, further time cannot be granted. Thet has wide power to “make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit”. Clearly, therefore, the provision of Order 8 Rule 1 providing for the upper limit of 90 days to file written statement is directory”. As such in our view, the said judgment would hold the field with regard to Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code and would not be applicable toAct, or such other enactment wherein a provision akin to Section 13(2) is there and the consequences are also provided. 31. The case of Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra)is one relating to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, and has been decided by a Bench of three Judges of this Court (which is after the decision in theTopline Shoes (supra) was rendered). In this case it has been held that the time limit prescribed for filing the response to the complaintAct, as provided under Section 13(2)(a), is to be strictly adhered to, i.e. the same is mandatory, and not directory. In paragraph 13 of the said judgment, it has been held that: “For having speedy trial, this legislative mandate of not givinge than 45 days in submitting the written statement or the A B D E F G H 459 version of the case is required to be adhered to. If this is not adhered to, the legislative mandate of disposing of the cases within three or five months would be defeated. In the said case of Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra),while holding that the time limit prescribed would be mandatory and thus be required to beAct 62 of 2002 and has come in force w.e.f. 15.03.2003). The salient features of the same was “to provide simple, inexpensive and speedy justice to the consumers……….”“the disposal of cases is to be faster” and after noticing that “several bottlenecks and shortcomings have also come to light inovisions of the Act” and with a view to achieve quicker disposal of consumer complaints, certain amendmentsAct, which included “(iii) prescribing the period within which complaints are to be admitted, notices are to be issued to opposite party and complaints are to be decided”. With this object in mind, in sub-Section (2)(b)(ii) of Section 13, the opening sentence has been substituted by “ ex parte on the basis of evidence”. By this amendment, consequences of not filing the response to the complaint within the specified limit of 45 days was to beex parte on the basis of evidence brought to its notice by the complainant, where the opposite party omits or fails to take action to represent his It was after observing so, and considering aforesaid amendments, this Court held that the time limit of 30 plus 15 days in filing the response NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 460 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. 32. The decision of another Bench of three Judges in NIA vs Hilli Multipurpose Coldstorage (supra),which has been considered in the referring order was passed by a bench of two Judges in the sameDr. J. J. Merchant (supra) and Kailash vs Nanhku (supra). After considering the provisions of the Code and Consumer Protection Act, the reference was answered “that the law laid down by a three Judge Bench of this Court in Dr. J. J. Merchant (supra)should prevail”. In coming to this conclusion, the following was observed in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the said judgment: “25. We are, therefore, of the view that the judgment delivered in J.J. Merchant holds the field and therefore, we reiterate the view that the District Forum can grant a further period ofty for filing his version or reply and not beyond that.e is one more reason to follow the law laid down in J.J. Merchant. J.J. Merchant was decided in 2002, whereas Kailash was decided in 2005. As per law laid down by thisespected the view expressed in J.J. Merchant as the judgment delivered in J.J. Merchant was earlier in point of time. The aforesaid legal position cannot be ignored by us and therefore, we are of the opinion that the view expressed in J.J. Merchant should be followed.” Although, after the above decision, no further reference was required to be made, but still we have proceeded to answer the questionDr. J. J. Merchant (supra) is the correct view. Question No. 2: What would be the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection 34. The question for determination is whether the limitation under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act for filing the response by the opposite party to the complaint would commence from the date of receipt, or the receipt of notice accompanied by a copy of the complaint. A B D E F G H 461 35. In paragraph 12 of the judgment dated 04.12.2015, of three Judge Bench of this Court, in this very case of NIA vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (supra), while referring to the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13(2) of the ConsumerAct, it has been held that “The whole issue centres round the period within which the opponent has to give his version to theAct. Upon receipt of a complaint by the District Forum, if the complaint is admitted under Section 12 of the Act, aovisions of Section 13 of the Act, the opposite party has to give his version of the case within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the copy of the complaint.” 36. However, another two judge Bench of this Court, by an Order dated 18.01.2017 passed in this very Appeal being Civil Appeal No(s).10941-10942 of 2013, NIA Vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage,has expressed the view that the declaration made in Dr. J. J. Merchant’scase to the effect that the said period is to be reckoned from the date of receipt of notice by the opposite party or complaintAct,requires a more critical analysis. The bench thus opined that “what is the commencing point of the limitation of 30 days stipulated in Section 13 of the Act is required to be decided authoritatively”. It is thus that this question has been placed before us for an authoritative decision. 37. For deciding this question, we may first analyse the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and the Regulations framed thereunder. Sub-Sections (2)(a) and (2)(b) of Section13 of the Consumer Protection Act specify that it is the copy of the complaint which is to given to the opposite party directing him to give his version of the caseAs such, from the aforesaid provision itself, it is clear that it is the copy of the admitted complaint which is to be served, after which the Further, Regulation 10 of the Consumer Protection Regulations, 2005 also specifies the procedure of issuing notice, which should bealong with the notice, copies of the complaint, memorandum of grounds of appeal, petitions as the case may be and other NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 462 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. documents filed shall be served upon the opposite party(ies)/espondent(s)”.The same would also make it clear that it is on service of a copy of the complaint that the period of limitation for filing the 38. Even in the Code of Civil Procedure, Order VIII Rule 1 prescribes that the written statement shall be filed by the defendantNahar Enterprises vs Hyderabad Allwyn Ltd. (2007) 9 SCC 466 has, in paragraph 8, 9 and 10, held as under: (8) The learned counsel appears to be correct. When a summons is sent calling upon a defendant to appear in theeto, in terms of Order 5 Rule 2 CPC. (9) Order 5 Rule 2 CPC reads as under: “2. Copy of plaint annexed to summons. – Every summon shall The learned Judge did not address itself the question as to how a defendant, in absence of a copy of the plaint and Even in Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, sub-Section (5) of Section 31 provides that “after the arbitral award is made, a signed copy shall be delivered to each party”. An application for setting aside the arbitral award is to be made under Section 34 of theAct. The delivery of the award sets in motion the limitation for challenging the award under Section 34 of the said Act. While interpreting the nature and scope of Section 31(5) of the said Act, a three Judge Bench of this Court in Union of India vs Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors, (2005) 4 SCC 239, has, in paragraph 6, held as under: (6) Form and contents of the arbitral award are provided by Section 31 of the Act. The arbitral award drawn up in the A B D E F G H 463 manner prescribed by Section 31 of the Act has to be signed and dated. According to sub-section (5), “after the arbitral award is made, a signed copy shall be delivered to each party”. The term “party” is defined by clause (h) of Section 2 of thety to an arbitration agreement”. The definition is to be read as given unless the context otherwise requires. Under sub-section (3) of Section 34 the limitation of 3 months commences from the date on which “the party making that application” had received the arbitral award. ……………” provided, either for filing response/written statement or filing an appeal, 40. Now reverting to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, a conjoint reading of Clauses (a) and (b) of sub-Section (2) of, he would not be in a position to furnish its reply. Thus, mere service of notice, without service of the copy of the complaint, would not suffice and cannotWe may, however, clarify that the objection of not having received a copy of the complaint along with the notice should be raised on the, otherwise if permitted to be raised at any point later would defeat the very purpose of the Act, which is to provide simple and speedy redressal of consumer disputes. 41. To conclude, we hold that our answer to the first question is that the District Forum has no power to extend the time for filing theAct; and the answer to the second question is that the commencing point of limitation of 30 days under Section 13 of the NEW INDIA ASSURANCE CO. LTD. v. HILLI MULTIPURPOSE COLD STORAGE PVT. LTD. [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 464 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2020] 5 S.C.R. Consumer Protection Act would be from the date of receipt of the notice accompanied with the complaint by the opposite party, and not mere receipt of the notice of the complaint.
