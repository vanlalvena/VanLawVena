Leave granted in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.36324 of 2017 2. In State of Uttaranchal vs. Sandeep Kumar Singh and others1 [Civil   Appeal   No.4494   of   2006)   the   following   question   arose   for consideration of this Court: “Whether a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste in relation to a particular State would be entitled or not,   to   the   benefits   or   concessions   allowed   to 1 (2010) 12 SCC 794 2 Scheduled   Caste   candidate   in   the   matter   of employment, in any other State?”  3. In the course of the deliberations that took place this Court noticed   the   Constitution   Bench   judgments   of   this   Court   in  Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao vs. Dean, Seth G.S. Medical College and others2 and Action Committee on Issue of Caste Certificate to Scheduled Castes and   Scheduled   Tribes   in   the   State   of   Maharashtra   and   another  vs. Union of India and another3.   The view of a three Judge Bench of this Court in S. Pushpa and others vs. Sivachanmugavelu and others4   was also noticed and the same was perceived to be somewhat contrary to the view expressed by the Constitution Bench in the above two cases. This Court also took note of the fact that a two judge Bench of this Court in Subhash Chandra and another vs. Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board and others5 held that the dicta in S. Pushpa (supra) is an obiter and does not lay down any binding ratio.  The Bench hearing the case i.e. State of Uttaranchal vs. Sandeep Kumar Singh and others (supra) took the view that “it was not open to a two judge Bench to say that the decision of a three judge Bench rendered following 2 (1990) 3 SCC 130 3 (1994) 5 SCC 244 4 (2005) 3 SCC 1 5 (2009) 15 SCC 458 3 the  Constitution   Bench  judgments   to  be   per   incuriam”.    In this regard, the canons of judicial discipline carved out by this Court in Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community and another  vs. State of Maharashtra and another6  were recalled and eventually in paragraph 13 of the opinion rendered in State of Uttaranchal vs. Sandeep Kumar Singh   and   others   (supra)   the   reference  of  the   question   noted   below was made to a larger Bench: “13.  A   very   important   question   of   law   as   to interpretation of Articles 16(4), 341 and 342 arises for   consideration   in   this   appeal.   Whether   the Presidential   Order   issued   under   Article   341(1)   or Article 342(1) of the Constitution has any bearing on   the   State’s   action   in   making   provision   for   the reservation   of   appointments   or   posts   in   favour   of any   Backward   Class   of   citizens   which,   in   the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in   the   services   under   the   State?   The   extent   and nature of interplay and interaction among Articles 16(4),   341(1)   and   342(1)   of   the   Constitution   is required to be resolved.” 4. The said Civil Appeal No.4494 of 2006 (State of Uttaranchal vs.  Sandeep Kumar Singh and others) was disposed of by the larger Bench of this Court by order dated 6th August, 2014, in the light of the findings of the High Court recorded in paragraph 4 of the High Court 6 (2005) 2 SCC 673 4 order to the effect that the order impugned suffers from an apparent illegality  as  the   appointing  authority   of  the  petitioner  therein  is  the University   and   the   University   had   acted   at   the   dictate   of   the   State Government,   which   has   no   power   to   ask   for   cancellation   of   an appointment   made   in   accordance   with   the   advertisement.     In   the aforesaid order dated 6th  August, 2014 this Court took the view that the   conclusions   recorded   in   paragraph   4   of   the   High   Court   order cannot   be  said  to   be  legally   flawed   and   accordingly   closed  the   said Civil Appeal (No. 4494 of 2006) on the aforesaid basis.  The question referred was not answered.   5. However, the question arising and referred to in the State of Uttaranchal vs. Sandeep Kumar Singh and others (supra) was felt to be surviving and subsisting in the present appeals also.  Accordingly, by an order of the Court dated 7th August, 2014, the very same question as formulated in paragraph 13 of the judgment in State of Uttaranchal vs. Sandeep Kumar Singh and others (supra), as extracted above, has been referred for an answer by a five judge Bench of this Court.  That is how we are in seisin of the matters.  6. The factual matrix need not detain us and a brief resume 5 will suffice.   The question as to whether a policy in furtherance of the enabling   provision   contained   in   Article   16(4)   of   the   Constitution   of India could extend to giving of benefits beyond the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of a State/Union Territory enumerated in the Presidential Orders framed/issued under Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India had arisen in the bunch of writ petitions filed before the High Court of Delhi against the order/orders of the Central Administrative   Tribunal.     The   learned   Tribunal   following   Marri Chandra   Shekhar   Rao  (supra)   and     Action   Committee  (supra),   in preference   to   the   view   expressed   in  S.   Pushpa  (supra)   (three   judge Bench) held that insofar as the Union Territory of Delhi is concerned, a   migrant   Scheduled   Caste   person   would   not   be   entitled   to   the benefits conferred on members of the Scheduled Castes enumerated in the list for the Union Territory of Delhi by the Presidential Order (i.e. the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Lists (Modification) Order, 1956)   in   question.     The   Delhi   High   Court   sitting   in   a   Full   Bench (perhaps in view of the importance of the question) found the decision in S. Pushpa (supra) to be more directly relatable to the issue at hand i.e. being one of services in the Union Territory and, therefore, felt to 6 be bound by the decision of the three judge Bench of this Court in S. Pushpa (supra).  While doing so, the Delhi High court in paragraph 66 of   the   judgment   emphasised   on   the   necessity   of   an   authoritative pronouncement   on   the   issue(s)   arising.     Accordingly,   certificate   to appeal   under   Article   134­A   of   the   Constitution   was   granted   by   the High Court. Paragraph 66 of the judgment of the Full Bench of the Delhi   High   Court   will   require   a   specific   notice   and   is,   therefore, reproduced below: “66.   This   court   summarizes   its   conclusions,   as follows:   (1)   The   decisions   in   Marri,   Action Committee,   Milind   and   Channaiah   have   all   ruled that scheduled caste and tribe citizens moving from one   State   to   another   cannot   claim   reservation benefits, whether or not their caste is notified in the state   where   they   migrate   to,   since   the   exercise   of notifying scheduled castes or tribes is region (state) specific, i.e \" in relation\" to the state of their origin. These judgments also took note of the Presidential Notifications,  which  had  enjoined  such  citizens  to be   \"residents\"   in   relation   to   the   state   which provided for such reservations. (2)   The   considerations   which   apply   to   Scheduled Caste and Tribe citizens who migrate from state to state, apply equally in respect of those who migrate from a state to a union territory, in view of the text of Articles 341 (1) and 342 (1), i.e. only those castes and   tribes   who   are   notified   in   relation   to   the concerned   Union   Territory,   are   entitled   to   such benefits.   This   is   reinforced   by   the   Presidential Notification in relation to Union Territories, of 1951. 7 Only Parliament can add to such notification, and include   other  castes,   or   tribes,   in   view  of   Articles 341   (2),   Article   342(2)   which   is   also   reinforced by Article   16(3).    States   cannot   legislate   on   this aspect; nor can the executive ­ Union or state, add to or alter the castes, or tribes in any notification in relation to a state or Union Territory, either through state   legislation   or   through   policies   or   circulars. Differentiation   between   residents   of   states,   who migrate   to   states,   and   residents   of   states   who migrate   to   Union   Territories   would   result   in invidious   discrimination   and   over­classification thus denying equal access to reservation benefits, to those who are residents of Union Territories, and whose   castes   or   tribes   are   included   in   the Presidential   Order   in   respect   of   such   Union Territories.   The   Pushpa   interpretation   has   led   to peculiar consequences, whereby: (i) The resident of a state, belonging to a scheduled caste,   notified   in   that   state,   cannot   claim reservation   benefit,   if   he   takes   up   residence   in another state, whether or not his caste is included in the latter State's list of scheduled castes; (ii) However, the resident of a state who moves to a Union   Territory   would   be   entitled   to   carry   his reservation   benefit,   and   status   as   member   of scheduled caste, even if his caste is not included as a scheduled caste, for that Union Territory; (iii)   The   resident   of   a   Union   Territory   would however, be denied the benefit of reservation, if he moves   to   a   State,   because   he   is   not   a   resident scheduled caste of that State. (iv)   The   resident   of   a   Union   Territory   which   later becomes   a   State,   however,   can   insist   that   after such event, residents of other states, whose castes 8 may  or   may  not   be   notified,   as   scheduled   castes, cannot be treated as such members in such newly formed states; (v)   Conversely,   the   scheduled   caste   resident   of   a state   which   is   converted   into   a   Union   Territory, cannot protest against the treatment of scheduled caste   residents   of   other   states   as   members   of scheduled caste of the Union Territory, even though their   castes   are   not   included   in   the   list   of   such castes, for the Union Territory. (3) The ruling in Pushpa is clear that if the resident of   a   state,   whose   caste   is   notified   as   Scheduled caste   or   scheduled   tribe,   moves   to   a   Union Territory, he carries with him the right to claim that benefit,   in   relation   to   the   Union   Territory,   even though if he moves to another state, he is denied such benefit (as a result of the rulings in Marri and Action   Committee).   The   ruling   in   Pushpa,   being specific   about   this   aspect   vis­à­vis   Union Territories, is binding; it was rendered by a Bench of   three   judges.   (4)   The   later   ruling   in   Subhash Chandra doubted the judgment in Pushpa, holding that it did not appreciate the earlier larger Bench judgments in the correct perspective. Yet, Subhash Chandra cannot be said to have overruled Pushpa, since   it   was   rendered   by   a   smaller   Bench   of   two judges.   This   approach   of   Subhash   Chandra   has been   doubted,   and   the   question   as   to  the   correct view has been referred to a Constitution Bench in the State of Uttaranchal case. (5) By virtue of the specific ruling applicable in the case of Union Territories, in Pushpa, whatever may be the doubts entertained as to the soundness of its reasoning, the High Courts have to apply its ratio, as   it   is   by   a   formation   of   three   judges;   the   said decision did notice the earlier judgments in Marri 9 and   Action   Committee.   Article   141   and   the discipline   enjoined   by   the   doctrine   of   precedent compels this Court to follow the Pushpa ruling. (6)   In   matters   pertaining   to   incidence   of employment,   such   as   seniority,   promotion   and accelerated   seniority   or   promotional   benefits, flowing   out   of   Articles   16   (4A)   and   (4B)   of   the Constitution,   there   may   be   need   for   clarity, whichever   rule   is   ultimately   preferred   ­   i.e   the Pushpa   view   or   the   Marri   and   Action   Committee view.   In   such   event,   it   may   be   necessary   for   the guidance   of   decision   makers   and   High   Courts,   to spell out whether the correct view should be applied prospectively.   Furthermore,   it   may   be   also necessary   to   clarify   what   would   be   meant   by prospective   application   of   the   correct   rule,   and whether   such   employment   benefits   flowing   after recruitment, would be altered if the Marri view is to be preferred.” 7. Civil Appeal Nos.9935­9937 of 2014 from the decision of the Calcutta High court pertain to claims made by persons belonging to Uraons and Mundas members of the Scheduled Tribes communities who   have   migrated   to   the   Union   Territory   of   Andaman   &   Nicobar Island.  The High Court rejected the claim of reservation made by the aforesaid   migrants   Scheduled   Tribes   communities   confining   such benefits to the Scheduled Castes communities enumerated in the list appearing in the Presidential Order pertaining to the Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Island.  10 8. Before   delving   into   the   constitutional   provisions   which would be necessary to be dealt with for answering the reference a brief look   at   the   pre­constitutional   position   on   the   issue   would   throw considerable   light   and   provide   a   sound   insight   to   the   multi­faceted questions that the reference has given rise to.  9. The caste system in India, which is the bane of a just social order, has a long history which can be traced to the earliest times. Ancient   Hindu   religious   scriptures   refer   to   the   practice.   Division   of Society   based   on   birth   and   the   calling/profession   of   a   person   has continued to dominate Hindu thinking and way of life and is perhaps one   of   the   thorny   problems   inherited   by   the   British   Administration which had tried to resolve the same by giving legal recognition to what came to be termed as the “depressed classes”.  Such recognition was in the form of a protective regime which extended to representation in the   Legislature   and   in   the   services   under   the   State.     Exercises   in finding out the numerical strength of the depressed class in the early 20th  Century   (By   Southborough   Committee)   revealed   a   grim   picture indicating such number to be as high as 20 per cent of the majority population (Hindu) in eight (08) Indian Provinces of Madras, Bombay, 11 Bengal, United Provinces, Punjab, Bihar and Orissa, Central Provinces and Assam.   The above figure did not include primitive or aboriginal tribes   who   later   came   to   be   known   as   the   Scheduled   Tribes   and included   in   the   list   of   Scheduled   Tribes   under   the   different Presidential Orders issued from time to time. 10. The Government of India Act, 1935 (hereinafter referred to as “1935 Act”) (also referred to as “the Constitution Act”) brought into force  the   expression   “Scheduled   Castes”  for   the  first  time  in   Indian Constitutional history.   Entry 26 Part I of the First Schedule to the 1935 Act stipulates that “the Scheduled Castes mean such castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within the castes, races or tribes, being castes, races, tribes, parts or groups, which appear to His Majesty in Council to correspond to the classes of persons formerly   known   as   ‘the   depressed   classes’,   as   His   Majesty   in Council may specify”.  11. Thereafter a Gazette Notification was published on 6th June, 1936 promulgating the Government of India (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1936   notifying   the   list   of   castes   that   are   to   be   considered   as   “the 12 Scheduled   Castes”   across   the   territory   of   India.     A   look   at   the Schedule   which   consisted   of   nine   (09)   parts   i.e.   Madras,   Bombay, Bengal,   United   Provinces,   Punjab,   Bihar,   Central   Provinces,   Assam, Orissa   would   indicate   that   identification   of   the   different   castes   for inclusion as Scheduled Castes in the Schedule to the 1935 Act was based on an elaborate exercise conducted for each of the Provinces so much   so   that   while   some   castes   have   been   identified   as  Scheduled Castes throughout a Province, others have been so identified to limited areas   within   a   province.     The   post   constitutional   exercise   by   the Constitution   (Scheduled   Castes)   Order,   1950   and   the   Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950, as originally enacted under Articles 341   and   342   of   the   Constitution,   was   basically   an   exercise   in   re­ casting the Schedule to the 1935 Act.  The subsequent amendments to the aforesaid two Orders, from time to time, have been necessitated to bring the position in tune with the amendments to the First Schedule to the Constitution made at different points of time by creation of new States and alterations in the area and boundaries of existing States.   12. Article   366   of   the   Constitution   which   defines   expressions appearing in the Constitution specifically  defines ‘Scheduled Castes’ 13 [clause (24)] to mean “such castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within such castes, races or tribes as are deemed under Article   341   to   be   Scheduled   Castes   for   the   purposes   of   this Constitution”. Similarly, clause (25) of Article 366 defines “Scheduled Tribes” to mean “such tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of this Constitution”. 13. Part   XVI   of   the   Constitution   of   India   deals   with   special provisions   relating   to   certain   classes.     Article   330   provides   for reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the House of the People (Lok Sabha) whereas Article 332 contains similar provisions   so   far   as   the   Legislative   Assemblies   of   the   States   are concerned.  Article 335 of the Constitution provides that “the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall   be   taken   into   consideration,   consistently   with   the maintenance   of   efficiency   of   administration,   in   the   making   of appointments   to   services   and   posts   in   connection   with   the 14 affairs of the Union or of a State”.   By the Constitution (Eighty­ Second) Amendment Act, 2000 a proviso to Article 335 was added to provide   that   the   members   of   the   Scheduled   Castes   and   Scheduled Tribes   may   be   granted   relaxation   in   qualifying   marks   in   any examination or standards of evaluation can be lowered in matters of promotion to any class or classes of services or posts in connection with   the   affairs   of   the   Union   or   of   a   State.   Article   338   of   the Constitution provides for a National Commission for Scheduled Cates which is invested with the following duties: “(a) to investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguards provided for the Scheduled Castes under this Constitution or under any other law for the time being in force or  under any order of the Government   and   to   evaluate   the   working   of   such safeguards;  (b) to inquire into specific complaints with respect to  the  deprivation of  rights  and  safeguards  of the Scheduled Castes;  (c)   to   participate   and   advise   on   the   planning process   of   socio­economic   development   of   the Scheduled  Castes  and  to  evaluate  the  progress  of their development under the Union and any State; the Scheduled Castes and to evaluate the progress of   their   development   under   the   Union   and   any State; (d)   to   present   to   the   President,   annually   and   at such other times as the Commission may deem fit, 15 reports upon the working of those safeguards; deem fit, reports upon the working of those safeguards; (e) to make in such reports recommendations as to the measures that should be taken by the Union or any State for the effective implementation of those safeguards and other measures for the protection, welfare   and   socio­economic   development   of   the Scheduled Castes; and  (f) to discharge such other functions in relation to the   protection,   welfare   and   development   and advancement   of   the   Scheduled   Castes   as   the President may, subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, by the rule specify.” 14. Similarly, Article 338A provides for a National Commission for Scheduled Tribes which is vested with similar duties as in the case of the Commission for the Scheduled Castes. 15. Article   341(1)   of   the   Constitution   empowers   the   President with respect to any State or Union Territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification, to specify the castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within castes, races   or   tribes   which   shall   for   the   purposes   of   the   Constitution   be deemed   to   be   Scheduled   Castes   in   relation   to   that   State   or   Union 16 Territory, as the case may be.  16. In case of Scheduled Tribes the President has been similarly empowered under Article 342(1) of the Constitution.  Sub­clause (2) of Article 341 and Article 342 empowers the Parliament by law to include in   or   exclude   from   the   list   of   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes specified in the Notification issued under clause (1) thereof any caste, race or tribe/tribal community or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe/tribal community. It is further provided that except as provided   i.e.   by   Parliament   by   law(s)   made,   the   notification   issued under   Article   341(1)   or   Article   342(1)   shall   not   be   varied   by   any subsequent   notification.       The   constitutional   mandate,   therefore, appears to be that any caste, race or tribe/tribal community or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe/tribal community as has been specified in the Presidential Order under clause (1) of Article 341 or Article 342 can be altered only by Parliament by law(s) made. 17. Article   341   and   Article   342   also   makes   it   clear   that   the caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe as specified in the Presidential Order under Article 341(1) or a tribe or tribal community as may be specified in the Presidential Order under 17 Article   342(1)   shall   be   deemed   to   be   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of the Constitution in relation to that State or Union Territory, as the case may be.   The above position is further made clear by clause (2) of the two Presidential Orders which are in the following terms. “Clause   2   of   the   Constitution   (Scheduled   Castes) Order, 1950 2. Subject to the provisions of this Order, the castes, races or tribes or parts of, or groups within, castes or tribes specified in Parts I to XXV of the Schedule to this   Order   shall,   in   relation   to   the   States   to   which those   Parts   respectively   relate,   be   deemed   to   be Scheduled Castes so far as regards member  thereof resident in the localities specified in relation to them in those Parts of that Schedule. Clause   2   of   the   Constitution   (Scheduled   Tribes) Order, 1950 2.  The   Tribes  or   tribal  communities,  or   parts   of,  or groups within, tribes or tribal communities, specified in Parts I to XXII of the Schedule to this Order shall, in   relation   to   the   States   to   which   those   Parts respectively relate, be deemed to be Scheduled Tribes so   far   as   regards   members   thereof   residents   in   the localities specified in relation to them respectively in those Parts of that Schedule.” 18. There   are   various   parameters   by   which   a   caste/race   is recognized   as   'Scheduled   Caste/Scheduled   Tribe'  in   a   State/Union Territory or a particular part thereof.   There is no doubt that before 18 the   Presidential   Orders   were   issued   under   Article   341(1)   or   under Article   342(1),   elaborate   enquiries   were   made   and   only   after   such enquiries that the Presidential Orders were issued. While doing so, the Presidential   Orders   not   only   provided   that   even   specified   parts   or groups of castes, races or tribes/tribal community could be Scheduled Castes/Tribes in a particular State/Union Territory but also made it clear   that   certain   castes   or   tribes   or   parts/groups   thereof   could   be Scheduled Castes/Tribes only in specified/particular areas/districts of a State/Union Territory.  The reason for such an exercise by reference to specific areas of a State is that judged by standards of educational, social backwardness, etc. races or tribes may not stand on the same footing   throughout   the   State.   The   consideration   for   specifying   a particular caste or tribe or class for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes or Backward Classes in any given State depends   on   the   nature   and   extent   of   the   disadvantages   and   social hardships   suffered   by   the   concerned   members   of   the   class   in   that State.   These   may   be   absent   in   another   State   to   which   the   persons belonging to some other State may migrate. 19. The   Presidential   Orders   which   enumerate   lists   of 19 castes/races, tribes recognized as 'Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe' cannot be challenged or agitated in a court of law except, perhaps, on the limited ground as held in M. Nagaraj and others vs. Union of India and others7.  A few illustrations may clarify the position.  The question whether  Dohar  caste   is   a   sub­caste   of  Chamar  caste   which   is recognized as a scheduled caste came up for consideration in Bhaiya Lal   vs.   Harikishan   Singh8.   This   Court   held   that   the   court   cannot enquire into whether Dohar caste is a sub­caste of Chamar caste and whether   the   same   must   be   deemed   to   have   been   included   in   the Presidential Order.  In Bhaiya Lal  (supra), this Court held that before issuing notifications under Articles 341 and 342, an elaborate enquiry is made and as a result of the enquiry social justice is sought to be done to the castes, races or tribes as may appear to be necessary.  It was   further   held   that   only   Parliament   is   empowered   to   amend   the Notification under Articles 341(2) and 342(2) of the Constitution, as is underlined by the expression \"but save as aforesaid a notification issued   under   the   said   clause   shall   not   be   varied   by   any subsequent notification\" occurring in each of the said provisions. In 7 (2006) 8 SCC 212 8 AIR 1965 SC 1557 20 Bhaiya Lal (supra), this Court held as under:­ \"10...The object of Article 341(1) plainly is to provide additional protection to the members of the Scheduled Castes having regard to the economic and educational backwardness   from   which   they   suffer.   It   is   obvious that in specifying castes, races or tribes, the President has been expressly authorised to limit the notification to parts of or groups within the castes, races or tribes, and   that   must   mean   that   after   examining   the educational and social backwardness of a caste, race or tribe, the President may well come to the conclusion that not the whole caste, race or tribe but parts of or groups within them should be specified. Similarly, the President can specify castes, races or tribes or parts thereof in relation not only to the entire State, but in relation to parts of the State where he is satisfied that the   examination   of   the   social   and   educational   are backwardness of the race, caste or tribe justifies such specification.  In   fact,   it   is   well   known   that   before   a notification is issued under Article 341(1), an elaborate enquiry is made and it is as a result of this enquiry that social justice is sought to be done to the castes, races or tribes as may appear to be necessary, and in doing justice, it would obviously be expedient not only to specify parts or groups of castes, races or tribes, but to make the said specification by reference to different areas   in   the   State.   Educational   and   social backwardness in regard to these castes, races or tribes may   not   be   uniform   or   of   the   same   intensity   in   the whole of the State; it may vary in degree or in kind in different areas and that may justify the division of the State   into   convenient   and   suitable   areas   for   the purpose   of   issuing   the   public   notification   in question...\"  [Underlining added] 21 20. Whenever States' reorganization had taken place in the past,  Parliament   had  exercised   its  powers  under   Article  341(2) and  Article 342(2)  and provided for  specific Castes/Tribes that were   entitled   to   be   recognised   as   Scheduled   Castes   and Scheduled   Tribes   in   relation   to   the   reorganized   States/Union Territories. The Scheme of  the  Constitution (Scheduled Castes) and (Scheduled Tribes) Orders makes it clear that Parliament's intention was to extend the benefits of reservation in relation to the States/Union Territories only to the castes, races or tribes as mentioned in the Presidential Orders. 21. The Orders of 1950 was amended by the Constitution (Scheduled   Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes   Order),   by   the Amendment   Act,   1956   (Act   63/1956).     Another   amending   Act was   enacted  by   parliament   in   1976.    Earlier,   orders  had   been made for the first time in relation to certain territories, such as the   Constitution   (Andaman   and   Nicobar   Islands)   Scheduled Tribes Order, 1959.   Further, amendments had taken place as and   when   parliament   reorganized   states,   through   separate 22 Reorganisation Acts, which led to large scale modification of the Presidential   Orders.   Illustratively,   when   new   States/Union Territories   were   formed   such   as,   Nagaland,   Pondicherry,   or Sikkim, the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes Orders were made   in   relation   to   the   new   States/Union   Territories,   for instance,   the   Constitution   (Nagaland)   Scheduled   Tribes   Order, 1970­   after   the   reorganisation   of   Assam;   the   Constitution (Sikkim)   Scheduled   Castes   Order,   1978;   the   Constitution (Sikkim)   Scheduled   Tribes   Order,   1978)   upon   creation   of   the State of Sikkim; the recent ones being upon creation of the States of  Uttarakhand,   Chhattisgarh,   and   Jharkhand.   Likewise,   when previous Union Territories (such as Goa, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh)   were   constituted   into   States,   consequential amendments   were   made   to   the   Scheduled   Castes   and   Tribes Orders.     All   such   amendments/enactments   were   made   by Parliament.   22. Though   in   a   different   context   i.e.   in   relation   to Backward Classes this Court in  M.C.D. v. Veena and Ors.9, has specifically held that migrants are not entitled for reservation as 9 (2001) 6 SCC 571 23 Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the States/Union Territories where they have migrated.  The relevant portion of the judgment that may be noticed is as hereunder:­ \"6. Castes or groups are specified in relation to a given State or Union Territory, which obviously means   that   such   caste   would   include   caste belonging   to   an   OBC   group  in   relation   to   that State or Union Territory for which it is specified. The   matters   that   are   to   be   taken   into consideration for specifying a particular caste in a   particular   group   belonging   to   OBCs   would depend   on   the   nature   and   extent   of disadvantages and social hardships suffered by that   caste   or   group   in   that   State.   However,   it may   not   be   so   in   another   State   to   which   a person   belonging   thereto   goes   by   migration.   It may also be that a caste belonging to the same nomenclature is specified in two States but the considerations  on   the  basis  of  which  they  had been   specified   may   be   totally   different.   So   the degree   of   disadvantages   of   various   elements which constitute the data for specification may also be entirely different. Thus, merely because a   given   caste   is   specified   in   one   State   as belonging   to   OBCs   does   not   necessarily   mean that if there be another group belonging to the same nomenclature in another State, a person belonging to that group is entitled to the rights, privileges   and   benefits   admissible   to   the members of that caste. These aspects have to be borne in mind in interpreting the provisions of the Constitution with reference to application of reservation to OBCs.\" 23. A Constitution Bench of this Court in  Marri Chandra 24 Shekhar Rao (supra) had the occasion to consider the question as to   whether   a   member   of   the   Gouda   community   which   is recognised as “Scheduled  Tribe” in the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes)  Order,  1950 for  the  State of  Andhra  Pradesh  would be entitled   to   admission   in   a   medical   institution   situated   in   the State of Maharashtra. This Court noticed the fact that the father of the petitioner in  Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao (supra)  was an employee   in   Fertilizer   Corporation   of   India,   a   public   sector undertaking   and   thereafter   in   Rashtriya   Chemicals   and Fertilizers   Limited,   a   Government   of   India   undertaking.     He belonged to the Gouda community, a recognized Scheduled Tribe of   Andhra   Pradesh.     On   his   appointment   he   was   stationed   at Bombay. The petitioner came to Bombay at the age of nine years. He   completed   his   studies   in   Bombay;   he   submitted   an application for his admission in the medical institutions run by Bombay Municipal Corporation which was denied.  This denial of admission was based on the Government of India circular dated 22nd  February, 1985, according to which a person who migrates from   one   State   to   another   is   entitled   to   the   benefit   of   being Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in the State of origin and not 25 in the State to which he or she migrates. The appellant was held not entitled to be admitted to the Medical College on the basis that he belonged to a Scheduled Tribe in his original State i.e. Andhra Pradesh.   24. After referring to various provisions of the Constitution of India, the background in which the Presidential Orders were issued and several earlier judgments of this Court, it was held as under:­ \"9.  It   appears   that   Scheduled   Castes   and Scheduled  Tribes in  some  States  had to suffer the   social   disadvantages   and   did   not   have   the facilities   for   development   and   growth.   It   is, therefore,   necessary   in   order   to   make   them equal in those areas where they have so suffered and   are   in   the   state   of   underdevelopment   to have reservations or protection in their favour so that they can compete on equal terms with the more advantageous or developed sections of the community.   Extreme   social   and   economic backwardness arising out of traditional practices of   untouchability   is   normally   considered   as criterion for including a community in the list of Scheduled   Castes   and   Scheduled   Tribes.  The social conditions of a caste, however, varies from State   to   State   and   it   will   not   be   proper   to generalise any caste or any tribe as a Scheduled Tribe or Scheduled Caste for the whole country. This, however, is a different problem whether a member or the Scheduled Caste in one part of the   country   who   migrates   to   another   State   or 26 any other Union territory should continue to be treated as a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in which he has migrated. That question has to be judged taking into consideration the interest and   well­being   of   the   Scheduled   Castes   and Scheduled Tribes in the country as a whole.\" [underlining is ours] 25. In  Marri   Chandra   Shekhar   Rao   (supra),  rejecting   the contention that a member of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes should   get   the   benefit   of   the   status   'for   the   purpose   of   the Constitution   throughout   the   territory   of   India',   it   was observed that if such contention is to be accepted the expression \"In relation of that State\" would become nugatory.  26. Marri   Chandra   Shekhar   Rao  (supra)  was   followed   by another   Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court   in  Action   Committee (supra).  After referring to Articles 14, 15(1), 15(4), 16(4) and 19 and   Part   XVI   of   the   Constitution   of   India   and   the   decisions governing the field and also Articles 341 and 342, it was held as under:­ \"3. On a plain reading of clause (1) of Articles 341 and   342   it   is   manifest   that   the   power   of   the President   is   limited   to   specifying   the   castes   or 27 tribes   which   shall,   for   the   purposes   of   the Constitution, be deemed to be Scheduled Castes or   Scheduled   Tribes   in   relation   to   a   State   or   a Union   Territory,   as   the   case   may   be.   Once   a notification is issued under clause (1) of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution, Parliament can by   law   include   in   or   exclude   from   the   list   of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, specified in the notification, any caste or tribe but save for that limited purpose the notification issued under clause (1), shall not be varied by any subsequent notification. What  is important  to notice is that the   castes   or   tribes   have   to   be   specified   in relation to a given State or Union Territory. That means a given caste or tribe can be a Scheduled Caste   or   a   Scheduled   Tribe   in   relation   to   the State or Union Territory for which it is specified. These are the relevant provisions with which we shall   be   concerned   while   dealing   with   the grievance made in this petition. .... 16.  We   may   add   that   considerations   for specifying a particular caste or tribe or class for inclusion   in   the   list   of   Scheduled Castes/Schedule Tribes or backward classes in a given   State   would   depend   on   the   nature   and extent   of   disadvantages   and   social   hardships suffered by that caste, tribe or class in that State which may be totally non est in another State to which   persons   belonging   thereto   may   migrate. Coincidentally   it   may   be   that   a   caste   or   tribe bearing   the   same   nomenclature   is   specified   in two States but the considerations on the basis of which   they   have   been   specified   may   be   totally different. So also the degree of disadvantages of various  elements which  constitute  the  input  for specification   may   also   be   totally   different. Therefore,   merely   because   a   given   caste   is specified   in   State   A   as   a   Scheduled   Caste   does 28 not   necessarily   mean   that   if   there   be   another caste bearing the same nomenclature in another State the  person belonging   to  the former   would be entitled  to  the  rights, privileges and  benefits admissible to a member of the Scheduled Caste of   the   latter   State   “for   the   purposes   of   this Constitution”. This is an aspect which has to be kept   in   mind   and   which   was   very   much   in  the minds   of   the   Constitution­makers   as   is   evident from the choice of language of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution....\" [underlining is ours] 27. Marri   Chandra   Shekhar   Rao  (supra)  and  Action Committee  (supra)   were   followed   in  Subhash   Chandra   and another  (supra).     After   referring   to   various   judgments   on   the point   and   also   the   various   circulars,   this   Court   in  Subhash Chandra and another (supra) held as under:­ \"69.  Both the Central Government and the State Government indisputably may lay down a policy decision in regard to reservation having regard to Articles   15   and   16   of   the   Constitution   of   India but   such   a   policy   cannot   violate   other constitutional   provisions.   A   policy   cannot   have primacy over the constitutional scheme. If for the purposes   of   Articles   341   and   342   of   the Constitution   of   India,   State   and   the   Union Territory   are   on   a   par   on   the   ground   of administrative exigibility (sic) or in exercise of the administrative power, the constitutional interdict contained in clause (2) of Article 341 or clause (2) of Article 342 of the Constitution of India cannot 29 be got rid of. ....... 75.  If a caste or tribe is notified in terms of the Scheduled Castes Order or the Scheduled Tribes Order, the same must be done in terms of clause (1) of Article 341 as also that of Article 342 of the Constitution   of   India,   as   the   case   may   be.   No deviation from the procedure laid down therein is permissible in law. If any amendment/alteration thereto   is   required   to  be   made,   recourse   to  the procedure   laid   down   under   clause   (2)   thereof must be resorted to.\" 28. In  Marri   Chandra   Shekhar   Rao  (supra),  the Constitution Bench observed that the expression \"in relation to that   State\"  must   be   read   meaningfully   and   harmoniously.     It was observed that if a member of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes gets the benefit of that status throughout the territory of India, the expression \"in relation to that State\" would become nugatory.     If   the   special   privileges   or   the   rights   granted   to scheduled castes or scheduled tribes in a particular State are to be made available in all the States and if such benefits are to be carried from State ‘A’ to State ‘B’ on migration, the mandate of Article 341/342 would get compromised.   Such a consequence must be avoided for it is a fundamental rule of interpretation, be it of a statutory enactment or of the Constitution, that wherever 30 and   whenever   there   is   a   conflict   between   two   provisions,   the same   should   be   so   interpreted   as   to   give   effect   to   both. “…….Nothing is surplus in a Constitution and no part should be made nugatory…..”. [Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao (supra)] 29. The issue has to be viewed from another perspective. If a member of a Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled Tribe of Andhra Pradesh   who   had   migrated   to   Maharashtra   is   to   be   given   the benefit of reservation it will amount to depriving a member of a Scheduled   Caste/Scheduled   Tribe   of   Maharashtra   by   reducing the reservation earmarked for them.  It is in this context, in Marri Chandra   Shekhar   Rao   (supra),  that  the   Constitution   Bench observed as under:­ \"14.  ....But   having   regard   to   the   purpose,   it appears   to   us   that   harmonious   construction enjoins   that   we   should   give   to   each   expression —”in relation to that State” or “for the purposes of this Constitution” — its full meaning and give their full effect. This must be so construed that one must not negate the other. The construction that reservation made in respect of the Scheduled Caste or Tribe of that State is so determined to be entitled to all the privileges and rights under the Constitution   in   that   State   would   be   the   most correct   way   of   reading,   consistent   with   the 31 language,   purpose   and   scheme   of   the Constitution. Otherwise, one has to bear in mind that  if  reservations  to those who  are  treated  as Scheduled Caste or Tribe in Andhra Pradesh are also   given   to   a   boy   or   a   girl   who   migrates   and gets   deducted   (sic  inducted)   in   the   State   of Maharashtra or other States where that caste or tribe   is   not   treated   as   Scheduled   Caste   or Scheduled Tribe then either reservation will have the   effect   of   depriving   the   percentage   to   the member   of   that   caste   or   tribe   in   Maharashtra who would  be entitled to  protection or  it would denude the other non­Scheduled Castes or non­ Scheduled   Tribes   in   Maharashtra   to   the proportion that they are entitled to. This cannot be   logical   or   correct   result   designed   by   the Constitution.\" 30. Unhesitatingly, therefore, it can be said that a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste in one State cannot be deemed to be  a  Scheduled  Caste  person  in  relation   to  any  other  State  to which he migrates for the purpose of employment or education. The expressions \"in relation to that State or Union Territory\" and \"for the purpose of this Constitution\" used in Articles 341 and   342   of   the   Constitution   of   India   would   mean   that   the benefits   of   reservation   provided   for   by   the   Constitution   would stand   confined  to  the   geographical  territories  of  a  State/Union Territory   in   respect   of   which   the   lists   of   Scheduled 32 Castes/Scheduled Tribes have been notified by the Presidential Orders   issued   from   time   to   time.     A   person   notified   as   a Scheduled   Caste   in   State   'A'   cannot   claim   the   same   status   in another State on the basis that he is declared as a Scheduled Caste in State 'A'.   31. In S. Pushpa (supra), the Pondicherry Government had appointed   Selection   Grade   Teachers   in   1995   under   the Scheduled   Castes   quota   from   amongst   the   scheduled   castes candidates   registered   in   the   employment   exchange   in Pondicherry   but   also   extended   the   benefit   of   reservation   to scheduled   castes   candidates   of   other   States   and   Union Territories.     The   Chennai   Bench   of   Central   Administrative Tribunal (“CAT” for short) quashed the selection process holding that   migrant   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   candidates could   not   be   considered   for   appointment   for   posts   within   the union territory of Pondicherry. In S. Pushpa (supra) the issue was with   regard   to  the   extent   of   benefit   that   Scheduled   Castes candidates of other States/Union Territories would be entitled to in Pondicherry.   This Court held that in the matter of providing 33 reservation, it was open to the Pondicherry Government to apply or   adopt   a   policy   to   give   the   benefit   of   reservation   to   migrant Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  In paragraphs 17 and 21 in S. Pushpa (supra), it was held as under: “17. We do not find anything inherently wrong or any infraction of any constitutional provision in such a policy. The principle enunciated in    Marri Chandra   Shekhar   Rao     cannot   have   application here   as   UT   of   Pondicherry   is   not   a   State.   As shown above, a Union Territory is administered by   the   President   through   an   Administrator appointed by him. In the context of Article 246, Union Territories are excluded from the ambit of the   expression   “State”   occurring   therein.   This was clearly explained by a Constitution Bench in T.M.   Kanniyan  v.  ITO.   In  New   Delhi   Municipal Council  v.  State   of   Punjab  the   majority   has approved   the   ratio   of  T.M.   Kanniyan  and   has held that the Union Territories are not States for the purpose of Part XI of the Constitution (para 145). The Tribunal  has, therefore, clearly  erred in applying the ratio of  Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao  in   setting   aside   the   selection   and appointment of migrant SC candidates. (underlining is ours) *** *** *** 21.  ....Article   16(4)   is   not   controlled   by   a Presidential Order issued under Article 341(1) or Article   342(1)   of   the   Constitution   in   the   sense that reservation in the matter of appointment on posts may be made in a State or Union Territory only for such Scheduled Castes and Scheduled 34 Tribes   which   are   mentioned   in   the   Schedule appended   to   the   Presidential   Order   for   that particular State or Union Territory. This article does not say that only such Scheduled Castes and   Scheduled   Tribes   which   are   mentioned   in the   Presidential   Order   issued   for   a   particular State   alone   would   be   recognised   as   backward classes of citizens and none else. If a State or Union Territory  makes a provision  whereunder the   benefit   of   reservation   is   extended   only   to such   Scheduled   Castes   or   Scheduled   Tribes which are recognised as such in relation to that State or Union Territory then such a provision would be perfectly  valid. However, there would be no infraction of clause (4) of Article 16 if a Union Territory by virtue of its peculiar position being governed by the President as laid down in Article   239   extends   the   benefit   of   reservation even   to   such   migrant   Scheduled   Castes   or Scheduled Tribes who are not mentioned in the Schedule   to   the   Presidential   Order   issued   for such   Union   Territory.   The   UT   of   Pondicherry having   adopted   a   policy   of   the   Central Government   whereunder   all   Scheduled   Castes or  Scheduled  Tribes,  irrespective of  their  State are   eligible   for   posts   which   are   reserved   for SC/ST   candidates,   no   legal   infirmity   can   be ascribed to such a policy and the same cannot be held to be contrary to any provision of law.\" 32. The upshot of the aforesaid discussion would lead us to   the   conclusion   that   the   Presidential   Orders   issued   under Article 341 in regard to Scheduled Castes and under Article 342 in regard to Scheduled Tribes cannot be varied or altered by any 35 authority including the Court.   It is the Parliament alone which has been vested with the power to so act, that too, by laws made. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes thus specified in relation to a State or a Union Territory does not carry the same status in another State or Union Territory.  Any expansion/deletion of the list   of   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   by   any   authority except Parliament would be against the constitutional mandate under Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India. 33. Article 16(4) is an enabling provision.   It enables the State to provide to backward classes including Scheduled Castes and   Scheduled   Tribes   reservation   in   appointments   to   public services.     Such   reservation   is   to   be   provided   on   the   basis   of quantifiable data indicating the adequacy or inadequacy, as may be, of the representation of such classes in Government service. The data which is the basis of the satisfaction of the State being verifiable,   is   open   to   judicial   scrutiny   on   the   limited   ground   of relevance   of   the   circumstances   on   which   the   satisfaction   is moulded.  The policy decision to provide reservation, of course, is beyond the pale of judicial review. 36 34. It is an unquestionable principle of interpretation that interrelated statutory as well as constitutional provisions have to be harmoniously construed and understood so as to avoid making any provision nugatory and redundant.   If the list of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in the Presidential Orders under Article 341/342 is subject to alteration only by laws made by Parliament, operation of the lists of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes beyond   the   classes   or   categories   enumerated   under   the Presidential   Order   for   a   particular   State/Union   Territory   by exercise of the enabling power vested by Article 16(4) would have the   obvious   effect   of   circumventing   the   specific   constitutional provisions  in  Articles  341/342.     In  this  regard,  it  must  also  be noted   that   the   power   under   Article  16(4)  is  not  only   capable  of being exercised by a legislative provision/enactment but also by an Executive Order issued under Article 166 of the Constitution. It will, therefore, be in consonance with the constitutional scheme to   understand   the   enabling   provision   under   Article   16(4)   to   be available to provide reservation only to the classes or categories of Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   enumerated   in   the 37 Presidential  orders  for   a  particular  State/Union  Territory  within the   geographical   area   of   that   State   and   not   beyond.     If   in   the opinion   of   a   State   it   is   necessary   to   extend   the   benefit   of reservation   to   a   class/category   of   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled Tribes beyond those specified in the Lists for that particular State, constitutional discipline would require the State to make its views in the matter prevail with the central authority so as to enable an appropriate parliamentary exercise to be made by an amendment of   the   Lists   of   Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   for   that particular State.  Unilateral action by States on the touchstone of Article 16(4) of the Constitution could be a possible trigger point of constitutional   anarchy   and   therefore   must   be   held   to   be impermissible under the Constitution. 35. The decision in  S. Pushpa  (supra) may now be taken up   to   understand   the   basis   on   which   the   conclusion   recorded therein was recorded. In S. Pushpa (supra) a distinction was found by this Court in the constitutional status of a Union Territory and a   State   in   relation   to   the   Union/Central   Government.       The provisions   of   Article   239   and   239A   of   the   Constitution;   Section 38 3(8)   of   the   General   Clauses   Act,   1897   defining   ‘Central Government’   and   the   provisions   of   the   Government   of   Union Territories   Act,   1963   were   considered   to   arrive   at   the   following conclusion: “14.  The effect of these provisions is also that the Administrator (Lt Governor of Pondicherry) and   his   Council   of   Ministers   act   under   the general control of and are under an obligation to comply with any particular direction issued by   the   President.   Further,   the   Administrator (Lt   Governor   of   Pondicherry)   while   acting under the scope of the authority given to him under Article 239 of the Constitution would be the Central Government.” 36.  It   is   on   the   aforesaid   basis   that   the   concerned Notification/Government   Order   dated   16th  February,   1974   by which it was provided that Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates   from   outside   the   Union   Territory   of   Pondicherry should also be considered for appointment to posts reserved for Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled   Tribes   in   the   Union   Territory Administration   and   the   communication   of   the   Government   of India dated 6th October, 1995 to the same effect were upheld.   37. The   First   Schedule   to   the   Constitution,   as   original enacted, provided for three (03) categories of States i.e. Part ‘A’, 39 Part ‘B’ and Part ‘C’ States to comprise the territory of India.  The States   Reorganization   Act,   1956   and   the   consequential Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 drastically altered the   provisions   of   the   First   Schedule   to   the   Constitution   by establishment   of   new   States;   alteration   in   the   area   and boundaries of existing States and also by abolition of the three (03) categories of States; and by classification of certain areas as Union   Territories.     Pursuant   thereto   the   Government   of   Union Territories   Act,   1963   was   enacted   to   provide   for   Legislative Assemblies   and   Councils   of   Ministers   for   certain   Union Territories and for certain other incidental matters.  It will not be necessary to specifically deal with the provisions of the aforesaid Act in any great detail except to say that in course of time most of the Union Territories (except for Pondicherry), which had been provided with their own Legislatures and Councils of Ministers have   graduated   to   become   full­fledged   States   on   the   basis   of enactment of several State Reorganisation Acts details of which have   been   mentioned   (para   21).     The   Union   Territory   of Pondicherry,   as   on   date,   stands   out   as   sole   Union   Territory which   has   a   Legislature   and   Council   of   Ministers,   apart   from 40 Delhi.   38. Delhi, which was one of the original Union Territories, came to be called as “National Capital Territory of Delhi”.   This change   was   introduced   by   the   Constitution   (Sixty­Ninth Amendment)   Act,   1991   with   effect   from   1st  February,   1992   by insertion of Article 239­AA in Part VIII of the Constitution (i.e. Special   provisions   with   respect   to   Delhi).     Article   239­AA(3)(a) empower   the   Legislative   Assembly   of   the   National   Capital Territory   of   Delhi   to   make   laws   with   respect   to   any   matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List (i.e. List II and List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India) subject to certain exceptions.  It is here that the Union Territory of   Delhi   i.e.   National   Capital   Territory   of   Delhi   is   enjoined   a special status inasmuch as power to enact laws on any  of the subjects in List II and List III is a constitutional conferment as opposed to the position in the erstwhile Union Territories and the present day Union Territory of Pondicherry where the power to frame/make   laws   has   been   conferred   on   the   Union   Territory Legislatures by a Parliamentary enactment i.e. Section 18 of the 41 Government of Union Territories Act, 1963.  The above narration has   been   considered   necessary   only   to   make   the   discussion complete.     We make it clear that we are not entering into any discussion as to the special position/status of Delhi, if any, by virtue of the provisions contained in Article 239AA as the said issue does not arise for consideration in the present reference.   39. The above view coupled with the scope and ambit of the   present   reference   may   also   not   require   us   to   go   into   the correctness of the view expressed by this Court in paragraph 14 of the decision in  S. Pushpa  (supra) (as already extracted).   The resolution of the question formulated for an answer is capable of being reached by adopting an entirely different perspective which we intend to do hereinafter. 40. The   federal   nature   of   the   Constitution   finds   broad manifestation   in   two   principal   areas   i.e.   division   of   legislative power   and   exercise   thereof   by   the   Union   and   the   constituent States and secondly, which is more relevant and important to the subject   in   hand,   is   the   constitutional   provisions   relating   to services under the Union and the States as dealt with in Part XIV 42 of the Constitution. 41. The subject finds an elaborate study by Dr. D.D. Basu in “Commentary on the Constitution of India”10. According to Dr. D.D. Basu, “In India though the Union and the States have their own public services, (vide Entry 70 of List I and Entry 41   of   List   II)   there   is   no   clear­cut   bifurcation   in   the administration of the Union and the State laws as in the U.S.A. The State officials administer the State laws as well the   Union   laws   applicable   within   that   Sate   whereas   the members   of   the   Union   Services   while   working   within   a State,   also   carry   out   State   laws,   insofar   as   they   may   be applicable.   The   second   peculiarity   of   the   Indian   federal system   of   administration   is   that   though   the   federal   and State   Governments   have   civil   services   of   their   own   to manage   their   own   households,   there   are   certain   services known as the All­India Services, which are common to both the federal and State Governments.  10 8th Edition, 2011, Volume 9, Page 9858 43 The   organisation   of   the   Civil   services   in   the   Indian federal system may be demonstrated as thus:  All India Services Central Civil  Services State Civil Services Central Secretariat  Services”  Subordinate Services          42. At the  State Level, as Dr. D.D. Basu points out,  “the State Civil Services administer the subject solely belonging to   the   State   Governments,   according   to   the   federal distribution   of   subjects   thus   including   the   Judicial, Executive,   Medical,   Engineering,   Police,   Education branches. Their members are under the exclusive control of the   respective   State   Governments   and   their   duties   are confined to the territories of the State by which they have been   appointed,   unless   sent   on   deputation   to   the   Union Government”.11  These State Civil Services may be Administrative Services, Forest Services etc. [illustratively, in case of Himachal 11 8th Edition, Volume 9, 2011, Page 9860. 44 Pradesh,   Himachal   Pradesh   Administrative   Service   (HPAS)   is   a type of service, so is, Himachal Pradesh Forest Service (HPFS). The  recruitment   to   these  services  is   conducted  by   way   of   Civil Services   Examinations   organised   by   the   State­specific   Public Service   Commission   e.g.   in   case   of   Himachal   Pradesh,   it   is Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission.  As stated earlier, persons   inducted   into   the   State   Service   of   a   particular   State cannot   be   transferred   to   any   other   State.   These   officers   are concerned   with   only   the   affairs   of   the   state   in   which   they   are appointed.     These   services   (like   HPAS,   HPFS)   may,   for convenience, be called as Superior Services/Higher Services with reference   to   a   State.    But   in  addition   to  these  higher   services, there are also services that may, again for convenience, be called as   Subordinate   Services/Lower   Level   Jobs.   The   posts   in   these services   are   like   those   of   Clerks,   School   Teachers;   Drivers, Attendants, Safai Workers, etc.  For the purpose of recruitment of Subordinate Servants, states have in place State­specific Selection Commissions. 43. At the Federal Level, civil administration is carried out 45 by the members of – (1) All India Services (specifically provided for in Article 312); (2) Central Civil Services (although, not specifically provided for in the Constitution but are regulated by creation of statutory Rules framed under the proviso to Article 309). These are again Superior Services and the selection/recruitment is by the Union Public Service Commission. ALL INDIA SERVICES There are three All India Services (AIS) – (a) Indian Administrative Service   (IAS);   (b)   Indian   Forest   Service   (IFoS);   (c)   Indian   Police Service   (IPS).   As   regards   AIS,   Dr.   D.D.   Basu12  says   that,  “the peculiarity of the AIS from the federal standpoint is that – (a) Though they are recruited and their conditions of service are determined by the Union Government, they have to   administer   both   Union   and   the   State   subjects, accordingly as their services are placed at the disposal of the   Union   or   a   State   Government,   in   connection   with   the affairs of the Union or the State, as the case may be. (b) While   serving   in   a   State,   they   are   controlled   by 12 8th Edition, 2011, Volume 9, Page 9858. 46 the State Government, except as regards the imposition of the penalty of dismissal, removal or compulsory retirement, which can be awarded only by the Union Government. (c) In   a   sense,   this   system   is   an   exception   to   the usual federal precedent inasmuch as it is intended to fill up the   strategic   posts   both   under   the   Union   and   State Governments   by   men   of   superior   calibre,   recruited   on   a uniform   basis,   through   the   UPSC.   Thus,   while   a   Deputy Collector   may   be   a   member   of   the   State   Civil   Service,   the Additional  Collector  and the Collector may  be members  of the Indian Administrative Service. The category of AIS thus breaks   through   the   federal   division   so   far   as   the administrative services in India are concerned. In fact, the principal agents of a Sate administration are members of the AIS and it would be a mistake to suppose that the AIS exist for the administration of the Union subjects. Broadly, speaking, the administration of a State is run both by the members of the AIS and State Services, the latter supplying 47 only the intermediate and subordinate tiers. (d) Though   the   bulk   of   recruitment   to   the   AIS   is   by competitive examination, a certain proportion is selected by promotion   from   amongst   members   of   the   State   Civil Services. (e) Though a member of AIS may be required to serve anywhere in India, on recruitment, he is usually assigned to a   State   or   States   jointly,   or,   in   a   technical   language,   is included in a State cadre or Joint cadre and continues to serve   there   until   or   unless   he   is   called   upon   to   serve   the Union Government, in any of its Departments. (f) While   employed   under   a   State,   again,   the members   of   the   AIS   do   not   have   to   work   only   in   the Secretariat of the State but also in the Districts as already stated   and   members   of   these   services   are   expected   to acquire experience of the business in the district as well as Secretariat   administration   and   there   is   a   constant interchange   of   officers   between   the   Secretariat   and   the 48 Districts, just as there is such an interchange between the States and the Union Secretariats on the other hand.”   44. Therefore,   the   members   of   the   All   India   Services   are common  to  the  Union  and  the  States  and they   serve, by   turn, both the Union and State Governments. The members of these services   although   recruited   by   the   Centre   their   services   are placed under various State cadres. “It is evident from Article 312(1) that the members of the AIS are common to the Union and the States. Curiously, however, there is a cadre for the Indian Administrative Service only in the States, according to   the   Indian   Administrative   Service   (Cadre)   Rules,   1954 and there is no separate cadre for members of this service in   the   Government   of   India.   Each   members   of   the   Indian Administrative Service therefore, belongs to the cadre of one State or the other.” 13  45. There   are   many   State   Cadres   e.g.   Bihar   Cadre, Rajasthan   Cadre   and   Joint   Cadres   like   AGMUT   (for   Arunachal 13 D.D. Basu, 8th Edition, 2011, Volume 9, Page 10585. 49 Pradesh   +   Goa   +   Mizoram   +   the   7   Union   Territories).   These officers remain in the allotted Cadres till they retire. They are not normally to be transferred from one State Cadre to another State Cadre though they have the accountability to serve both under the State and the Centre. 46. At this juncture, the Union of India’s Affidavit may also be   referred   to,   which   states   with   reference   to   AIS   that,   “the conditions of service of these services (AIS) are regulated by the   DoPT   by   way   of   executive   and   statutory   instructions, statutory   rules   formulated   under   Article   309   of   the Constitution   and   Act   of   Parliament   etc.   The   functional control  of  some of  the services  rests  with  other  Ministries and   Departments   also.   The   Ministry   of   Home   Affairs exercises   functional   control   on   IPS   and   the   Ministry   of Environment   &   Forest   &   Climate   Change   exercises functional   control   on   IFoS.   Members   of   these   services   are allocated a cadre under a State or Union Territory and they serve the Union as well as the State, whichever is allotted to 50 them.   Thus   their   services   are   All   India   Services.   Their recruitment is by the Union Public Service Commission and as   they   serve   the   Union   as   well   as   the   States,   their recruitment   is   on   pan   India   basis.   Every   citizen   of   this country   having   the   required   qualification   is   eligible   to   be considered for the appointment. It is pertinent to note that before   selection   in   the   AIS,   there   is   no   specification   or indication of the cadre in Union, Union Territory or State, which they may serve. Upon selection alone, they would be allocated   cadre   depending   upon   the   merit   and   the preferences they would have made at the time of applying. Upon selection they could be allocated to serve through any of the 25 states or 7 Union Territories of Delhi; Puducherry; Chandigarh;   Daman   &   Diu;   Dadra   &   Nagar   Haveli; Andaman & Nicobar; Lakshadweep coupled with the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Goa and Mizoram” 14. 47. CENTRAL CIVIL SERVICES 14 Para 5 of the Affidavit. 51 The   Central   Civil   Services   (CCS),   as   Dr.   D.D.   Basu points out, “are engaged in administering the Union subjects, such   as   the   Posts   and   Telegraphs,   Customs   and   Excise, Income Tax. In short, these constitute all the administrative services in the Central Departments which have not so far been   included   in   the   list   of   All   India   Services.   They   are under   the   exclusive   control   of   the   Union   Government. Besides   the   Central   Services,   there   are   other   Services intended for  work solely in the Central  Secretariat, or, in other   words,   those   who   are   to   manage   the   offices   of   the Central   Departments.   Both   the   Central   Civil   Services   and Central Secretariat Services are sub­divided into Class I, II, III,   IV,   (=   Group   A,   B,   C,   D15)   according   to   the   rank   and responsibilities   of   the   officers…   Members   of   the   Central Services are also sent on transfer  or deputation  to States 15 Rule 6A of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 provides that, “All reference to Central Civil Services/Central Civil Posts, Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV in all Rules, Orders, Schedules, Notifications, Regulations, Instructions in force, immediately before the commencement of these rules shall be construed as references to Central Civil Services/Central Civil Posts, Group 'A', Group 'B', Group 'C' and Group 'D' respectively, and any reference to \"Class or Classes\" therein in this context shall be construed as reference to \"Group or Groups\", as the case may be.” 52 where offices relating to the Union subjects or Public Sector Undertakings   relating   thereto   are   located.”16  All   that   we would like to add is that though the members of these services are   concerned   only   with   the   affairs   of   the   Union/Centre   they discharge   such   duties   in   the   offices   and   establishments   of   the Union Government as may be located in the States and the Union Territories.  The Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal)   Rules,   1965   [CCS   Rules,   1965]   (enacted   under   the proviso   to   Article   309)   are   the   governing   statutory   Rules   with reference to these services. Rule 4 of CCS Rules, 1965 classifies the Central Civil Services into four types –  (i) Central Civil Services, Group A (45 services as per the Schedule to the Rules); (ii) Central Civil Services, Group B (33 services as per the Schedule to the Rules); (iii) Central   Civil   Services,   Group   C   (5   services   as   per   the Schedule to the Rules); (iv) Central  Civil  Services,  Group   D  (1  service  as   per   the 16 8th Edition. Volume 9, Page 9859. 53 Schedule to the Rules)17. 48. CCS Group A:  The Affidavit of the Union of India says that, “recruitment to   Group   A   services   is   made   by   UPSC.   The   recruitment   is again on all India basis. This is the reason the personnel belonging  to  these  45  services   work  in  the  posts  of  Union and the Union Territories (UT) across the length and breadth of the country. The Cadre Controlling Authority of Group A services are the respective ministries of the Government of India.   For   example,   the   first   service   being   the Archaeological   Service,   the   Cadre   Controlling   Authority   is the   Ministry   of   Culture,   Central   Government.   Another example, the 12th  service being the Indian Foreign Service and this is controlled by Ministry of External Affairs. No. 16 is   the   Indian   Revenue   Service   and   it   is   controlled   by   the Ministry   of   Finance.   The   members   of   these   services   being recruited pursuant to the Central Service Exams conducted 17 Para 6 of the Affidavit. 54 by   the   UPSC   are   allocated   to   the   respective   services. Whichever Ministry seeks recruitment to the service in this Group,   sends   requisition   to   UPSC   as   per   procedure prescribed and UPSC accordingly advertises for the post in Group A. Every citizen of India is eligible to apply as per the qualifications and requirements in the notification. DOPT is the nodal Ministry for regulating the conditions of service of all   Central   Civil   Services   as   per   Allocation   of   Business Rules.   As   per   the   conditions   of   service,   every   employee   is required to give an undertaking agreeing to the conditions of all India transfer liability at the time of joining service. Central Civil Services employees belonging to Group A serve the Union of India and that is the reason why these services are across the length and breadth of the country, wherever there is an office of the Central Government. Member of the Groups A service are governed by CCS Rules of 1965 as well as Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules 1972; Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 1972 and such other Rules made by 55 the Central Ministries.” 49. CCS Group B:  As   mentioned   earlier,   there   are   33   Group   B   Services. Amongst these, are the Union Territory Services listed at No. 28 and No. 29 and known as the ‘Delhi and Andaman and Nicobar Islands   Civil   Service’   abbreviated   as   ‘DANICS’   and   ‘Delhi   and Andaman   and   Nicobar   Islands   Police   Service’   (Grade   II) abbreviated as ‘DANIPS’.  While at this stage we may have also a look at Union Territory services in some detail. UNION TERRITORY SERVICES 50. The Government of India (Ministry of Home Affairs) by way of a notification dated 6th August, 2003, and in the exercise of   the   proviso   to   Article   309,   enacted   ‘the   National   Capital Territory of Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Havel (Civil Service) Rules, 2003   [DANICS   Rules,   2003].   As   also,   ‘the   National   Capital Territory of Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman   and   Diu   and   Dadra   and   Nagar   Havel   (Police   Service) 56 Rules, 2003 [DANIPS Rules, 2003]. 51. The DANICS/DANIPS Rules, 2003 define:­ *  ‘Administration’   to   mean   the   Government   of   the National   Capital   Territory   of   Delhi   in   respect   National   Capital Territory of Delhi and Union Territory Administration in respect of the   Union   Territories   of   –   Andaman   &   Nicobar   Islands; Lakshadweep; Daman & Diu; Dadra & Nagar Haveli [under Rule 2(a)] * ‘Commission’ to mean the Union Public Service Commission [under Rule 2(h)]. * ‘Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes’ to have the same meaning as are assigned to them by Articles 366(24) and 366(25) [under Rule 2(n)]. The   DANICS/DANIPS   Rules,   2003,   further,   state   that   posts   in Junior   Administrative   Grade­I,   Junior   Administrative   Grade­II, Selection Grade will be Central Civil Services (Group A), whereas Entry  Grade shall be Central Civil Services (Group B) [Rule 3]. The vacancies in DANICS/DANIPS shall be filled in on the basis 57 of the  Civil Services Examination  conducted  by   UPSC  [Rule 7]. Every member of DANICS/DANIPS allocated to an Administration shall be posted against a duty post18 under the Administration by the Administrator [Rule 12]. More importantly, the Government of India   shall,   from   time   to   time,   allocate   a   member   of DANICS/DANIPS   to   any   Administration   for   posting   [Rule   12]. Nothing in the Rules affects reservations, relaxation in age­limit and other concessions required to be provided for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and other special categories of persons in accordance with the orders issued by the Government of India from time to time in this regard [Rule 17: the Saving clause]. The Sanctioned Strength for DANICS and DANIPS   is   in   the   DANICS/DANIPS   Rules,   2003   (approximately 398 DANICS; approximately 355 DANIPS).   52. As   per   the   Union   of   India’s   Affidavit,   DANICS   and DANIPS are ‘Union Territory Services’19. The Affidavit says, “...at 18 Duty Posts are mentioned in the Schedule to these Rules. To name a few, these are - Joint Director of Social Welfare/Delhi; Joint Director of Education/Delhi; Deputy Medial Superintendent of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narain Hospital/Delhi; Registrar of Cooperative Societies/Port Blair; Assistant Commissioner of Police/Delhi; Deputy Superintendent of Police/Andaman & Nicobar; Chief of Police/Dadra & Nagar Haveli etc. 19 Page 4, Para (ii)(a) of the Affidavit. 58 Serial 28 and 29 of the Schedule (to CCS Rules, 1965), we have   the   Union   Territory   Services   known   as   DANICS   and DANIPS”. The Affidavit, further, says that, “DANICS/DANIPS Officers   are   posted   in   Delhi;   Andaman   &   Nicobar   Islands; Lakshadweep;   Daman   &   Diu;   Dadra   &   Nagar   Haveli.   The recruitment  to  all the  Union  Territories  for  these Group B posts   are   common.   They   are   also   centralised   and   the Appointing   Authority   is   none   other   than   the   Ministry   of Home Affairs (Joint Secretary). For the recruitment to these services, it is the very same examination meant for AIS and CCS   Group   A.   Any   citizen   of   India   is   eligible   to   apply, subject   to   the   conditions   prescribed.   As   per   the   Service Rules,   transfer   undertakings   throughout   the   Union Territories   covered   under   DANICS/DANIPS   is   taken   from these   officers.   This   is   the   reason   why   the   Union   of   India while   inviting   applications   for   recruitment   considers   all candidates,   including   reserved   candidates   on   all   India basis. Group B Cadre of DANICS/DANIPS is the Feeder Cadre 59 for IAS and IPS respectively (i.e. AIS). They retire invariably in these Offices, some of them reaching high positions in the Central Government. Recruitment to AIS; CCS Group A; CCS Group B (Gazetted) is conducted through UPSC. In the Civil Services Examination, the applicants are common when the applications are made. Every aspirant seeks recruitment to the   services   and   it   is   only   as   per   the   marks   and   ranking that allocations are made eventually to AIS; CCS Group A; CCS   Group   B.   Therefore,   when   UPSC   undertakes   the recruitment,   it   is   naturally   a   pan   India   recruitment   and therefore,   it   is   necessary   to   seek   applications   including from reserved candidates from all over India.”20   53. But   it   is   not   the   Members   of   the   All   India   Services (AGMUT Cadre); Central Civil Services (Group ‘A’ and ‘B’) and the ‘DANICS’ and ‘DANIPS’ who alone are the public servants in the States   and   the   Union   Territories   engaged   in   the   discharge   of duties in connection with the affairs of the Union.   There are and 20 Page 4, 5 of the Affidavit. 60 bound to be public servants that work the subordinate services.  CCS Group C: 54. At the subordinate level these are the Group ‘C’ posts. In the Schedule to CCS Rules, 1965, there are 5 such services. The Union of India’s Affidavit says that, “These posts, in so far, as   they   relate   to   services   under   the   Union   of   India   are concerned are recruited by the Staff Selection Commission (which   is   the   Recruiting   Agency   under   the   DoPT).   The members   of   CCS   Group   C   get   promoted   to   CCS   Group   B. Recruitment to posts in this group arise out of requisition made   by   the   concerned   ministries   all   over   India.   These requisitions, upon reaching, the Staff Selection Commission are processed and selection takes place and appointments are made. Even from these appointees, undertaking for all India   transfer  liability  is   taken.   As  these   are  posts   under the  Central Government  and these employees  are  liable to transferred   anywhere   in   the   country   and   the   recruitment being centralised for all such posts  in the country,  it has 61 been   consistent   policy   of   the   Union   of   India   to   have   pan India eligibility.”   55. With regard to CCS Group D posts, in the affidavit of the Union it is stated that “the posts under this category are primarily of what used to be Class IV employees now referred to as the Multi Tasking staff.   In recent years, Central Pay Commission   has   recommended   against   any   further recruitment to these posts in Group D.   Further it has also been   recommended   that   the   existing   posts   will   be   merged with Group C. Hence, this is now a vanishing cadre21.” 56. The   broad   picture   that   emanates   from   the   above discussion   and   narration   is   that   insofar   as   the   services   in connection   with   the   affairs   of   the   Union   is   concerned   (Central Services), wherever the establishment may be located i.e. in the National   Capital   Territory   of   Delhi   or   in   a   State   or   within   the geographical areas of Union Territory, recruitment to all positions is on an All India basis and reservation provided for is again a 21 Page 6, para iv.a. of the Affidavit 62 pan­ India reservation.  This by itself, from one perspective, may appear to be in departure from the rule set out in Part XVI of the Constitution of India (Articles 341 and 342).   However, the close look undertaken hereinbefore indicates such a position is fully in accord with the constitutional structure of a federal polity.  NATIONAL CAPITAL TERRITORY OF DELHI 57. In   case   of   National   Capital   Territory   of   Delhi, especially, to make the picture even clearer, a reference may be made to ‘Delhi Administration Subordinate Service Rules, 1967’. Rule 3 of the aforesaid Rules is to the following effect: “3. Constitution of service and its classification.­ (1) On and from the date of commencement of these Rules,   there   shall   be   constituted  one   Central   Civil Service,   known   as   the   Subordinate   Service   of   the Delhi Administration. (2) The Service shall have four Grades, namely— Grade I Grade II Grade III Grade IV (3) The posts in Grade I shall be Central Civil posts, Class II Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) and those in Grades II, III and IV shall be Central Civil posts Group ‘C’ (Non­ Gazetted). (4) Members   of   the   service   shall,   in   the   normal course be eligible for appointment to various Grades of   the   service   to   which   they   belong   and   not   to   the other service.” 63 (underlining is ours) Subordinate   services   in   the   National   Capital   Territory   of Delhi are, therefore, clearly Central Civil Services. The Affidavit of the Union also points out this feature by stating that, “The posts in   CCS   Group   C   are   in   the   subordinate   services.   The equivalent   in   the   Union   Territory   of   Delhi   is   the   Delhi Administrative   Subordinate   Services   (DASS)   and   the Recruiting   Agency   in   the   place   of  Staff   Selection Commission   is   the   Delhi   Subordinate   Service   Selection Board   (DSSSB).   Members   of   the   Delhi   Administrative Subordinate Services are the Feeder Cadre for Central Civil Services Group B (DANICS). It is for these reasons that the policy (of pan India eligibility) consistently adopted.”22  58. A   combined   reading   of   these   provisions   of   the   DASS Rules,   1967   and   CCS   Rules,   1965,   therefore,   more   than adequately   explains   the   nature   of   Subordinate   Services   in   the NCT   of   Delhi.     These   clearly   are   General   Central   Services   and perhaps, it is owing to this state of affairs that the Union of India 22 Page 6, Para (b) of the Affidavit. 64 in   its   Affidavit   has   stated   that,   “Members   of   the   Delhi Administrative   Subordinate   Services   are   the   Feeder   Cadre for Central Civil Services Group B (DANICS). It is for these reasons   that   the   policy   (of   pan   India   eligibility)   is consistently adopted.” 59. While examining the validity of reservation of seats in medical colleges for local candidates in Delhi, this Court in Dr. Jagdish Saran and Others Vs. Union of India23 had made certain observations with regard to the special status that the capital city enjoys,   which   today,   has   come   to   be   known   as   the   National Capital   Territory   of   Delhi.     The   observations   of   this   Court   in paragraphs   10   and   56   may   be   usefully   recapitulated   and, therefore, is set out below:   “10.  The capital city is not just a part of India. It is miniaturised   India,   a   fact   often   forgotten   by   the administration in the field of culture and education, especially   vis­a­vis   regional,   minorities.   It   is magapolitan   and   people   from   all   parts   flock   to   this outsized   city.   But   we   cannot   exaggerate   this   factor, for the presence of the farther regions like the South and the North­east, population­wise, is minimal and precarious.   Shri   Balakrishnan   insisted   that   the 23 (1980) 2 SCC 768 65 University   was   sustained   by   Central   Government finances,   collected   from   the  whole   country,   and   the benefits must likewise belong to all qualified students from everywhere. These are valuable aspects to shape policy   but  the  court  must  test  constitutionality  and no   more.   To   that   extent   alone   we   will   weigh   these factors in moulding our verdict. xxx   xxx   xxx  56. We may wind­up by articulating the core thought that vitalises our approach. Anyone who lives inside India can never be considered an ‘outsider’ in Delhi. The   people   in   the   States   are   caught   in   a   happy network of mutuality, woven into a lovely garment of humanity, whose warp and woof is India. This is the underlying   fundamental   of   the   preambular   resolve registered   in   our   National   Parchment.   So   we   insist that blind and bigoted local patriotism in xenophobic exclusivism is destructive of our Freedom and only if compelling   considerations   of   gross   injustice, desperate   backwardness   and   glaring   inequality desiderate   such   a   purposeful   course   can   protective discrimination   gain   entrance   into   the   portals   of college   campuses.   The   Administration   has   a constitutional   responsibility   not   to   be   a   mere thermometer   where   mercury   rises   with   populist pressure but to be a thermostat that transforms the mores   of   groups   to   stay   in   the   conscience   of   the nation viz. the Constitution.” 60. The   Affidavit   of   the   Union   does   not   touch   upon   the details   of   Subordinate   Services   in   other   Union   Territories. Neither   the   authorities   of   the   other  Union   Territories   have   laid before   the   Court   any   relevant   material   in   this   regard.     We, 66 therefore, refrain from addressing the issue in question as far as other   Union   Territories   are   concerned   and   have   confined   our discussions   and   the   consequential   views   only   to   the   National Capital Territory of Delhi.  61. Accordingly, we answer the question referred in terms of the views expressed in para 34 of this opinion.  We further hold that so far as the National Capital Territory of Delhi is concerned the   pan   India   Reservation   Rule   in   force   is   in   accord   with   the constitutional scheme relating to services under the Union and the States/Union Territories. 62. In view of the conclusions reached as above, it will not be necessary to remit Civil Appeal Nos. 1085 of 2013, 10081 of 2014, 8141 of 2014, 8802 of 2012, 1086 of 2013 and Civil Appeal arising   out   of   Special   Leave   Petition   (Civil)   No.36324   of   2017 (pertaining to Delhi) for further consideration by the appropriate Bench.  Accordingly, we dispose of the said appeals (pertaining to Delhi) in terms of the present order. So far as Civil Appeal Nos.9935­9937 of 2014 pertaining to the U.T. of Andaman and Nicobar Island are concerned the issue 67 may be decided by the appropriate Bench in the light of the views expressed   herein   on   adequate   and   sufficient   materials   being placed before the Bench by the contesting parties.  ..……………………………………., J.  [RANJAN GOGOI] ..……………………………………., J.  [N.V. RAMANA] ..……………………………………., J.

BANUMATHI, J. Reference Order:- I have gone through the judgment proposed by His Lordship Justice Ranjan Gogoi. I agree with the following conclusions arrived at in paras (30) and (34) and the reasonings thereon. \"A person notified as a Scheduled Caste in State 'A' cannot claim the same status in another State on the basis that he is declared as a Scheduled Caste in State 'A'......\". \".......It will, therefore, be in consonance with the constitutional scheme 69 to understand the enabling provision under Article 16(4) to be available to provide reservation only to the classes or categories of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes enumerated in the Presidential orders for a particular State/Union Territory within the geographical area of that State/Union Territory (Union Territory added by me) and not beyond.\" With due respect, I do not agree with the conclusion arrived at in para (61) and the reasonings thereon. “......So far as the National Capital Territory of Delhi is concerned the pan-India Reservation Rule in force is in accord with the constitutional scheme relating to services under the Union and the States/Union Territories.\" For agreeing with the conclusion arrived at in paras (30) and (34) and for differing from the conclusions in para (61) and the reasonings thereon, I have given my own reasonings. 2. The extent and nature of interplay and interaction under Articles 16(4), 341(1) and 342(1) of the Constitution of India was referred to the Constitution Bench in State of Uttaranchal v. Sandeep Kumar Singh and Ors., (2010) 12 SCC 794, with the following reference:- \"13. A very important question of law as to interpretation of Articles 16(4), 341 and 342 arises for consideration in this appeal. Whether the Presidential Order issued under Article 341(1) or Article 342(1) of the Constitution has any bearing on the State’s action in making provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any Backward Class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State? The extent and nature of interplay and interaction among Articles 16(4), 341(1) and 342(1) of the Constitution is required to be resolved.\" 70 3. Territory of India:- Article 1(1) of the Constitution of India declares that India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. As amended by the Constitution Seventh (Amendment) Act, 1956. Article 1 of the Constitution reads as under:- 1. Name and territory of the Union.- (1) India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. (2) The States and the territories thereof shall be as specified in the First Schedule. (3) The territory of India shall comprise— (a) the territories of the States; (b) the Union Territories specified in the First Schedule; and (c) such other territories as may be acquired. 4. Under the Constitution of India, as initially enacted, the States were divided into Part A States, Part B States, Part C States and the territories in Part D. Substantial changes were made by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 which incorporated the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission and was to have effect in concert with the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. The four categories of States that existed were reduced to two categories. The first of these categories - Part A and Part B States comprised one class, called \"States\". The second category comprised the areas which had earlier been included in Part C and Part D States; these areas were called \"Union Territories\". Some additions and deletions were made to the existing lists. Now as per Schedule I, there are twenty-nine States 71 and Seven Union Territories. 5. The expression “State” is not defined in the Constitution. It is defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897 which is made applicable to the interpretation of the Constitution by Article 367. As on the date of the commencement of the Constitution, clause (58) in Section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 defined “State” in the following words:- “3. (58) ‘State’, — shall mean a Part A State, a Part B State or a Part C State.” The said definition was amended by the Adaptation of Laws Order No. 1 of 1956 issued by the President in exercise of the power conferred upon him by Article 372-A of the Constitution introduced by the Constitution Seventh (Amendment) Act, 1956. The amended definition 'State' reads thus:- “3. (58) ‘State’, — (a) as respects any period before the commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, shall mean a Part A State, a Part B State or a Part C State; and (b) as respects any period after such commencement, shall mean a State specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution and shall include a Union Territory.” 6. Clause (30) in Article 366 defines the “Union Territory” in the following words:- “366. (30) ‘Union Territory’ means any Union Territory specified in the First Schedule and includes any other territory comprised with the territory of India but not specified in that Schedule.” 72 7. Clause (24) of Article 366 defines “Scheduled Castes” and clause (25) of Article 366 defines “Scheduled Tribes”. The latter means “such tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to be 'Scheduled Tribes' for the purposes of this Constitution”. Article 341(1) of the Constitution empowers the President, in consultation with the Governor of the State concerned, to specify Scheduled Castes by public notification. Equally, Article 342(1) of the Constitution empowers the President “with respect to any State or Union Territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities which shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be 'Scheduled Tribes' in relation to that State or Union Territory, as the case may be”. Article 342(2) of the Constitution empowers “Parliament, by law, to include in or exclude from the list of 'Scheduled Tribes' specified in a notification issued under clause (1), any tribe or tribal community or part of or group within any tribe or tribal community, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification.” Until the Presidential Notification is modified by appropriate amendment by Parliament in exercise of the power under Article 341(2) of the 73 Constitution, the Presidential Notification issued under Article 341(1) is final and conclusive and any caste or group cannot be added to it or subtracted by any action either by the State Government or by a Court on adducing of evidence. In other words, it is the constitutional mandate that the tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities specified by the President, after consultation with the Governor in the public notification, will be 'Scheduled Tribes' subject to the law made by Parliament alone, which may, by law, include in or exclude from the list of 'Scheduled Tribes' specified by the President. Thereafter, it cannot be varied except by law made by the Parliament. 8. The President of India alone is competent or authorized to issue an appropriate Notification in terms of Article 341(1) and Article 342(1). Cumulative reading of Articles 338, 341 and 342 indicate that:- a) Only the President could notify castes/tribes as Scheduled Castes/Tribes and also indicate conditions attaching to such declaration. A public Notification by the President specifying the particular castes or tribes as SC/ST shall be final for the purpose of Constitution and shall be exhaustive. b) Once a notification is issued under clause (1) of Articles 74 341 and 342 of the Constitution, the Parliament can by law include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, specified in the notification, any caste or tribe but save for that limited purpose the notification issued under clause (1), shall not be varied by any subsequent notification24. 9. It is stated that before notification was issued under Article 341(1) and Article 342(1) notifying certain caste/race or group as Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe, an elaborate enquiry was made and also after such enquiry, the Presidential Order was issued. While doing so, Presidential Order not only specified parts or groups of caste, races or tribes but also made the said specification by reference to different areas in the State. By perusal of the Presidential Order, it is clear that some caste/race is actually confined with reference to a particular area; for instance, confined to a particular taluk in a district. The reason for such specification by reference to different areas in the State being educational, social backwardness, races or tribes cannot be the same throughout the State. The consideration for specifying a particular caste or tribe or class for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes or Backward Classes in a given State would depend on the nature and extent of the disadvantages and social hardships 24 Ref. Action Committee on Issue of Caste Certificate to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the State of Maharashtra and Anr. v. Union of India (UOI) and Anr. (1994) 5 SCC 244. 75 suffered in that State. These may be absent in another State to which these persons belonging to other States may migrate. 10. Whenever States' reorganization took place in the past, Parliament exercised its powers under Articles 341(2) and 342(2) and provided for specific Castes/Tribes that had to be Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in relation to the reorganized States/Union Territories. The Constitution Scheduled Caste Orders and the Constitution Scheduled Castes (Union Territories) Order, also clarify that Parliament's intention was to extend benefits of reservation in relation to the States/Union Territories in terms of the castes, races or tribes mentioned as per the Presidential Orders themselves. 11. Presidential Order which provided for castes/races, tribes recognized as 'Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe' and their interpretation cannot be challenged or agitated in a court of law. The question whether Dohar caste is a sub-caste of Chamar caste which is recognized as a Scheduled Caste came up for consideration in Bhaiya Lal v. Harikishan Singh, AIR 1965 SC 1557, wherein this Court held that the court cannot enquire into whether Dohar caste is a sub-caste of 76 Chamar caste and whether the same must be deemed to have been included in the Presidential Order. In Bhaiya Lal's case, this Court held \"...that before a notification is issued under Article 341(1), an elaborate enquiry is made and it is as a result of this enquiry that social justice is sought to be done to the castes, races or tribes as may appear to be necessary, and in doing justice...” and while doing so, the notification not only to specify parts or groups of castes, races or tribes but to make specification by reference to different areas in the State. In Bhaiya Lal's case, the Supreme Court held that only the Parliament is empowered to amend the Notification under Articles 341(2) and 342(2) of the Constitution. 12. Presidential Notification (Scheduled Caste) Order 1950:- The List of Scheduled Castes is contained in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950. The Presidential Notifications of 1950 and 1951 (as amended) in relation to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of various States, very importantly provided that:- \"2. Subject to the provisions of this Order, the castes, races or tribes or parts of, or groups within, castes or tribes specified in [Parts I to XXV] of the Schedule to this Order shall, in relation to the States to which those Parts respectively relate, be deemed to be Scheduled Castes so far as regards members thereof resident in the localities specified in relation to them respectively in those Parts of that Schedule.\" 77 The Presidential Notification of 1950 was amended by the Constitution (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Order), Amendment Act, 1956, (Act No.63 of 1956). Another amending Act was enacted by Parliament in 1976. Further, amendments had taken place as and when Parliament reorganized States like Bombay, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand through separate Acts. All these were Parliamentary enactments. Presidential Notification pertaining to Union Territories, Scheduled Castes (Union Territories) Order, 1951 specifies Scheduled Castes resident in the Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh and Daman and Diu. When new Union Territories were formed such as Pondicherry, Sikkim, Goa, Daman and Diu, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes Orders were made in relation to those new Union Territories. 13. The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 195025:- In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of Article 342 of the Constitution of India the President has, after consultation with the Governors of the States concerned, made the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950, specifying the tribes or communities which shall be deemed to be 25 Ref. Election Manual (1984), p.44 quoted in Commentary on the Constitution of India 8th Ed. by Durga Das Basu. 78 Scheduled Tribes in the States mentioned therein. This Order has been amended by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Act No.108 of 1976), the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Act, 1991 (16 of 1991), the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 1991 (39 of 1991), the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 2002 (32 of 2002), the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 2002 (10 of 2003), the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Act, 2003 (47 of 2003), the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Act 2006 (48 of 2006), the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Act, 2008 (14 of 2008) and the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Union Territories Order (Amendment) Act, 2008 (2 of 2009). As it stands amended, it specifies the Scheduled Tribes resident in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, West Bengal. 14. Article 16(4) is only an enabling provision to provide reservation to backward classes. Clause (4) of Article 16 of the Constitution cannot be 79 made applicable for the purpose of grant of benefit of reservation for Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes in a State or Union Territory, who have migrated to another State or Union Territory and they are not members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the State to which they have migrated. The Presidential Orders made under Article 341 and Article 342 have an overriding status. The presence of Articles 338, 338A, 341, 342 of the Constitution clearly shows that it precludes any tinkering or deviation from the list of castes or tribes notified in the Presidential Order which are reserved for that State or that Union territory. 15. India is huge. There is Unity in Diversity. Diversity in terms of language, culture, demography, geographical area, development of regions, opportunities available to individuals for education and to make social and economical advancement etc. Some States are well- developed; some other States are developing; few other States are under-developed. All the affirmative action of the States is to provide equality of opportunity to the socially and economically disadvantaged group. Under Article 15(4) of the Constitution, State is empowered to make special provisions for the advancement of any socially and 80 educationally backward class of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. Article 16 of the Constitution of India lays down that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State. Article 16(4) of the Constitution empowers the State to make provisions to provide reservation to the backward classes in employment or appointment to any posts and thereby to create equally opportunities for their socio- economic empowerment and their emancipation. Article 16(4) speaks of one type of reservation namely reservation of appointments/posts. 16. Article 16(4) of the Constitution is an enabling provision directed towards achieving equality of opportunity in services under the State. Observing that Article 14 of the Constitution is the genus while Article 16 is the species, in E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr., (1974) 4 SCC 3, it was held that:- \"85. .........Article 16 embodies the fundamental guarantee that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State. Though enacted as a distinct and independent fundamental right because of its great importance as a principle ensuring equality of opportunity in public employment which is so vital to the building up of the new classless egalitarian society envisaged in the Constitution, Article 16 is only an instance of the application of the concept of equality enshrined in Article 14. In other words, Article 14 is the genus while Article 16 is a species. Article 16 gives effect to the doctrine of equality in all matters relating to public employment. The basic principle which, therefore, informs both Articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition against 81 discrimination. Now, what is the content and reach of this great equalising principle? It is a founding faith, to use the words of Bose. J., “a way of life”, and it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We cannot countenance any attempt to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be “cribbed, cabined and confined” within traditional and doctrinaire limits........\" [Underlining added] 17. The Constitution Bench of nine Judges in Indra Sawhney and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors., (1992) Supp 3 SCC 217, observed that Article 16(4) of the Constitution is aimed at 'protective equality' and it was held as under:- \"563. Thus, Article 16(1) and (4) operate in the same field. Both are directed towards achieving equality of opportunity in services under the State. One is broader in sweep and expansive in reach. Other is limited in approach and narrow in applicability. Former applies to 'all' citizens whereas latter is available to 'any' in Article 16(4) read together indicate that they are part of same scheme. The one is substantive equality and other is protective equality. Article 16(1) is fundamental right of a citizen whereas Article 16(4) is an obligation of the State. The former is enforceable in a Court of law, whereas the latter is 'not constitutional compulsion' but an enabling provision. Whether Article 16(4) is in substance, 'an exception', 'a proviso', or an 'emphatic way of putting the extent to which equality of opportunity could be carried', or 'presumed to exhaust all exceptions in favour of backward class', or 'expressly designed as benign discrimination devoted to lifting to backward classes', but if Article 16(1) is the positive aspect of equality of opportunity', Article 16(4) is a complete Code for reservation for backward class of citizens as it not only provides for exercise of power but also lays down the circumstances, in which the power can be exercised, and the purpose and extent or its exercise. One is mandatory and operates automatically whereas the other comes into play on identification of backward class of citizens and their inadequate representation.\" [Underlining added] 18. Article 16(4) of the Constitution is not an exception; but a facet of 82 Article 14 and Article 16(1) of the Constitution; it enables the State to effectuate equality of opportunity to any backward class. As held in Chattar Singh and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan and Ors. (1996) 11 SCC 742 in paras (17) and (18), that \"....It gives power to the state to effectuate the opportunity of equality to any backward class of citizens. ……..The object of reservation for the Scheduled Casts and Scheduled Tribes is to bring them into the mainstream of national life, while the objective in respect of the backward classes is to remove their social and educational handicaps. Therefore, they are always treated dissimilar and they do not form an integrated class with Dalits and Tribes for the purpose of Article 16(4) or 15 (4)...\". 19. In State of Kerala and Anr. v. N.M. Thomas and Ors. (1976) 2 SCC 310 in para (178), it was held that \"...differences and disparities exist among men and things and they cannot be treated alike by the application of the same laws but the law has to come in terms with life and must be able to recognize the genuine differences and disparities that exist in human nature. Legislature has also to enact legislation to meet specific ends by making a reasonable and rational classification..\". 83 20. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao v. Dean, Seth G.S. Medical College and Ors., (1990) 3 SCC 130 had the occasion to consider the question as to whether a member of Gouda community which is recognised as “Scheduled Tribe” in the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 would be entitled to admission in a medical institution situated in the State of Maharashtra. Based on the Government of India circular dated 22.02.1985, the appellant was denied admission to the Medical College on the ground that Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao was not a ‘Scheduled Tribe’ in the migrated State i.e. State of Maharashtra. 21. After referring to various provisions of Constitution of India, background in which the Presidential Order was issued and earlier judgments, in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao's case, it was held as under:- \"9. It appears that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in some States had to suffer the social disadvantages and did not have the facilities for development and growth. It is, therefore, necessary in order to make them equal in those areas where they have so suffered and are in the state of underdevelopment to have reservations or protection in their favour so that they can compete on equal terms with the more advantageous or developed sections of the community. Extreme social and economic backwardness arising out of traditional practices of untouchability is normally considered as criterion for including a community in the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The social conditions of a caste, however, varies from State to State and it will not be proper to generalise any caste or any tribe as a 84 Scheduled Tribe or Scheduled Caste for the whole country. This, however, is a different problem whether a member or the Scheduled Caste in one part of the country who migrates to another State or any other Union territory should continue to be treated as a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in which he has migrated. That question has to be judged taking into consideration the interest and well-being of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the country as a whole.\" 22. Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao case was followed by another Constitution Bench of this Court in Action Committee on issue of caste certificate to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the State of Maharashtra and Anr. v. Union of India and Anr. (1994) 5 SCC 244. In Action Committee's case, it was held as under:- \"3. On a plain reading of clause (1) of Articles 341 and 342 it is manifest that the power of the President is limited to specifying the castes or tribes which shall, for the purposes of the Constitution, be deemed to be Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes in relation to a State or a Union Territory, as the case may be. Once a notification is issued under clause (1) of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution, Parliament can by law include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, specified in the notification, any caste or tribe but save for that limited purpose the notification issued under clause (1), shall not be varied by any subsequent notification. What is important to notice is that the castes or tribes have to be specified in relation to a given State or Union Territory. That means a given caste or tribe can be a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in relation to the State or Union Territory for which it is specified. These are the relevant provisions with which we shall be concerned while dealing with the grievance made in this petition. .... 16. We may add that considerations for specifying a particular caste or tribe or class for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes/Schedule Tribes or backward classes in a given State would depend on the nature and extent of disadvantages and social hardships suffered by that caste, tribe or class in that State which may be totally non est in another State to which persons belonging thereto may migrate. Coincidentally it may be that a caste or tribe bearing the same nomenclature is specified in two States but the considerations on the 85 basis of which they have been specified may be totally different. So also the degree of disadvantages of various elements which constitute the input for specification may also be totally different. Therefore, merely because a given caste is specified in State A as a Scheduled Caste does not necessarily mean that if there be another caste bearing the same nomenclature in another State the person belonging to the former would be entitled to the rights, privileges and benefits admissible to a member of the Scheduled Caste of the latter State “for the purposes of this Constitution”. This is an aspect which has to be kept in mind and which was very much in the minds of the Constitution- makers as is evident from the choice of language of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution....\" Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao's case and Action Committee's case were followed in Subhash Chandra and Anr. v. Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board and Ors., (2009) 15 SCC 458. In Subhash Chandra case, the Supreme Court reiterated that “If a caste or tribe is notified in terms of the Scheduled Castes Order or the Scheduled Tribes Order, the same must be done in terms of clause (1) of Article 341 as also that of Article 342 of the Constitution of India, as the case may be. No deviation from the procedure laid down therein is permissible in law. If any amendment/alteration thereto is required to be made, recourse to the procedure laid down under clause (2) thereof must be resorted to.\" 23. In Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao's case, it was held that a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe of any State which depends on the nature and extent of disadvantages and social hardships suffered by the caste, tribe or class in that State or area may be non-existent in another 86 State. The inclusion of the castes, races or tribes is mainly based on the degree of disadvantages or hardships faced by the castes, races or tribes in that State or in some cases or in part area of the State. For instance, in the Presidential Order relating to the State of Tamil Nadu, the caste Kanikaran, Kanikkar (in Kanyakumari District and Shenkottah and Ambasaundram taluks of Tirunelveli district) are notified as Scheduled Castes. This shows that the President can specify castes, races or tribes or parts thereof in relation not only to the entire State but in relation to the parts of the State. The President has been authorised to limit the notification to parts of the State or groups within castes, races or tribes. In Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao case, the Constitution Bench therefore held that the expression “in relation to that State” must be read meaningfully; otherwise the expression “in relation to that State” would come nugatory. 24. The Presidential Order issued under Article 341 of the Constitution in regard to Scheduled Castes and Article 342 of the Constitution in regard to Scheduled Tribes cannot be varied by anyone or by the Court. Only the Parliament by law include or exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes specified in a notification issued under Article 341(1) and Article 342(1) of the Constitution respectively any 87 caste, race or tribe or parts or group within any caste, race or tribe. The Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes thus specified in relation to one State or Union Territory does not carry their status in another State or Union Territory. When the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes are specified for each State and in some cases, specific areas of the State or Union Territory, neither the State legislature nor the courts can include or exclude other Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes so specified in some States or Union Territories which would be against the mandate of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution and the Presidential Orders issued thereon. If that is permitted, it would amount to addition or alteration of the Presidential Order which is violative of the Constitutional Scheme. 25. State of Maharashtra v. Milind and Ors. (2001) 1 SCC 4, dealt with a question as to whether the notified Scheduled Tribe being Halba or Halbi as contained in item 19 of the Presidential Order would include \"Halba-Koshti\". This Court held that addition of \"Halba-Koshti\" in the Presidential Order would amount to amendment thereto which is impermissible in law. In Milind's case, it was held as under:- \"33......The jurisdiction of the High Court would be much more restricted while dealing with the question whether a particular caste or tribe would come within the purview of the notified Presidential Order, considering the language of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution. These being the parameters and in the case in hand, the Committee 88 conducting the inquiry as well as the Appellate Authority, having examined all relevant materials and having recorded a finding that Respondent 1 belonged to “Koshti” caste and has no identity with “Halba/Halbi” which is the Scheduled Tribe under Entry 19 of the Presidential Order, relating to the State of Maharashtra, the High Court exceeded its supervisory jurisdiction by making a roving and in-depth examination of the materials afresh and in coming to the conclusion that “Koshtis” could be treated as “Halbas”. In this view the High Court could not upset the finding of fact in exercise of its writ jurisdiction. Hence, we have to essentially answer Question 2 also in the negative. Hence it is answered accordingly.\" 26. When the Parliament restricts the benefit of reservation by inclusion of a caste as a Scheduled Caste to a State or part of State i.e. certain specified districts in a State, the Court cannot express any opinion as to its correctness. Hence, as regards the inclusion of caste “Mochi” in the list of Scheduled Castes within a particular area as per Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2002, it was held that it was not for the Court to render any opinion in regard to the correctness of the same. [vide Shree Surat Valsad Jilla K.M.G. Parishad v. Union of India and Ors. (2007) 5 SCC 360]. 27. The executive instructions/circulars issued by the Government of India also reiterate to well-settled position. The circular No. BC-16014/1/82-SC & BCD-I dated 06.08.1984 of the Ministry of Home Affairs addressed to all State Governments and UT Administration states 89 that SC and ST on migration from the State of his origin to another State will not lose his status as SC/ST; but will be entitled to the concession/benefits admissible to the SC/ST from the State of his origin and not from the State where he has migrated. The relevant portion of the said circular reads as under:- No. BC-16014/1/82-SC & BCD-I Government of India/Bharat Sarkar Ministry of Home Affairs/GrihMantralaya New Delhi, the 6th August, 1984 To, The Chief Secretaries of All State Governments and U.T. Administrations. Subject: - Verification of claim of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and migrants from other States/Union Territories-Form of certificate-Amendment to. Sir, …….. 2. The instructions issued in this Ministry’s letter of even number dated the 18.11.1982 will continue. It is, however, clarified that the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe person on migration from the State of his origin to another State will not lose his status as Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes but he will be entitled to the concessions/benefits admissible to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes from the State of his origin and not from the State where he has migrated…… (Underlining added) Yours faithfully Sd/- Joint Secretary to Govt. of India 28. The same thing was reiterated in the circular dated 22.02.1985 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs which has also clarified that a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe person who has migrated from the 90 State of origin to some other State for the purpose of seeking education, employment, etc. will be deemed to be a Scheduled Caste/Tribe of the State of his origin and will be entitled to derive benefits from the State of origin and not from the State to which he has migrated. 29. My Conclusion for agreeing with the view taken in paras (30) and (32):- It is now settled law that a person belonging to Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe in State 'A' cannot claim the same status in another State 'B' on the ground that he is declared as a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe in State 'A'. The expressions \"in relation to that State or Union Territory\" and \"for the purpose of this Constitution\" used in Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India are to be meaningfully interpreted. A given caste or tribe can be a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in relation to that State or Union Territory for which it is specified. Thus, the person notified as a Scheduled Caste in State 'A' cannot claim the same status in another State on the basis that he was declared Scheduled Caste in State 'A'. Article 16(4) has to yield to the Constitutional mandate of Articles 341 and 342. Union Territories: 30. Part VIII of the Constitution of India deals with Union Territories. 91 Article 239 provides that the Union Territory shall be administered by the President acting through an Administrator to be appointed by him. Article 239 reads as follows:- “239. Administration of Union Territories (1) Save as otherwise provided by Parliament by law, every Union Territory shall be administered by the President acting, to such extent as he thinks fit, through an administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Part VI, the President may appoint the Governor of a State as the administrator of an adjoining Union Territory, and where a Governor is so appointed, he shall exercise his functions as such administrator independently of his Council of Ministers.” 31. Article 239A was inserted by the Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment) Act, 1962. Article 239A of the Constitution of India empowers the Parliament to create by law legislatures and Council of Ministers in the then Union Territories of Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Goa, Daman & Diu and Pondicherry. Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram were added later. With Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Goa and Mizoram all becoming full-fledged States, the only Union Territory left under Article 239A is Pondicherry. Now, Union Territory of Pondicherry (Puducherry) also has a legislature and Council of Ministers. 32. Article 341 empowers the President “with respect to any State or 92 Union Territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes which shall for the purposes of this Constitution, be deemed to be Scheduled Caste in relation to that State or Union Territory as the case may be.” Equally Article 342(1) empowers the President “with respect to any State or Union Territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities which shall for the purposes of the Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Tribes in relation to that State or Union Territory, as the case may be”. Articles 341(2) and 342(2) of the Constitution empower the Parliament alone by law to include or exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes specified by notification issued under Articles 341(1) and 342(1) of the Constitution of India. Until the Presidential Notification is modified by appropriate amendment by Parliament in exercise of the power under Articles 341(2) or 342(2) of the Constitution, the Presidential Notification issued under Articles 341(1) and 342(1) of the Constitution is final and conclusive. No caste or group can be added to it or subtracted by any action either by the State Government or by a Court on adducing of evidence. Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution 93 do not make any distinction between a ‘State’ or ‘Union Territory’. 33. Constitution (Scheduled Castes) (Union Territories) Order, 1951:- In exercise of powers under Clause (1) of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution, the Presidential Notifications were issued specifying Scheduled Castes in relation to various Union Territories. List of Scheduled Castes are declared in relation to each Union Territory separately. Presidential Notification pertaining to Union Territories, Scheduled Castes (Union Territories) Order, 1951 specifies Scheduled Castes resident in the Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh and Daman and Diu. The Presidential Order provided that:- \"Subject to the provisions of this Order, the castes, races or tribes or parts of, or groups within, castes or tribes, specified in *[Parts I to III] of the Schedule to this Order shall, in relation to the *[Union territories] to which those parts respectively relate, be deemed to be Scheduled Castes so far as regards members thereof resident in the localities specified in relation to them respectively in those Parts of that Schedule.\" As and when there is reorganisation of the Union Territories, in exercise of the powers conferred under Article 341(1) of the Constitution, the President has made various orders. 34. The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) (Union Territories) Order, 94 195126:- In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of Article 342 of the Constitution of India, as amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, the President made the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) (Part C States) Order, 1951, specifying the tribes or communities which shall be deemed to be 'Scheduled Tribes’ in Part C State. This Order was adapted for the Union Territories by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Lists (Modification) Order, 1956. 35. When new territories were formed, such as Pondicherry (Puducherry), or Sikkim, the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes Orders were made in relation to the new territories. In exercise of the powers under Articles 341(1) and 342(1), the President has made the orders - The Constitution (Dadra and Nagar Haveli) Scheduled Castes Order, 1962; The Constitution (Dadra and Nagar Haveli) Scheduled Tribes Order, 1962; The Constitution (Pondicherry) Scheduled Castes Order, 1964; The Constitution (Goa, Daman and Diu) Scheduled Caste Order, 1968; The Constitution (Goa, Daman and Diu) Scheduled Tribes Order, 1968; In the case of Goa, the Goa, Daman and Diu Reorganisation Act, 1987 (Act No.18 of 1987), by Section 19 amended the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders. 26 Ref. Ibid., p.53, quoted in Article 342 of commentary on the Constitution of India 8th Ed. by Durga Das Basu. 95 36. Union Territories do not become merged with the Central Government:- The Union Territories are centrally administered by the President acting through an administrator. As held by this Court in New Delhi Municipal Council v. State of Punjab & Ors. (1997) 7 SCC 339, the President, who is the executive head of a Union Territory while administering the Union Territory, does not function as the head of the Central Government, but as the head of the Union Territory under powers specially vested in him under Article 239 of the Constitution thereby occupying a position analogous to that of a Governor in a State. Though the Union Territories are centrally administered under the provisions of Article 239, they do not become merged with the Central Government as has been held by this Court in Satya Dev Bushahri v. Padam Dev and Ors. AIR 1954 SC 587. They are centrally administered; but they retain their independent identity [Chandigarh Administration and Anr. v. Surinder Kumar and Ors. (2004) 1 SCC 530]. The Union Territory does not entirely lose its existence as an entity though large control is exercised by the Union of India. [Government of NCT Delhi v. All India Central Civil Accounts, Jao's Association and Ors. (2002) 1 SCC 344] 96 37. View taken in Pushpa and Chandigarh Administration – not correct view:- Reliance was placed upon Pushpa’s case to contend that Article 16(4) is not controlled by the Presidential Order issued under Article 341(1) or Article 342(1) to the Officers appointed to the post in the Union Territories need not be confined to only such Schedule Castes/Schedule Tribes of the particular Union Territory. In Pushpa’s case, the Supreme Court was confined with the question as to whether, selection and appointment already made to migrants’ Schedule Caste candidates of other States against the quota reserved for the Schedule Caste candidates in the Union Territory of Pondicherry was legal and valid. In S. Pushpa and Ors. v. Shivachanmugavelu and Ors. (2005) 3 SCC 1, Pondicherry Government appointed Selection Grade Teachers in 1995 under the Scheduled Castes quota not only from the Scheduled Castes candidates of Pondicherry but also such candidates of Scheduled Castes from other States. In Pushpa's case, this Court upheld the policy of the Pondicherry Government extending the benefit of reservation of SC/ST seats even to those candidates who came from other States. The Pondicherry Government proceeded on the basis that since Central Government jobs were open to all SC/ST candidates 97 irrespective of origin of their States, the same may apply to jobs with a Union Territory as well. In Pushpa's case, this Court held that in the matter of providing reservation, it was open to the Pondicherry Government to extend the benefit of reservation to migrant Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates and that the same will not be an infraction of clause (4) of Article 16 of the Constitution of India. 38. In Pushpa's case, the principle that “when members of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes migrate to another State, they do not carry with them the special privileges and advantages”, was held not applicable in case of Union Territories. In para (21) of Pushpa's case, it was held as under:- \"21.....Article 16(4) is not controlled by a Presidential Order issued under Article 341(1) or Article 342(1) of the Constitution in the sense that reservation in the matter of appointment on posts may be made in a State or Union Territory only for such Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which are mentioned in the Schedule appended to the Presidential Order for that particular State or Union Territory. This article does not say that only such Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which are mentioned in the Presidential Order issued for a particular State alone would be recognised as backward classes of citizens and none else. If a State or Union Territory makes a provision whereunder the benefit of reservation is extended only to such Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes which are recognised as such in relation to that State or Union Territory then such a provision would be perfectly valid. However, there would be no infraction of clause (4) of Article 16 if a Union Territory by virtue of its peculiar position being governed by the President as laid down in Article 239 extends the benefit of reservation even to such migrant Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes who are not mentioned in the Schedule to the Presidential Order issued for such Union Territory. The UT of 98 Pondicherry having adopted a policy of the Central Government whereunder all Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, irrespective of their State are eligible for posts which are reserved for SC/ST candidates, no legal infirmity can be ascribed to such a policy and the same cannot be held to be contrary to any provision of law.\" (Underlining added) In my considered view, the above observation in Pushpa's case is not a correct view. The judgment in Pushpa's case is contrary to the views taken in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao's case. The judgment in Pushpa's case is contrary to the views taken in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao's case. Facts of Pushpa’s case disclose that the Government of Pondicherry had throughout proceeded on the basis that being a Union Territory all orders regarding reservation for SC/ST in respect of post/services under the Central Government were applicable to post/services as under the Pondicherry administration. The decision in Pushpa’s case therefore cannot be taken to be an authoritative pronouncement. Clause (2) of Article 341 of the Constitution empowers Parliament alone by law to include or exclude from the lists of Scheduled Castes specified in a notification issued under clause (1) of Article 341. No executive action or order or modification or variance of the same is possible and any such variance would be against the constitutional scheme. 99 39. In Pushpa's case, the posts advertised were of Selection Grade Teachers under the Pondicherry Services and not for Central Government jobs. It may be that Pondicherry is a Union Territory; but the posts/services exclusively coming under Pondicherry administration is meant only for the Scheduled Casts/Scheduled Tribes as notified under the Presidential Order for Pondicherry. In fact, Pondicherry (Union Territory) itself by referring to Subhash Chandra's case has taken the decision that reservation benefits to posts/services arising under the Union Territory of Pondicherry will be confined only to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes notified by virtue of Presidential Order. The said Government Order of the Pondicherry Government was upheld by this Court in Puducherry Scheduled Caste People Welfare Association v. Chief Secretary to Government, Union Territory of Pondicherry and Ors. (2014) 9 SCC 236, wherein this Court held as under:- \"13. It is important to bear in mind that it is by virtue of the notification of President under Article 341(1) that the Scheduled Castes come into being. The members of the Scheduled Castes are drawn from castes, races or tribes, they attain a new status by virtue of Presidential Order. Clause (2) of Article 341 empowers Parliament alone by law to include or exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes specified in a notification issued under clause (1) by the President. By no executive power, amendment, modification, alteration or variance in the Presidential Order is permissible. It is not open to the executive to do anything directly or indirectly which may lead to any change in the Presidential Order. Once Presidential Order has been issued under Article 341(1) or Article 342(1), any amendment in the Presidential Order can only be made by Parliament by law as provided in Article 341(2) or Article 100 342(2), as the case may be, and in no other manner. The interpretation of “resident” in the Presidential Order as “of origin” amounts to altering the Presidential Order.\" 40. The principle in Pushpa's case was not accepted in Subhash Chandra's case. It was held that although Union Territory is administered by the Union Government, socio-political aspect of the Union Territory cannot be mixed up with administrative aspect. In Subhash Chandra's case, it was held that if the principle applied in Pushpa's case is to be given a logical extension, it will lead to an absurdity, that the Scheduled Castes Order in a State/Union Territory brought under the control of the President under Article 341 of the Constitution could be altered by virtue of a notification issued in pursuance of Article 16(4) of the Constitution, which is not in consonance with the Constitutional Scheme. 41. Let us refer to the facts of Chandigarh Administration and Another v. Surinder Kumar and Others (2004) 1 SCC 530. Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India issued various circulars pertaining to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The circular dated 22.02.1985 regarding \"Issue of Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe certificate to migrants from other States/Union Territories\", issued by the 101 Ministry of Home Affairs clarified that a Scheduled Caste/Tribe person who has migrated from the State of origin to some other State for the purpose of seeking education, employment, etc. will be deemed to be a Scheduled Caste/Tribe of the State of his origin and will be entitled to derive benefits from the State of origin and not from the State to which he has migrated. Based on the aforesaid circular of the Government of India, the Home Secretary, Chandigarh Administration vide his letter dated 28.07.1986 sought clarification from the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, as to whether, these instructions are applicable in the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Chandigarh Administration received the reply dated 26.08.1986 from Ministry of Welfare stating that there is no discrimination in the employment under the Central Government between the Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribes of one State or another and Union Territories and that the same may be followed by the Chandigarh Administration. The letter dated 26.08.1986 stated that Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes of any other State/Union Territory would be entitled to the benefits and facilities provided in the services under the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Further the said circular leaves it to the Chandigarh Administration to seek further clarification. The above letter of Government of India is in clear violation of Constitutional scheme. 102 42. Pursuant to the said letter, Chandigarh Administration sought clarification from the Department of Personnel and Training. However, they have not received any response. The clarification was issued by the Home Secretary, Chandigarh Administration vide letter dated 07.09.1999. The said letter had given a clarification based on the Government of India circular dated 02.02.1985 stating that a Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe of any other State or Union Territory would not be entitled to the benefits of reservation in the services in the Chandigarh Administration and that the benefit of reservation to persons belonging to reserved categories in other States in the Chandigarh Administration is to be discontinued with effect from 07.09.1999. In Chandigarh Administration case, the Supreme Court took the view that the stand taken by Chandigarh Administration discontinuing the benefits of reservation with effect from 07.09.1999 was untenable. With due respect, I am not in agreement with the view taken in Chandigarh Administration case . The letter dated 26.08.1986 sent by the Ministry of Welfare/Kalyan Mantralaya is contrary to the letter dated 22.02.1985 sent by the Ministry of Home Affairs and also against the Constitutional scheme. 103 43. It was held in Subhash Chandra that Chandigarh Administration and Pushpa proceeded on the basis that Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao and Action Committee would have no application in relation to Union Territories. Observing that both Articles 341 and 342 not only refer to the State but also to the Union Territory. In para (64) of Subhash Chandra's case, it was held as under:- \"64. Although Union Territories are administered by the Central Government, yet it is difficult to conceive that the socio-political aspect can be mixed up with the administrative aspect. Article 341 leads to grant of constitutional rights upon a person whose affinity to a caste/tribe would attract the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order or the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order. Once a person comes within the purview of presidential promulgation, he would be entitled to constitutional and other statutory or administrative benefits attached thereto. In our opinion, such socio-political rights created in our Constitution cannot be segregated keeping in view the administrative exigencies.” 44. As per the scheme of the Constitution under Articles 341, 342 and 239 of the Constitution, only those Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes as notified in the Presidential Notification for the respective Union Territory can legitimately claim the benefit of reservation in that Union Territory. Even though the Union Territories are centrally administered, though the administrator/Lieutenant Governor so far as the administrative aspects of the Union Territories, each Union Territory has its own identity. Each of the Union Territories would be bound by their 104 respective Presidential Order of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes for giving benefit of reservation to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in employment. Only those persons, who come within the purview of the Presidential Notification, would be entitled to constitutional and other statutory benefits of reservation in the respective Union Territory. If the benefit of reservation is to be extended to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes from all over the country then it would amount to inclusion of caste, races or tribes to the Presidential Order pertaining to that Union Territory. As discussed earlier, such inclusion or exclusion in the Presidential Order can be done only by the Parliament in the manner as indicated in Articles 341(2) and 342(2) of the Constitution of India. By no executive order, amendment, alteration or variance in the Presidential Order is permissible. Whether there can be PAN India reservation of SCs and STs to services under various Union Territories of India 45. Under Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 [CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965], there are four categories of services namely:- (i) Central Civil Services, Group A; (ii) Central Civil Services, Group B; (iii) Central Civil Services, Group C; and (iv) Central Civil Services, Group D 105 Central Civil Services – Group A:- 46. As per the Schedule to Central Civil Services (CCA) Rules, 1965, under Group ‘A’, there are forty five services inter alia like – (i) Archaeological Service (Serial No.1); (ii) Central Health Service (Serial No.5); (iii) Indian Defence Accounts Service (Serial No.11); (iv) Indian Foreign Service (Serial No.12); (v) Indian Meteorological Service (Serial No.13); (vi) Indian Postal Service (Serial No.14); (vii) Indian Posts and Telegraphs Traffic Service (Serial No.15); (viii) Indian Revenue Service (Serial No.16); (ix) Indian Salt Service (Serial No.17); (x) Directorate General of Mines Safety (Serial No.19); (xi) Indian Telecommunication Service (Serial No.22); (xii) Central Legal Service (Grades I,II, III and IV) (Serial No.25); (xiii) Delhi and Andaman and Nicobar Islands Civil Service, Grade I (DANICS) (Serial No.28); (xiv) Delhi and Andaman and Nicobar Islands Police Service, Grade II (DANIPS) (Serial No.29); (xv) Company Law Board Service (Serial No.38); (xvi) Labour Officers of the Central Pool (Serial No.39); and (xvii) Armed Forces Headquarters Civil Services (Serial No.44). 47. By reading of the categories of services, the said services of Group ‘A’ are concerned only with the services of the Union of India and the appointment to Group ‘A’ services are made by the President. The 106 Cadre Controlling Authority of Group ‘A’ services are the respective ministries of the Government of India. Recruitment to Group ‘A’ services is made by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and the recruitment is on all-India basis. So far as the recruitment to Group ‘A’ services is concerned, Union of India in its counter affidavit has stated as under:- “a. ……… Recruitment to Group A services is made by the UPSC. This recruitment is again on all India basis………… b. Whichever ministry seeks recruitment to the service in this Group sends requisition to UPSC as per procedure prescribed and UPSC accordingly advertises for the post in Group A. Every citizen of India is eligible to apply as per the qualifications and requirements in the notification. c. DoPT is the nodal ministry for regulating the conditions of service of all Central Civil Services as per Allocation of Business Rules. As per the conditions of service, every employee is required to give an undertaking agreeing to the conditions of the all India transfer liability at the time of joining the service. d. Central Civil Services employees belonging to Group A serve the Union of India and that is the reason why these services are across the length and breadth of the country, wherever there is an office of the Central Government. e. Member of the Group A service are governed by Central Civil Services (Class, Control & Appeal) Rules, 1965 as well as Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1972 & Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 and such other rules made by the central ministries.”27 Central Civil Services – Group B:- 48. Under Rule 5, the Central Civil Services – Group ‘B’ are specified in the Schedule and there are thirty-two such services mentioned. Some 27 Para No. 6(i) of the Counter Affidavit filed by the Union of India at Pg.

(Serial No.33) Accounts or Joint Controller General of Accounts in a Ministry or Department where there is no Chief Controller of Accounts Recruitment to Group ‘B’ services are conducted by the UPSC. The appointing authority to various Group ‘B’ services is the President of India/respective Ministries/respective Heads like Ministry of Home Affairs, Collector of Customs, Commissioner of Customs etc. 49. In Serial Nos. 28 and 29 of the Schedule, we have the Union Territories Service known as Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli Civil Services 109 (DANICS) and Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshdweep, Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli Police Services (DANIPS). In the counter affidavit filed by the Union of India, it is stated as under:- “a. …….DANICS/DANIPS officers are posted in Delhi, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshdweep, Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli. The recruitment to all the Union Territories for these Group B posts are common. They are also centralised and the appointing authority is none other than Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The recruitment to these services is the very same examination meant for the All India Services (IAS/IPS) on the one hand and the Central Civil Services Group A on the other. Any citizen of India is eligible to apply, subject to the conditions prescribed. As per service rules, transfer undertakings throughout the Union Territories covered under DANICS/DANIPS is taken from these officers. b. This is the reason why the Union of India while inviting applications for recruitment considers all candidates, including reserved candidates on all India basis. Group B cadre of DANICS and DANIPS is the feeder cadre for IAS and IPS respectively. They retire invariably in these offices, some of them reaching high positions in the central government. c. As indicated above recruitment to the All India Services, CCS Group A as well as CCS Group B (Gazetted) is conducted through UPSC in the Civil Services Examination, the applicants are common when the applications are made, every aspirant seeks recruitment to the services and it is only as per the marks and ranking that allocations are made eventually to All India Services, Group A and Group B. Therefore, when UPSC undertakes the recruitment, it is naturally a PAN India recruitment and therefore it is necessary to seek applications including from reserved candidates from all over India.”28 Central Civil Services – Group C:- 50. There are five services under Central Civil Services – Group ‘C’ under CCS (CCA) Rules. Some of the posts noted in Group ‘C’ and their appointing authorities are as under:- 28 Para No. 6(ii) of the Counter Affidavit filed by the Union of India at Pg. No.4-5 110 PART III - Central Civil Services, Group 'C' (Except for Civilians in Defence Services) Description of service (2) Appointing Authority (3) Description of service (2) Appointing Authority (3) Central Secretariat Clerical Service, Upper Division and Lower Division Grade (Serial No.1) Deputy Secretary or Director, Cadre Authority General Central Service, Group ‘C’ (Serial No.4) (i) Posts in the Ministry/Department of Government other than the posts in respect of which specific provision has been made by a general or special order of the President (ii) Posts in non-Secretariat Office other than posts in respect of which specific provision has been made by a general or special order of the President (iii) Posts in Union Territories (iv) All Group ‘C’ posts of the Departmentalized Accounts Office of the Government of India Deputy Secretary or Director in the Ministry/Department of Government Head of Office Head of Office of such other authority as may be specified by the Administrator. Controller of Accounts or Deputy Controller General of Accounts in a Ministry or Department where there is no Controller of Accounts. Insofar as Group ‘C’ services of Union of India are concerned, they are recruited by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) which is the recruiting agency under DoPT. Members of these services get promoted to CCS – Group ‘B’. In the counter affidavit filed by the Union of India, it is stated as under:- “a. ……Recruitment to posts in Group C arise out of requisition made by the concerned ministries all over India. These requisitions upon reaching the Staff Selection Commission are processed and 111 selection takes place and appointments are made. Even from these appointees undertaking for all India transfer liability is taken. As these are posts under Central Government and these employees are liable to be transferred anywhere in the country and the recruitment being centralised for all such posts in the country, it had been consistent policy of the Union of India to have PAN India eligibility. b. The posts in CCS Group C are in the subordinate services. The equivalent in the Union Territory of Delhi is the Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services (DASS) and the recruiting agency in the place of Staff Selection Commission is the Delhi Subordinate Service Selection Board (DSSSB). Members of Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services are the feeder cadre for Central Civil Services Group B (DANICS). It is for these reasons that the policy is consistently adopted.”29 Central Civil Services – Group D:- 51. Class IV employees now referred to as Multi-Tasking Staff (MTS) come under this category. Some of the posts noted in Group ‘D’ and their appointing authorities are as under:- PART IV - Central Civil Services, Group 'D' (Except for Civilians in Defence Services) Description of service (2) Appointing Authority (3) General Central Service, Group ‘D’ (Serial No.1) (i) Posts in Ministries or Departments of Government other than posts in respect of which specific provision has been made by a general or special order of the President. (ii) Posts in non-Secretariat Offices other than posts in respect of which specific provision has been made by a general or special order of the President. (iii) Posts in Union Territories (iv) All Group ‘D’ posts of the Departmentalized Accounts Offices of the Government of India Under Secretary Head of Office Head of Office or such other authority as may be specified by the Administrator Deputy Controller of Accounts or Assistant Controller General of Accounts in a Ministry or Department where there is no Deputy Controller of Accounts. 29 Para No. 6(iii) of the Counter Affidavit filed by the Union of India at Pg. No.5-6 112 52. As pointed out earlier, there is centralised recruitment conducted by UPSC for the Central Civil Services in Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’. For this centralised recruitment, applications are invited from candidates across the country and Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes of all the States/Union Territories are entitled to apply for the reserved posts. Recruitment to various posts in Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) categories for services in States/Union Territories are presently filled only through UPSC by centralised recruitment. After recruitment, the Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ officers are posted across the country wherever there are offices of Central Government. 53. Services mentioned at Serial No.28 that is Delhi and Andaman and Nicobar Islands Civil Service, Grade-II (DANICS) are Group ‘B’ civil services. DANICS officers are posted at Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. DANICS - Group ‘B’ civil service officers are directly recruited through the Central Civil Services examination conducted by UPSC. Since DANICS is a centralised recruitment conducted through UPSC naturally applications are invited from the candidates across the country including reserved candidates of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes. 113 54. Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Police Services (DANIPS) are recruited directly through centralised civil services examination conducted by UPSC. DANIPS are posted at Delhi and other Union Territories – Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep Islands, Daman and Diu and Dadar and Nagar Haveli. The cadre strength is controlled by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. Two-thirds of DANIPS are filled by direct recruitment and remaining are promoted from non-gazetted police officers of Union Territory of Delhi and other Union Territories. Since, DANIPS officers are recruited through a centralised recruitment conducted through UPSC, applications are invited from candidates from across the country including reserved candidates of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of all the States and Union Territories. Thus, up to Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) of Central Civil Services including the Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) services of Union Territories, there is Centralised Civil Services Examination conducted by UPSC with PAN INDIA reservation. 55. Serial No.32, Group ‘B’ of CCS (CCA) Rules refers to General Central Services. At the risk of repetition, we may usefully refer to Serial No.32 which reads as under:- Serial No. General Central Service, Group 'B'- 114 32 (i) Post in any Ministry of Department of Government of India, other than the post in respect of which specific provision has been made by a general or special order of the President. (i-a) Posts outside a Ministry or Department of Government of India, other than the posts in respect of which specific provision has been made by a general or special order of the president. (ii) Posts in Union Territories other than Delhi Administration, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindive Islands (iii) Delhi Administration-All posts (iv) The Andaman and Nicobar Islands-All Posts (v) The Lakshadweep Administration-All Posts Secretary in the Ministry or Department In respect of posts in an office under the control of a Head of Department directly under the Government. -Head of the Department In respect of other posts - Secretary in the Ministry or Department Administrator Chief Secretary Chief Commissioner Administrator As seen from the above, Serial No.32(i) and (i-a) relates to the posts under the Government of India for which the appointing authority is the Secretary in the Ministry or Department/Head of the Department respectively. Serial No.32 (ii) of Central Civil Services (CCA) Rules, 1965 relates to “Posts in Union Territories other than Delhi Administration, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindive Islands”. The appointing authority is shown to be the ‘Administrator’. Serial No.32 (iii) to (v) relate to ‘All posts’ in Delhi administration, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Lakshadweep administration respectively. Serial No.32(ii) posts in the Union Territories (other than Delhi Administration, the Andaman & 115 Nicobar Islands and the Laacadive, Minicoy and Amindive Islands) Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) posts for which recruitment is conducted by UPSC. Since there is centralised recruitment conducted by UPSC for Group ‘B’ (Gazetted), naturally applications are invited from the candidates across the country including reserved candidates of Scheduled Castes/Schedules Tribes from all the States/Union Territories. Up to the level of Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) of Central Civil Services, since there is centralised recruitment for which there is PAN INDIA reservation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes from any State/Union Territory are entitled to apply for the reserved posts for Group ‘B’ examinations conducted by UPSC. 56. When it comes to services under Union Territories, there are so many other services like teaching, clerical cadre, police services, Medical Officers, Health Services, Stenographers, Typists, services under the Revenue department, services under public-sector undertakings, services under the municipalities and the corporations in the Union Territories and various other services which are concerned with the administration of Union Territories. These services under the Union Territories would fall under Group ‘B’, Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ and 116 their recruitment is within the exclusive domain of the respective Union Territories. Though the government servants under the Union Territories are governed by Central Civil Services Rules, the services under the Union Territories are essentially different from All India Services. For recruitment to services under respective Union Territories, there are different modes of recruitment for the different Union Territories. 57. This Court posed the question whether there is other category of employees in UT administration and what is the practice followed for recruitment. In response to the question, Union of India, on instructions, filed the following response:- SCOPE OF SC/ST RESERVATION IN UTs 1. Puducherry : Reserved posts confined to local reserved candidates. 2. Chandigarh : Reserved posts filled up by candidates from all India. 3. Daman & Diu : Reserved posts confined to local reserved candidates for Group C posts. For Group B it is opened to candidates from all India but local candidates get additional 20 marks. 4. Dadra & Nagar Haveli : Reserved posts confined to local reserved candidates for Group C posts. For Group B it is opened to candidates from all India but local candidates get additional 20 marks. 5. Lakshadweep : Reserved posts confined to local reserved candidates. 6. A & N Islands : For Group C posts locally reserved. 7. NCT of Delhi : Reserved posts filled up by candidates from all India. 117 For the above response that there is PAN India reservation of the reserved candidates for recruitment by Union Territories of Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and NCT of Delhi, no authenticated documents were produced to substantiate the same. When there are Presidential Orders notifying the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes for Union Territories of Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, calling for application from the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates from all over India for the reserved posts of services under various Union Territories, be it Group ‘B’ or Group ‘C’, is not in accordance with the constitutional scheme. 58. For Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ posts falling within the services of the Union Territories, recruitment is made by the Staff Selection Board of respective Union Territories. For instance, let me refer to the Staff Selection Board of UT Administration of Daman and Diu whose home page reads as under:- “In exercise of the powers conferred by the provision of Article 239 of the Constitution of India, the Administrator of Daman & Diu is pleased to make following rules to regulate the method of recruitment to all Group ‘B’ and ‘C’ categories of posts under the Administration of Daman & Diu. It aims to “ensure a uniform and transparent process and procedures for recruitment of all Group ‘B’ and ‘C’ categories of posts under the Administration of Daman and Diu through an autonomous body, without disturbing the existing recruitment processes and procedures and for ensuring that cumulative outcome of the recruitment is to provide just and fair opportunities to all the candidates and for matters 118 connected therewith or incidental thereto30.” 59. In response to the question posed by the court, Union of India filed response affidavit stating that in Union Territories Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, for Group ‘B’, it is opened to candidates from all over India. Local candidates with domicile certificate get additional twenty per cent marks. Response filed by the Union of India that there is PAN India reservation for Group ‘B’ services of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, no authenticated documents/format of any application for Group ‘B’ posts conducted by Daman and Diu was produced before us. Even assuming that there is such PAN India reservation for recruitment of Group ‘B’ conducted by the Union Territory of Daman and Diu, when there are Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes as notified in the Presidential Order (Reorganisation Act, 1987 in respect of SCs/STs), there cannot be PAN India reservation as it is not in accordance with the constitutional scheme. 60. Pointing out that services in the Union Territories are different from All India Services and that the mode of recruitment are also different, in para (29) of Subhash Chandra and another v. Delhi Subordinate Service Selection Board and others (2009) 15 SCC 458, it was held 30 https://daman.nic.in/staff-selection-board-daman-diu.aspx#downloads (27.06.2018) 119 as under:- “29. Concededly, in respect of education or service, there exists a distinction between State Services and State-run institutions including the Union Territory Services and Union Territory-run institutions on the one hand, and the Central Civil Services and the institutions run by the Central Government on the other. Whereas in the case of the former, the reservation whether for admission or appointment in an institution and employment or appointment in the services or posts in a State or Union Territory must confine to the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as notified in the Presidential Orders but in respect of All India Services, Central Civil Services or admission to an institution run and founded by the Central Government, the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other reserved category candidates irrespective of their State for which they have been notified are entitled to the benefits thereof. It is not denied or disputed that services in the Union Territory is essentially different from All India Services. It is also beyond any controversy that machinery for recruitment is also different. Indisputably again, not only the conditions of recruitment but also conditions of service differ.” I am in full agreement with the view taken by Justice Sinha in Subhash Chandra case. 61. Rule 3 of Delhi Administration Subordinate Services (DASS) Rules, 1967 deals with constitution of services and its classification in Delhi Administration. As per Rule 3(3) of DASS Rules, the post in Grade-I, Class-II Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) and those in Grades II, III and IV shall be Central Civil Services Posts. But as noted earlier, as per Serial No.32 – General Central Service, Group ‘B’, insofar as Delhi Administration – All Posts (Serial No. 32 (iii)), the Appointing Authority is the Chief Secretary. The subordinate services in the 120 National Capital Territory of Delhi though “Central Civil Services”, they are neither All India Services nor services under Union of India so as to attract Pan India Reservation. 62. Even in the counter affidavit filed by the Union of India, by referring to Group ‘C’ services, it is stated that CCS – Group ‘C’ are in the subordinate services and there are equivalent services in the Union Territory of Delhi. For recruitment of other employees in the Union Territory of Delhi, there is Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services (DASS) and the recruiting agency is Delhi Subordinate Staff Selection Board (DSSSB). Members of Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services are stated to be the feeder cadre for Central Civil Services – Group ‘B’ (DANICS).31 Merely because members of Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services are the feeder category for DANICS, PAN India reservation cannot be extended to Delhi Subordinate Services or to services under various Union Territories. Likewise, merely because, DANICS and DANIPS (Serial Nos. 28 and 29 of Group ‘B’ Services) are the feeder category for IAS and IPS, it cannot be said that the Pan India Reservation is applicable to services under National Capital Territory of Delhi. 31 Para No. 6(iii) of the Counter Affidavit filed by the Union of India at Pg. No.6 121 63. So far as Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ posts falling under the services of the Union Territories, recruitment is done by the respective Staff Selection Board of respective Union Territories. Serial No.4 (iii) – ‘Posts in Union Territories’ of Group ‘C’ in CCS (CCA) Rules is shown and the appointing authority is stated as Head of the Office of such other authority as may be specified by the Administrator. Merely because the posts in the Union Territories and the appointing authority are shown in Group ‘C’ in CCS (CCA) Rules, that does not mean that those Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ posts are available for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of all the States/Union Territories. For recruitment of Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ posts of services under the respective Union Territories, since the examination is conducted by the respective Union Territories like Delhi Subordinate Staff Selection Board and other Union Territories Staff Selection Boards of respective Union Territories, reservation of posts of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes must be confined only to those Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes as notified in the Presidential Order of the respective Union Territories. For recruitment of Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ posts under various Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi, 122 there cannot be PAN INDIA reservation of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes, lest, it would defeat the very object of the Presidential Orders issued specifying the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes for respective Union Territories. 64. As pointed out earlier, services under the Union Territories though they are Central Government services, they are services under the respective Union Territories and not under the direct control of Union of India/different Ministries. Procedure for recruitment to the various posts for the services of Union Territories are different as followed by respective Union Territories. The persons appointed for the services of Union Territories might be governed by CCS (CCA) Rules; but they are employees of respective Union Territories. The appointing authorities are the authorities under the administration of Union Territories and not under the Ministries of Union of India. Central Civil Services are the services directly under Union of India. Contrarily, various services under the Union Territories are the services under the respective Union Territories. Such services under Union Territories cannot be said to be Central Civil Services that is services under Union of India to extend the benefit of PAN India reservation for recruitment to the services under 123 respective Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi. 65. In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of Article 341, the President issued the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Union Territories Order, 1951 in the Presidential Order specifying Scheduled Castes in relation to Delhi and the thirty-six castes/groups notified are as under:- Part 1 – Delhi Throughout the Union Territory Adi Dharmi 19. Kachhandha Agria 20. Kanjar or Giarah Aheria 21. Khatik Balal 22. Koli Banjara 23. Lalbegi Bawaria 24. Madri Bazigar 25. Mallah Bhangi 26. Mazhabi Bhil 27. Meghwal 10.

Dhanak or Dhanuk 31. Perna 14. Dhobi 32. Sansi or Bhedkut 15. Dom 33. Sapera 16. Gharrami 34. Sikligar 17. Julaha (Weaver) 35. Singiwala or Kalbelila 18. Karbirpanthi 36. Sirkiband 124 In relation to Delhi, there are thirty-six castes notified as Scheduled Castes in the Presidential Order. The members of the Scheduled Castes in Delhi are drawn from castes, races and by virtue of the Presidential Order pertaining to Delhi, they attain the status of the Scheduled Caste. In view of the Presidential Order issued for the Scheduled Castes to Delhi, only those Scheduled Castes can claim the benefit of reservation in the employment under the Union Territory of Delhi who are notified in the Presidential Order. Neither the Delhi Government nor the court can add any caste or group to the list of Scheduled Castes notified in the Presidential Order. Once a Presidential Order has been issued under Article 341(1) of the Constitution, any addition or deletion to the Presidential Order can only be made by the Parliament by law as provided under Article 341(2) and in no other manner. Merely because, Delhi Subordinate Services is a feeder category for DANICS, there cannot be Pan India Reservation of the SCs and STs for the services under Group ‘C’ and ‘D’ categories, for which recruitment are made by the Delhi Subordinate Staff Selection Board (DSSSB). 66. Likewise, the Presidential Order has notified the following Scheduled Castes for the Union Territory of Chandigarh, Daman and 125 Diu, Puducherry and Dadra and Nagar Haveli:- Part II – Chandigarh 1 . Adi Dharmi 1 9 . Khatik 2 . Bangali 2 0 . Kori or Koli 3 . Barar, Burar or Berar 2 1 . Marjia or Marecha 4 . Batwal, Barwala 2 2 . Mazhabi 5 . Bauria or Bawaria 2 3 . Megh 6 . Bazigar 2 4 . Nat 7 .

Vetriyan Paky 16. Puthirai Vannan The Schedule – Dadra and Nagar Haveli Bhangi 3. Mahar Chamar 4. Mahayavanshi 67. Let me take the case of Andaman & Nicobar Islands. The Constitution (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) Scheduled Tribes Order, 1959 has notified the following tribes or tribal communities who have been included in the Schedule for the Andaman & Nicobar Islands:- 127 The Schedule The Andamanese (including Chariar or Chari, Kora, Tabo or Bo, Yere, Kede, Bea Balawa, Bojigiyab, Juwai and Kol 4. Sentinelese Jarawas 5. The Nicoberese Onges 6. The Shompens When Andaman & Nicobar Islands is recruiting persons to the services of Group ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ under its administration, it has to necessarily follow the policy of recruiting members from amongst the Scheduled Tribes who are notified as Scheduled Tribes in the Presidential Notification for Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It will not be appropriate to extend the benefit of reservation to the SCs and STs from other States/Union Territories, lest it would deprive the notified Scheduled Tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 68. It may be that the candidates recruited by the respective Union Territories for Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ may become the feeder categories for further promotion in Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ of All India Services respectively in the Central Civil Services. The fact that the candidates who are recruited by the respective Union Territories become the feeder categories for further promotion in the Central Civil Services is not a ground for extending the benefit of all India reservation to the 128 Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes for the reserved posts in the respective Union Territories. Be it noted that the candidates recruited by the various State Governments under Group ‘A’ of respective State services become the feeder category for IAS and IPS. The persons recruited for Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ by the respective Union Territories stand on the same footing as that of the candidates so recruited by the various States where only the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes of the respective States can apply. 69. A letter dated 10.05.2013 by Special Secretary (Services) addressed to all the Secretaries/Heads of Departments of NCT of Delhi has been filed by the Union of India. The letter relates to the subject “Reservation policy to be followed with regard to SCs/STs in civil posts under GNCTD”. The said letter refers to the judgment in Pushpa’s case and states that the Ministry of Law and Justice has opined that the law declared by the Supreme Court in Pushpa’s case applies to the NCT of Delhi and that Pushpa’s case cannot be ignored. Relevant portion of the said letter reads as under:- “GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL CAPITAL TERRITORY OF DELHI (SERVICES DEPARTMENT BRANCH-IV) 7TH LEVEL, B-WING, DELHI SECRETARIAT, I.P. ESTATE, NEW DELHI – 110002 No. F. 19(6)/2012/S-IV/883 Dated: 10-05-2013 …… The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi follows the 129 guidelines and instructions issued by the Government of India from time to time in matters regarding reservation to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in recruitment to various civil posts in Government of Delhi. Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India, in the context of order dated 11.02.2005 of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in case titled S. Pushpa & Ors. Vs. Sivachanmugavelu & Ors. stated vide their letter dated 01.06.2005 that the matter has been examined in consultation with the Ministry of Law & Justice (Department of Legal Affairs). That the Ministry had opined that the law declared by the Supreme Court of India cited above, applies to the National Capital Territory of Delhi. This was accordingly conveyed to the departments vide this department’s letter No.F.16(73)/97-S-III/710 dated 30.06.2005, stating that all the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribe candidates irrespective of their nativity, are eligible for reservation to the civil posts under Govt. of NCT of Delhi, which are reserved for SC/ST candidates and appropriate action for recruitment may be taken accordingly. Subsequently, in view of order dated 04.08.2009 of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the matter of Sarv Rural & Urban Welfare Society vs. Union of India & Ors. and of the Hon’ble High Court dated 12.09.2012 in WP(C) No.5390/2010 under consideration in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India. Now, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India, vide its letter No.14012/09/2012-Delhi-I dated 03.04.2013 has informed that the subject matter has been re-examined in consultation with Ministry of Law & Justice. In this matter Learned Attorney General for India has given his opinion dated 18.02.2013 (copy enclosed), which is self-explanatory and has been approved by the Hon’ble Minister of Law & Justice, Govt. of India. The opinion, inter alia, states that having regard to the order in the State of Uttaranchal’s case, till this issue is resolved by a larger bench, the decision in S. Pushpa case cannot be ignored. Ministry of Home Affairs has conveyed that it has been decided to proceed according to this opinion. Copy of above mentioned letter of the Ministry of Home Affairs is circulated for information & necessary action accordingly. Yours faithfully, (Kailash Chandra) Spl. Secretary (Services) Dated: 10-05-2013 …..” 70. PAN India reservation probably is followed by NCT of Delhi in its recruitment based on the above letter dated 10.05.2013. Since I have taken the view that the decision in Pushpa’s case is not a correct decision extending PAN India reservation for the reserved posts recruited by NCT of Delhi or any other Union Territories is against the 130 Presidential Orders issued under Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India and against the constitutional scheme. 71. As discussed earlier in para (8), in case of Union Territories, though administrative control to certain extent is exercised by the Union of India, Union Territories do not lose their identity as an entity. The existing practice of PAN INDIA reservation followed in Delhi and Chandigarh is against the constitutional scheme and also against the executive instructions dated 06.08.1984 and 22.02.1985 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. 72. As pointed our earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs in its circular dated 06.08.1984 addressed to all the State Governments and Union Territories administration stated that SCs and STs on migration from the State of his origin to other State will not loose his status as SCs/STs; but will be entitled to the concession/benefits to the SCs/STs from the State of his origin and not from the State where he has migrated. The same thing was reiterated in the letter dated 22.02.1985 of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. If PAN India reservation is to be extended to the Union Territories like Delhi, Chandigarh, Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands or Daman & Diu for Group ‘C’ and ‘D’ 131 services for which recruitment are made by the respective Union Territories, the very object of the Constitutional Scheme of upliftment of the SCs/STs of these Union Territories will be defeated. All India reservation to the services under the Union Territories including the Union Territory of Delhi will be against the mandate of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution and against the Constitutional Scheme. 73. Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao and Action Committee are applicable to the States and they are applicable with equal force to the Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi. There cannot be any distinction between the States and the Union Territories. Likewise, there can be no distinction between Union Territory of Delhi and other Union Territories. When Presidential Orders of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes are notified for various Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi extending PAN India reservation to the employment falling under the services of Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi, will be against the Constitutional scheme and the law laid down in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao and Action Committee. 74. Article 16(4) of the Constitution has to yield to the constitutional mandate of Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution. 132 The Presidential Order issued under Article 341 in regard to Scheduled Castes and Article 342 in regard to Scheduled Tribes cannot be varied by anyone or by the Court. Only the Parliament by law include or exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes specified in the notification issued under Article 341 (1) and Article 342(1) respectively any caste, race or tribe or parts or group within any caste, race or tribe. The Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes thus specified in relation to one State or Union Territory does not carry the status in another State or Union Territory. When the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes are specified for each State in relation to one State or Union Territory, neither the State legislature, the administration of the Union Territories and nor the courts can include or exclude other Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes so notified in the Presidential Order. Providing all India reservation to the services of Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi, would be against the mandate of Articles 341 and 342 and the Presidential Orders issued thereon. If that is permitted, it would amount to addition or alteration of the Presidential Order which is impermissible and violative of the Constitutional Scheme. 75. It is the responsibility of each State/Union Territory to provide for such reservation/affirmative action by positive discretion to bring 133 backward classes/Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the respective States/areas to provide socio-economic empowerment. If the reservation to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are to be extended to all categories of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes all over India or to the migrants then there is every possibility of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of other developed States and Union Territories squandering reservations to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are disadvantaged in the respective States/Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi. If this is permitted, it would defeat the very object of providing reservation to the disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in a particular State or Union territory. The enabling provision of Article 16(4) of the Constitution has to yield to the constitutional scheme of Article 341 and Article 342 of the Constitution. 76. Conclusion:-  Insofar as the States, I agree with the majority view that a person who is recognised as a member of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in his original State, will be entitled to all the benefits of reservation under the Constitution in that State only and not in other 134 States/Union Territories and not entitled to the benefits of reservation in the migrated State/Union Territory.  Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao and Action Committee are applicable to the States and they are applicable with equal force to the Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi. There cannot be any distinction between the States and the Union Territories. Likewise, there can be no distinction between Union Territory of Delhi and other Union Territories. When Presidential Orders of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes are notified for various Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi extending PAN India reservation to the employment falling under the services of Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi, will be against the Constitutional scheme and the law laid down in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao and Action Committee.  Since there is centralised recruitment upto Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) services conducted by UPSC for the Central Civil Services posts in the States/Union Territories of India, there has to be necessarily PAN India reservation for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes for those 135 recruitment conducted by UPSC. Sofaras Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ posts falling under services of Union Territories including Union Territory of Delhi for which recruitment is conducted by the respective Union Territories, benefit of reservation in employment (Article 16(4)) is to be extended only to those Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes specified in the Presidential Order of the respective Union Territories. Insofar as the posts recruited by the Staff Selection Board of the respective Union Territories including the Union Territory of Delhi, there cannot be PAN India reservation for Group ‘B’, Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ posts falling under the services of various Union Territories and such PAN India reservation would be against the constitutional scheme and Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao and Action Committee. …………….……………J.
