The startling facts which we have narrated above clearly show that the executive in Bihar has almost taken over the role of the legislature in making laws, not for a limited period, but for years together in disregard of the constitutional limitations. This is clearly contrary to the constitu- tional scheme and it must be held to be improper and invalid. We hope and trust that such practice shall not be continued in the future and that whenever an ordinance is made and the government wishes to continue the provisions of the ordinance in force after the assembling of the legislature, a Bill will be brought before the legislature for enacting those provisions into an Act. There must not be Ordinance-Raj in the country. 9. We must accordingly strike down the Bihar Intermediate Education Council Ordinance, 1985 which is still in operation as unconstitutional and void.

This rule evolved in the 19th century at a time \"\"hen all the developments of science and technology had not taken place cannot afford any guidance in evolving any standard of liability consistent with the constitutional norms and the needs of the present day economy and social structure. In a modern industrial society with highly developed ~cienufic knowledge and technology where hazardous 01 inherently dangerous industries are necessary to be carried on as part of the developmental pro- gr,uume, Court should not feel inhibited by this rule merely because the new law does not 1ecognise the rule of strict and absolute liability in case of an enterprise engaged m hazardous and dangerous activity. (Para 31) Rylands v. Fletcher, (1868) LR 3 HL 330, distingui&hed Law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs of the fast-changing society and keep abreast with the economic developments taking place in the country. Law cannot afford to remain static. The Court cannot allow judicial thinking to be constricted by reference to the law as it prevails in England or in any other foreign country. Though the Court should be prepared to receive light from whatever source it comes but it has to build up its own jurisprudence. It has to evolve new principles and lay down new norms which would adequately deal with the new problems which arise in a highly industrialised economy. If it is found that it is necessary to construct a new principle of liability to deal with an unusual situation which has arisen and which is likely to arise in future on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous industries which are concomitant to an industrial economy, the Court should not hesitate to evolve such principle of liability merely because it has not been so done m England. (Para 31) An enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous indm,try which poses a potential threat to the health and safety of the persons working in the factory and residing in the surrounding areas owes an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to anyone. The enterprise must be held to be under an obligation to provide that the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity in which it is engaged must be conducted with the highest standards of safety and if any harm results to anyone on account of an accident in the operation o{ such activity resulting, for example, in escape of toxic gas the enterprise is strictly and absolutely liable to compensate all those who are affected by the accident as a part of the social cost for carrying on such activity, regardless of whether it is carried on carefully or not. Such liability is not subject to any of the exceptions which operate vis-a-vis the tortious principle of strict liability under the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher. If the enterprise is permitted to carry on a hazardous or inherently dangerous activity for its profit, the law must presume that such permission is conditional on the enterprise absorbing the cost of any accident arising on account of such activity as an appropriate items of its overheads. The enterprise alone has the resource to discover and guard against hazards or dangers and to provide warning against potential hazards.

(Para 1) While dealing with such applications, Court should not adopt a hyper- technical approach which would defeat the ends of justice. The applications for compensation had been made in this case for enforcement of right under Article 21 of persons affected by the oleum gas leak. Merely because the petitioner could not apply for amendment of the writ petition so as to include the claim for compensation the applications for compensation cannot be thrown out. The Court while dealing with an application for enforcement of a fundamental right must look at the substance and not the form. (Para 1) Bandhua Mukti Morcha v.

It was contended that Article 21 was available, as Shriram was carrying on an industry which, according to the government's own declared industrial policies, was ultimately intended to be carried out by itself, but instead of the government immediately embarking on that industry, Shriram was permitted to cany it on under the active control and regulation of the Government. Since the government intended to ultimately carry on this industry and the mode of carrying on the industry could vitally affect public interest, the control of the government was hnked to regulating that aspect of the functioning of the industry which could vitally affect public interest. Special emphasis was laid on the regulatory mechanisms provided under the Industries Development and Regulation Act, 1951 where industries are included in the schedule if they vitally affect public interest, as also under the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, the Air and Water Pollution Control Acts and the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

Prima facie, wl:'ten the State's power as economic agent, economic entrepreneur and allocator of economic benefits is subject to the limitations of fundamental rights, a private corporation under the functional control of the State engaged in an activity which is hazardous to the health and safety of the community and is imbued with public interest and which the 5tate ultimately proposes to exclusively run under its industrial policy, such as the fertiliser and chemical factory of Shriram, should not be subject to the same limitations. But it is not necessary to decide this question and to make any definite pronouncement upon it. (Paras 18 and 28) Ramana Dayaram Shetty v.

[Ed.: The above judgment of a Constitution Bench touches upon several important issues : (1) Having laid down that in the matter of Public Interest Litigation/ SAL even a letter addressed to any individual Justice can be entertained, the Court has mentioned that all such letters will be processed through the Public Interest Litigation Cell in the Supreme Court and after scrutiny placed before the Chief .Justice. The future of PIL/SAL then would considerably depend on the functioning of this cell. Attention must therefore be paid to the administrative structure and workin~ of a model PIL Cell with proper setting and inputs !\\O that similar cells could be opened in each High Court and there be uniform working amongst them. Legal aid cells can be encouraged to function as catalytic a~ents for PIL. (2) The Bench has ruled for award of compensation under Article 32 in specified appropriate cases and extended it beyond the cases involving wrongful arrest and detention like Bhim Singh, (1985) 4 SCC 677; Sebastian M. Hongray, (1984) 3 SCC 82 and Rudal Shah, (1983) 4 SCC 141. It shows the continuing concern of the Court for the socially and economically disadvantaged persons. As a further step the Court has considered, without finally d~ciding the question, whether a private corporation is covered by Article 32. If the stand point is that as far as the hapless helpless poor and disadvantaged are concerned it matters little if the defendant corporation is private or public, what justification remains for retaining the rule of sovereign immunity where the defendant is the State. The effect of the injury is the same regardless of the status of the person or authority by whose neglig-ence ( or their servant's) it was caused. In any case the doctrine of soverei~n immunity born of an imperialistic era is little suited for democratic socialist India.

Violation of Article 21 was apparently assumed or not contested and directions affecting the substantive rights of Shriram Industry were passed . The subsequent petition in (1986) 2 SCC 325 was not a review petition questioning the jurisdictional basis of the earlier order but merely one seeking clarification. Hence as such Article 32 was in fact exercised against a private corporation. It is a moot question whether by ruling that this question is bein~ left oper1 the present five judge bench has overruled the exercise of Article 32 against a private corporation by the three judge bench in ( 1986) 2 SCC 176. (4) The Court has stated that the purport to include private corpora- tions in Article 12 and have the matter decided within the original jurisdiction of Article 32 is to subject the activity of such private corporations \"to the limitations of fundamental rights'' and \"to inject respect for human rights and social conscience in our corporate structure\" thereby to \"advance human rights jurisprudence\". Can one read from this and the rest of the judgment that in \"appropriate casf's\" the entire matter involving complex questions of fact, liability, damages and compensation would be decided by the Supreme Court in its original jurisdiction as a trial Court? While damage to life and liberty would be covered bv Article 21 what about connected cases involving damage to property alone for which the right to property is no longer fundamental? Since the number of victims would be large the question of award of compensation to each in relation to the pecularities of the injury suffered by him will have to be decided. The Supreme Court may set up a sprcial machinery for such claims but eventually it will have to oversee and decide the claims. While for a tribunal there is a mass of case- law Indian and foreign on Iiability/damagrs/compensation, there are hardly any precrdents of itself for the Supreme Court of India to follow and so detailed principies would have to be innovated and applied in the first major case itself. Despite the well known backlog of cases at the Supreme Court all such cases will have to be given priority and decided immediately. But the Court must seriously consider the question of logistics. The place of mishap may not be near the seat of the Supreme Court or any of the High Courts. From far flung areas how wi11 the victims effectively reach the superior Courts and consult counsel at such Courts. Already the move is to decentralise justice and take it to the door steps of the victims through Lok Adalats etc. And if as against constitutional remedies, the normal statutory remedirs and common law remedies available at district Court levd are really found inadequate to deal with such cases , as a Ion~ term policy should not the further development of such remedies be informed and inspired by the provisions of the Comtitution so that human rights jurisprudence may operate and flourish at grass root level. In the preceding judgment in this case, ( 1986) 2 SCC 176, Bhagwati, C.J. had himself appointed the Chief Metropolitan M a~strate before whom claims for compensation may be filed (SCC p. 118); and in future cases the District Judge, Delhi to determine the compensation (SCC p. 200) and he even suggested the setting up of Environment Courts on regional basis with professional judge and exprrts and the matter to come to the Supreme Court only by way of appeal (SCC p. 202). {5) The Court has taken a bold step in laying down the principle of liability for industries engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities.

UNION OF INDIA (Bhagwati, C.J.) 403 the freedom to choose the workers to run such an industry and the expecta- tion of an equally responsible functioning of regulatory government agencies. Necessarily thr- working of even the most sophisticated and carefully designed industrial plant eventually depends on the vigilance and care of the workers operating it. Therefore a free hand will have to be afforded to the management of such industries in the matters of selection and in exercise of discretion to dispense with services of employees it does not find responsible enough or looses confidence in. What this means is a special labour law jurisprudence in respect of hazardous and inherently dangerous industries. Moreover all government agencies and inspectorates that carry out routine inspections and certify worthiness and fitness of an industrial plant must necessarily be held liable for criminal negligence for their acts of commission and omission if a mishap occurs. The expenditure of public money on their expert inspections is meaningless and their reports suicidal for the public if they are not reliable enough and lull any management to think all is well. The exception would be where the inherent and possible dangers of the process are kept secret by the management or are not fully disclosed to the licensing or regulatory agencies. What has been enunciated in this case is truly a rule of accountability and so must extend to its logical conclusion to include others on whom any management would necessarily rely upon to run the industry . (6) Can the considered opinion of the Court on the above matter of liability be regarded as obiter and therefore not binding. Going by the past practice and the precedents, the considered opinions of the Supreme Court have been regarded as binding both by the Supreme Court itself and by the High Courts. The above question of liability in this case was ''seriously debated\" and hence the rule laid down must be considered as binding law within Article 141. It is interesting to re-read Marbury v . .Nladison, the celebrated case on judicial review, as to what was the question for decision and what the judgment laid down and is considered an authority for.

The reference was made because certain questions of seminal importance and high constitutional significance were raised in the course of arguments when the writ petition was originally heard. The facts giving rise to the writ petition and the subsequent events have been set out in some detail in the judgment given by the Bench of three Judges on February 17, 19861, and it is therefore not necessary to reiterate the same.

That would have ordinarily put an end to the main controversy raised in the writ petition which was filed in order to obtain a direction for closure of the various units of Shriram on the ground that they were hazardous to the community and the only point in dispute which would have survived would have been whether the units of Shriram should be directed to be removed from the place where they are presently situate and relocated in another place where there would not be much human habitation so that there would not be any real danger to the health and safety of the people. But while the writ petition was pending there was escape of oleum gas from one of the units of Shriram on December 4 and 6, 1985 and applications were filed by the Delhi Legal Aid and Advice Board and the Delhi Bar Association for award of compensation to the persons who had suffered harm on account of escape of oleum gas. These applications for compensation raised a number of issues of great constitutional importance and the Bench of three Judges therefore formulated these issues and asked the petitioner and those supporting him as also Shriram to file their respective written sub- missions so that the court could take up the hearing of these applica- tions for compensation. When these applications for compensation came up for hearing it was felt that since the issues raised involved substantial questions of law relating to the interpretation of Articles 21 and 32 of the Constitution, the case should be referred to a larger Bench of five Judges and this is how the case bas now come before us. 2. Mr Divan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Shriram raised a preliminary obiection that the court should not proceed to decide these constitutional issues since there was no claim for com- pensation originally made in the writ petition and these issues could not be said to arise on the writ petition. Mr Divan conceded that the escape of oleum gas took place subsequent to the filing of the writ petition but his argument was that the petitioner could have applied for amendment of the writ petition so as to include a claim for compensation for the victims of oleum gas but no such applica- tion for amendment was made and hence on the writ petition as it stood, these constitutional issues did not arise for consideration. We do not think this preliminary objection raised by Mr Divan is sustain- able. It is undoubtedly true that the petitioner could have applied for amendment of the writ petition so as to include a claim for com- pensation but merely because he did not do so, the applications for compensation made by the Delhi Legal Aid and Advice Board and the Delhi Bar Association cannot be thrown out.

UNION OF INDIA (Bhagwati, C.J.) 405 for compensation are for enforcement of the fundamental right to life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution and while dealing with such applications, we cannot adopt a hyper-technical approach which would defeat the ends of justice. This Court has on numerous occasions pointed out that where there is a violation of a fundamental or other legal right of a person or class of persons who by reason of poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position cannot approach a court of law tor Justice, it would be open to any public spirited individual or social action group to bring an action tor vindication of the fundamental or other legal right of such individual or class of individuals and this can be done not only by filing a regular writ petition but also by addressing a letter to the court. If this Court is prepared to accept a letter complaining of violation of the fundamental right of an individual or a class of individuals who cannot approach the court for justice, there is no reason why these applications for compensation which have been made for enforce- ment of the fundamental right of the persons affected by the oleum gas leak under Article 21 should not be entertained. The court while dealing with an application for enforcement of a fundamental right must look at the substance and not the form. We cannot therefore sustain the preliminary objection raised by Mr Divan. 3. The first question which requires to be considered is as to what is the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 since the applications for compensation made by the Delhi Legal Aid and Advice Board and the Delhi Bar Association are applications sought to be maintained under that article. We have already had occasion to consider the ambit and coverage of Article 32 in the Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India2 and we wholly endorse what has been stated by one of us namely, Bhagwati, J. as he then was in his judgment in that case in regard to the true scope and ambit of that article. It may now be taken as well settled that Article J2 docs not merely confer power on this Court to issue a direction, order or writ for enforcement of the fundamental rights but it also lays a constitut1onal obJJgation on this Court to protect the fundamental rights of the people and for that purpose this Court has all incidental and ancillary powers including the power to forge new remedies and fashion new strategies designed to enforce the fundamental rights. It is in realisation of this constitutional obliga- tion that thi~ Court has in the past innovated new methods and strategies for the purpose of securing enforcement of the fundamental nghts, particularly in the case of the poor and the disadvantaged who are denied their basic httman rights and to whom freedom and liberty have no meaning. 2.

Union of India8 that this Court held that (SCC p. 210, para 17) where a legal wrong or a legal injury is caused to a person or to a determinate class of persons by reason of violation of any constitutional or legal right or any burden is imposed in con- travention of any constitutional or legal provision or without authority of law or any such legal wrong or legal injury or illegal burden is threatened and such person or determinate class of persons is by reason of poverty, helplessness or disability on socially or economically disadvantaged position, unable to approach the court for relief, any member of the public or social action group can maintain an application for an appropriate direction, order or writ in the High Court under Article 226 and in case of breach of any fundamental right of such person or class of persons, in this Court under Article 32 seeking judicial redress for the legal wrong or injury caused to such person or determinate class of persons. This Court also held in S.P. Gupta casea as also in the PUDR v. Union of India4 and in Bandhua Mukti Morcha case2 that procedure being merely a hand-maiden of justice it should not stand in the way of access to justice to the weaker sections of Indian humanity and there- fore where the poor and the disadvantaged are concerned who are barely eking out a miserable existence with their sweat and toil and who are victims of an exploited society without any access to justice, this Court will not insist on a regular writ petition and even a letter addressed by a public spirited individual or a social action group acting pro bono publico would suffice to ignite the jurisdiction of this Court. We wholly endorse this statement of the law in regard to the broaden- ing of locus standi and what has come to be known as epistolary jurisdiction. S. We may point out at this stage that in Bandhua Mukti Morcha case2 some of us apprehending that letters addressed to individual justices may involve the court in frivolous cases and that possibly a view could be taken that such letters do not invoke the jurisdiction of the court as a whole, observed that such letters should not be addressed to individual justices of the court but to the court or to the Chief Justice and his companion judges. We do not think that it would be right to reject a letter addressed to an individual justice of the court merely on the ground that it is not addressed to the court or to the Chief Justice and his companion judges. \\Ve must not forget that letters would ordinarily be addressed by poor and 3. 1981 Supp SCC 87 4.

They may know only a particular judge who comes from their State and they may therefore address the letters to him. If the court were to insist that the letters must be addressed to the court or to the Chief Justice and his companion judge'i, it would exclude from the judicial ken a large number of letters and in the result, deny access to justice to the deprived and vulnerable sections of the community. We are therefore of the view that even if a letter is addre~sed to an individual judge of the court, it should be entertained, provided of course it is by or on behalf of a person in custody or on behalt of a woman or a child or a class of deprived or disadvantaged persons. We may point out that now there is no difficulty in entertaining letters addressed to individual justices of the court, because this Court has a Public Interest Litigation Cell to which all letters addressed to the court or to the individual justices are forwarded and the staff attached to this cell examines the letters and it is only after scrutiny by the staff members attached to this cell that the letters are placed before the Chief Justice and under his direction, they are listed before the court. We must therefore hold that letters addressed to individual justices of the court should not be rejected merely because they fail to conform to the preferred form of address. Nor should the court adopt a rigid stance that no letters will be entertained unless they are supported by an affidavit. If the court were to insist on an affidavit as a condition of entertaining the letters the entire object and purpose of epistolary jurisdiction would be frustrated because most of the poor and disadvantaged persons will then not be able to have easy access to the court and even the social action groups will find it difficult to approach the court. We may point out that the court has so far been entertaining letters without an affidavit and it is only in a few rare cases that it has been found that the allega- tions made in the letters were false. But that might happen also in cases where the jurisdiction of the court is invoked in a regular way. 6. So far as the power of the court under Article 32 to gather relevant material bearing on the issues arising in this kind of litiga- tion, which we may for the sake of convenience call social action litigation, and to appoint Commissions for this purpose is concerned, we endorse what one of us namely, Bhagwati, J. as he then was, has said in his judgment in Bandhua Mukti Morcha case2 • We need not repeat what has been stated in that judgment. It has our full approval. 7.

The power of the court is not only injunctive in ambit, that is, preventing the infringement of a fundamental right, but it is also remedial in scope and provides relief against a breach of the fundamental right already committed vide Bandhua Mukti Morcha case2 • If the court were powerless to issue any direction, order or writ in cases where a tundamental right has already been violated, Article 32 would be robbed of all its efficacy, because then the situation would be that if a fundamental right is threatened to be violated, the court can injunct such violation but if the violator is quick enough to take action infringing the fundamental right, he would escape from the net of Article 32. That would, to a large extent, emasculate the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 32 and render it impotent and futile. We must, therefore, hold that Article J 2 is not powerless to assist a person when he finds that his fundamental right has been violated. He can in that event seek remedial assistance under Article 32. The power of the court to grant such remedial relief may include the power to award compensation in appropriate cases. We are deliberately using the words •'in appropriate cases\" because we must make it clear that it is not in every case where there is a breach of a fundamental right committed by the violator that com- pensation would be awarded by the court in a petition under Article 32. The infringement of the fundamental right must be gross and patent, that is, incontrovertible and ex f acie glaring and either such infringe- ment should be on a large scale affectmg the fundamental rights of a large number of persons, or it should appear unjust or unduly harsh or oppressive on account of their poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position to require the person or persons affected by such infringement to initiate and pursue action in the civil courts. Ordinarily, of c,:>urse, a petition under Article 32 should not be used as a substitute for enforcement of the right to claim compensation for infringement of a fundamental right through the ordinary process of civil court. It is only in exceptional cases of the nature indicated by us above, that compensation may be awarded in a petition under Article 32. This is the principle on which this Court awarded compensation in Rudul Shah v. State of Bihar. So also, this Court awarded compensation to Bhim Singh, whose fundamental right to personal liberty was grossly violated by the State of J ammu and Kashmir0 • If we make a fact analysis of the cases where compensation has been awarded by this Court, we will find that in all the cases, the fact of infringement was patent and incon- trovertible, the violation was gross and its magnitude was such as s.

The next question which arises for consideration on these applications for compensation is whether Article 21 is available against Shriram which is owned by Delhi Cloth Mills Limited, a public company limited by shares and which is engaged in an industry vital to public interest and with potential to affect the life and health of the people. The issue of availability of Article 21 against a private corporation engaged in an activity which has potential to affect the life and health of the people was vehemently argued by counsel for the applicants and Shriram. It was emphatically contended by counsel for the applicants, with the analogical aid of the American doctrine of State Action and the functional and control test enunciated by this Court in its earlier decisions, that Article 21 was available, as Shriram was carrying on an industry which, according to the government's own declared industrial policies, was ultimately intended to be carried out by itself, but instead of the government immediately embarking on that industry, Shriram was permitted to carry it on under the active control and regulation of the government. Since the govern- ment intended to ultimately carry on this industry and the mode of carrying on the industry could vitally affect public interest, the control of the government was linked to regulating that aspect of the functioning of the industry which could vitally affect public interest. Special emphasis was laid ·by counsel for the applicants on the regulatory mechanism provided under the Industries Develop- ment and Regulation Act, 1951 where industries are included in the schedule if they vitally affect public interest. Regulatory measures are also to be found in the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, the Air and Water Pollution Control Acts and now the recent Environment Protection Act, 1986. Counsel for the applicants also pointed to us the sizeable aid in loans, land and other facilities granted by the government to Shriram in carrying on the industry. Taking aid of the American State Action doctrine, it was also argued before us on behalf of the applicants that private activity, if supported, controlled or regulated by the State may get so entwined with governmental activity as to be termed State action and it would then be subject to the same constitutional restraints on the exercise of power as the State. 9. On the other hand, counsel for Shriram cautioned against expanding Article 12 so as to bring within its ambit private corpora- tions. He contended that control or regulation of a private cor- poration's functions by the State under general statutory law such as the Industries Development and Regulation Act, 1951 is only in exercise of police power of regulation by the State.

The activity remains that of the private corporation ; the State in its police power only regulates the manner in which it is to be carried on. It was emphasised that control which deems a cor- poration, an agency of the State, must be of the type where the State controls the management policies of the Corporation, whether by sizeable representation on the board of management or by necessity of prior approval of the government before any new policy of management is adopted, or by any other mechanism. Counsel for Shriram also pointed out the inappositeness of the State action doctrine to the Indian situation. He said that in India the control and function test have been evolved in order to determine whether a particular authority is an instrumentality or agency of the State and hence 'other authority' within the meaning of Article 12. Once an authority is deemed to be 'other authority' under Article 12, it is State for the purpose of all its activities and functions and the American functional dichotomy by which some functions of an authority can be termed State action and others private action, cannot operate here. The learned counsel also pointed out that those rights which are specifically intended by the Constitution makers to be available against private parties are so provided in the Constitution specifically such as Articles 17, 23 and 24. Therefore, to so expand Article 12 as to bring within its ambit even private corporations would be against the scheme of the chapter on fundamental rights. 10. In order to deal with these rival contentions we think it is necessary that we should trace that part of the development of Article 12 v.-here this Court embarked on the path of evolving criteria by which a corporation could be termed 'other authority' under Article 12. ,11. In Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Mohan Lal1 this Court was called upon to consider whether the Rajasthan Electricity Board was an 'authority' within the meaning of the expression 'other authorities' in Article 12. Bhargava, J. who delivered the judgment of the majority pointed out that the expression 'other authorities' in Article 12 would include aU constitutional and statutory authorities on whom powers are conferred by law. The learned Judge also said that if any body of persons has authority to issue directions, the dis- obedience of which would be punishable as a criminal offence, that would be an indication that the concerned authority is 'State'. Shah, J ., who delivered a separate judgment agreeing with the con- clusion reached by the majority, preferred to give a slightly different meaning to the expression 'other authorities'. He said that authorities, constitutional or statutory, would fall within the expression \"other 7.

UNION OF INDIA (Bhagwati, C.J.) 411 authorities\" only if they are invested with the sovereign power of the State, namely, the power to make rules and regulations which have the force of law. The ratio of this decision may thus be stated to be that a constitutional or statutory authority would be within the expression \"other authorities\" if it has been invested with statutory power to issue binding directions to third parties, the disobedience of which would entail penal consequences or it has the sovereign power to make rules and regulations having the force of law . .12. This test was followed by Ray, C.J., in Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagatram8 • Mathew, J., however, in the same case propounded a broader test. The learned Judge emphasised that the concept of 'State' had undergone drastic changes in recent years and today 'State' could not be conceived of simply as a coercive machinery wielding the thunder- bolt of authority ; rather it has to be viewed mainly as a service corporation. He expanded on this dictum by stating that the emerging principle appears to be that a public corporation being an instru- mentality or agency of the 'State' is subject to the same constitutional limitations as the 'State' itself. The preconditions of this are two, namely, that the corporation is the creation of the 'State' and that there is existence of powe; in the corporation to invade the constitu- tional rights of the individual. This Court in Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airports Authority of Indiaci accepted and adopted the rationale of instrumentality or agency of State put forward by Mathew, J., and spelt out certain criteria with whose aid such an inference could be made. However, before we come to these criteria we think it necessary to refer to the concern operating behind the exposition of the broader test by Justice Mathew which is of equal relevance to us today, especially considering the fact that the definition under Article 12 is an inclusive and not an exhaustive definition. That concern is the need to curb arbitrary and unregulated power wherever and howsoever reposed. 13. In R.D. Shetty v. International Airports Authority9 this Court deliberating on the criteria on the basis of which to determine whether a corporation is acting as instrumentality or agency of government said that it was not possible to formulate an all inclusive or exhaustive test which would adequately answer this question. There is no cut and dried formula which would provide the correct division of cor- porations into those which are instrumentalities or agencies of govern- ment and those which are not. The court said whilst formulating the criteria that analogical aid can be taken from the concept of State Action as developed in the United States wherein the US courts have 8. (1975) 1 sec 421 9.

It was pointed out that the State's general common law and statutory structure under which its people carry on their private affairs, own property and enter into contracts, each enjoying equality in terms of legal capacity, is not such assistance as would transform. private conduct into State Action. \"But if extensive and unusual financial assistance is given and the purpose of the government in giving such assistance coincides with the purpose for which the cor- poration is expected to use the assistance and such purpose is of public character, it may be a relevant circumstance supporting an inference that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the government.\" (SCC p. 508, para 15) 14. On the question of State control, the court in R.D. Shetty case9 clarified that some control by the State would not be deter- minative of the question, since the State has considerable measure of control under its police power over all types of business organisations. But a finding of State financial support plus an unusual degree of control over the management and policies of the corporation might lead to the characterisation of the operation as State Action. 15. Whilst deliberating on the functional criteria namely, that the corporation is carrying out a governmental function, the court emphasised that classification of a function as governmental should not be done on earlier day perceptions but on what the State today views as an indispensable part of its activities, for the State may deem it as essential to its economy that it own and operate a railroad, a mill or an irrigation system as it does to own and operate bridges, street lights or a sewage disposal plant. The Court also reiterated in R.D. Shetty case'H what was pointed out by Mathew, J. in Sukhdev v. Bhagatram 8 that \"institutions engaged in matters of high public interest or performing public functions are by virtue of the nature of the functions pertormed government agencies.

The criteria evolved by this Court in R.D. Shetty case9 were applied by this Court in Aiay H asia v. Khalid Mujib10 where it was further emphasised that: (SCC pp. 731-32, para 7) Where constitutional fundamentals vital to the maintenance of human rights are at stake, functional realism and not facial cosmetics must be the diagnostic tool, for constitutional law must seek the substance and not the form. Now it is obvious that the government may act through the instrumentality or agency of natural persons or it may employ the instrumentality or agency of juridical persons to carry out its functions. . . . It is really the government which acts through the instrumentality or agency of the corporation and the juristic veil of corporate personality worn for the purpose of convenience of management and adminis- tration cannot be allowed to obliterate the true nature of the reality behind which is the government. ..

On the canon of construction to be adopted for interpreting constitu- tional guarantees the Court pointed out : (SCC p. 733, para 7) ... constitutional guarantees ... should not be allowed to be emasculated in their application by a narrow and constricted judicial interpretation. The courts should be anxious to enlarge the scope and width of the Fundamental Rights by bringing within their sweep every authority which is an instrumentality or agency of the government or through the corporate personality of which the government is acting, so as to subject the government in all its myriad activities, whether through natural persons or through corporate entities, to the basic obligation of the Fundamental Rights. In this case the court also set at rest the controversy a~ to whether the manner in which a corporation is brought into existence had any relevance to the question whether it is a State instrumentality or agency. The Court said that it is immaterial for the purpose of determining whether a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the State or rn.

The corporation may be a statutory corporation created by a statute or it may be a government company or a company formed under the Companies Act, 1956 or it may be a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other similar statute. It would come within the ambit of Article 12, if it is found to an instrumentality or agency of the State on a proper assessment of the relevant factors . .18. It will thus be seen that this Court has not permitted the corporate device to be utilised as a barrier ousting the constitutional control of the fundamenta] rights. Rather the Court has held : 11 (SCC p. 480, para 55) It is dangerous to exonerate corporations from the need to have constitutional conscience ~ and so, that interpretation, language permitting, which makes governmental agencies, whatever their mien amenable to constitutional limitations must be adopted by the court as against the alternative of permitting them to flourish as an imperium in imperio . .19. Taking the above exposition as our guideline, we must now proceed to examine whether a private corporation such as Shriram comes within the ambit of Article 12 so as to be amenable to the discipline of Article 21. 20. In order to assess the functional role allocated to private cor- poration engaged in the manufacture of chemicals and fertilisers, we need to examine the Industrial policy of the government and see the public interest importance given by the State to the activity carried on by such private corporation. 21. Under the Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956 industries were classified into three categories having regard to the part which the State would play in each of them. The first category was to be the exclusive responsibility of the State. The second category comprised those industries which would be progressively State owned and in which the State would therefore generally take the initiative in establish- ing new undertakings but in which private enterprise would also be expected to supplement the effort of the State by promoting and developing undertakings either on its own or with State participation. 11.

UNION OF INDIA (Bhagwati, C.J.) 415 The third category would include all the remaining industries and their future development would generally be left to the initiative and enterprise of the private sector. Schedule B to the Resolution enumerated the industries. 22. Appendix I to the Industrial Policy Resolution, 1948 dealing with the problem of State participation in industry and the conditions in which private enterprise should be allowed to operate stated that there can be no doubt that the State must play a progressively active role in the development of industries. However under the present conditions, the mechanism and resources of the State may not permit it to function forthwith in industry as widely as may be desirable. The policy declared that for some time to come, the State could contribute more quickly to the increase of national wealth by expand- ing its present activities wherever it is alread1 operating and by concentrating on new units of production in other fields. 23. On these considerations the government decided that the manufacture of arms and ammunition, the production and control of atomic energy and the ownership and management of railway transport would be the exclusive monopoly of the Central Government. The establishment of a new undertakings in coal, iron and steel, aircraft manufacture, ship-building, manufacture of telephone, telegraph and wireless apparatus and mineral oils were to be the exclusive responsibility of the State except where in national interest the State itself finds it necessary to secure the co-operation of private enterprise subject to control of the Central Government. 24. The policy resolution also made mention of certain basic industries of importance the planning and regulation of which by the Central Government was found necessary in national interest. Among the eighteen industries so mentioned as requiring such Central control, heavy chemicals and fertilisers stood included. 25. In order to carry out the objt.ctive of the Policy Resolution the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act of 1951 was enacted which, according to its objects and reasons, brought under Central control the development and regulation of a number of important industries the activities of which affect the country as a whole and the development of which must be governed by economic factors of all India import. Section 2 of the Act declares that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the industries specified in the First Schedule. Chemicals and Fertilisers find a place in the First Schedule as items 19 and 18 respectively. 26.

The argument of the applicants on the basis of this premise was that in view of this declared industrial policy of the State, even private corporations manufacturing chemicals and fertilisers can be said to be engaged in activities which are so fundamental to the society as to be necec;sarily considered government functions. (Sukhdev v. Bhagatram 8 , R .D. Shetty9 and Ajay Hasia10.) 27. It was pointed out on behalf of the applicants that as Shriram is registered under the Industries Development and Regulation Act, 1951 , its activities are su biect to extensive and detailed control and supervision by the j!OVernment. Under the Act a licence is necessary for the ec;tablishment of a new industrial undertaking or expansion of canacity or manufacture of a new article bv an existinf! industrial undertaking carrving on anv of the scheduled industries included in the First Schedule of the Act. By refusing licence for a particular unit, the r-ovemment can prevent over concentration in a particular re2:ion or over-investment in a particular industry. Moreover, by its power to specify the capacity in the licence it can also prevent over- deve]ooment of a particular industry if it has already reached target capacity. Section 18-G of the Act empowers the Government to control the sunnlv, distribution, price etc. of the articles manufactured by a scheduled industry and under Section 18-A government can assume management and control of an industrial undertaking en!?aged in a scheduled industry if after investi2:ation it is found that the affairs of the undertaking are being managed in a manner detrimental to public interest and under Section 18-AA in certain emer2:ent cases, takeover is allowed even without investigation. Since Shriram is carrving on a scheduled industrv. it is subiect to this strin~ent system of registration and liceming. It is also amenable to various directions that may be issued by the !!overnment from time to time and it is subiect to the exercise of the powers of the government under Sectionc; 18-A. 18-AA and 18-G. 28. Shriram is required to obtain a licence under the Factories Act and is subiect to the directions and orders of the authorities under the Act. It is also required to obtain a licence for its manufacturing activities from the Municipal authorities under the Delhi Municipal Act, 1957. It is subject to extensive environment regulation under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and as the factory is situated in an air pollution control area, it is alc;o subject ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It is true that control is not exercised by the government in relation to the internal management policies of the company. However, the control is exercised on an such activities of Shriram which can jeopardize public interest. This functional control is of special significance as it is the potentiality of the fertilizer industry to adversely affect the health and safety of the community and its being impregnated with public interest which perhaps dictated the policy decision of the government to ultimately operate this industry exclusively and invited functional control. Along with this extensive functional control, we find that Shriram also receives sizeable assistance in the shape of loans and overdrafts running into several crores of rupees from the f?:Ovemment through various agencies. Moreover, Shriram is engaged in the manufacture of caustic soda, chlorine etc. Its various units are set up in a single complex surrounded by thickly populated colonies. Chlorine gas is admittedly dangerous to life and health. If the gas escapes either from the storage tank or from the filled cylinders or from any other point in the course of production, the health and well-being of the people living in the vicinity can be seriously affected. Thus Shriram is engaged in an activity which has the potential to invade the right to life of large sections of people. The question is whether these factors are cumulatively sufficient to bring Shriram within the ambit of Artic1e 12. Prima facie it is arguable that when the State's power as economic agent, economic entrepreneur and allocator of economic benefits is subiect to the limitations of fundamental rights. (Vide Eurasian EQuinment and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of W.B .12 ; Rashbihari Panda v. State of Orisso13 : R.D. Shetty v. International Airports Authoritv9 anrl Knsturi Lal Reddv v .

This historical context in which the doctrine of State action evolved in the United States is irrelevant for our purpose especially since we have Article 15 (2) in our Constitution. But it is the principle behind the doctrine of State aid, control and regulation so impregnating a private activity as to give it the colour of State action that is of interest to us and that also to the limited extent to which it can be Indianized and harmoniously blended with our constitutional jurisprudence. That we in no way consider ourselves bound by American exposition of constitutional law is welJ demonstrated by the fact that in R.D. Shetty9 this Court preferred the minority opinion of Douglas, J. in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Company1D as against the majority opinion of Rehnquist. J . And again in Air India v. Nergesh Meerza 18 this Court whilst preferring the minority view in General Electric Company v. Martha V. Gilbert11 said that the pro- visions of the American Constitution cannot always be applied to Indian conditions or to the provisions of our Constitution and whilst some of the principles adumbrated by the American decisions may provide a useful guide, close adherence to those principles while applying them to the provisions of our Constitution is not to be favoured, because the -,ocial conditions in our country are different. 30. Before we part with this topic, we may point out that this Court has throughout the last few years expanded the horizon of Article 12 primarily to inject respect for human rights and social conscience in our corporate structure. The purpose of expansion has not been to destroy the raimn d'etre of creating corporations but to advance the human rights jurisprudence. Prima facie we are not inclined to accept the apprehensions of learned counsel for Shriram as well founded when he says that our including within the ambit of Article 12 and thus subjecting to the discipline of Artic1e 21, those private corporations who,;e activities have the potential of affecting the life and health of the people. wouJd deal a death blow to the policy of encouraging and permittin!! private entrepreneurial activity. When- ever a new advance is made in the field of human rights, apprehension is always expressed by the status quoists that it will create enormous difficulties in the way of smooth functioning of the system and affect its stability. Similar apprehension was voiced when this Court in R.D. Shetn• rase8 brought public sector corporations within the scope 1 S. 42 L Ed (2d) 477 16.

UN[ON OF INDIA (Bhagwati, C.J.) 419 and ambit of Article 12 and subjected them to the discipline of fundamental rights. · Such apprehension expressed by those who may be affected by any new and innovative expansion of human rights need not deter the court from widening the scope of human rights and expanding their reach and ambit, if otherwise it is possible to do so without doing violence to the language of the constitutional provision. It is through creative interpretation and bold innovation that the human rights jurisprudence has been developed in our country to a remarkable extent and this forward march of the human rights movement cannot be allowed to be halted by unfounded apprehensions expressed by status quoists. But we do not propose to decide finally at the present stage whether a private corporation like Shriram would fall within the scope and ambit of Article 12, because we have not had sufficient time to consider and reflect on this question in depth. The hearing of this case before us concluded only on December 15, 1986 and we are called upon to deliver our judgment within a period of four days, on December 19, 1986. We are therefore, of the view that this is not a question on which we must make any definite pro- nouncement at this stage. But we would leave it for a proper and detai1ed consideration at a later stage if it becomes necessary to do so. 3.1. We must also deal with one other question which was seriously debated before us and that question is as to what is the measure of liability of an enterprise which is engaged in an hazardous or inherently dangerous industry, if by reason of an accident. occurring in such industry, persons die or are injured. Does the rule in: Rylands v. Fletcher18 apply or is there any other principle on which the liability can be determined. The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher18 was evolved in the year 1866 and it provides that a person who for his own purposes brings on to his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes must keep it at his peril and, if he fails to do so, is prima facie liable for the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. The liability under this rule is strict and it is no defence that the thing escaped without that person's wilful act, default or neglect or even that he had no knowledge of its existence. This rule laid down a principle of liability that if a person who brings on to his ]and and collects and keeps there anything likely to do harm and such thing escapes and does damage to another, he is liable to compensate for the damage caused. Of course, this rule applies only to non-natural user of the land and it does not apply to things naturally on the land or where the escape is due to an act of God and an act of a stranger or the default of the person injured or where the thing which escapes is present by the consent of the person injured or in certain cases where there is statutory authority. 18.

Considerable case law has developed in England as to what is natural and what is non-natural use of land and what are precisely the circumstances in which this rule may be displaced. But it is not necessary for us to consider these decisions laying down the parameters of this rule because in a modern industrial society with highly developed scientific knowledge anrl technology where hazardous or inherently dangerous industries are necessary to carry as part of the developmental pro- gramme, this rule evolved in the 19th century at a time when all these developments of science and technology had not taken place cannot afford any guidance in evolving any standard of liability consistent with the constitutional norms and the needs of the present day economy and social o;tructure. ,v e need not feel inhibited by this rule which was evolved in the context of a totally different kind of economy. Law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs of the fast changing society and keep abreast with the economic developments taking place in the country. As new situations arise the law has to be evolved in order to meet the challenge of such new situations. Law cannot afford to remain static. We have to evolve new principles and lay down new norms which would adequately deal with the new problems which arise in a hi!!hly induo;trfa.lised economy. We: cannot allow our judicial thinking to be constricted by reference to the law as it prevails in England or for the matter of that in any other foreign country. We no longer need the crutches of a foreign legal order. We are certainly prepared to receive light from whatever source it comes but we ha ve' to build our own i,1rispruden ce and we cannot countenance an argument that merely became the law in England does not recognise the rule of strict and 8.hsolute liability in cases of hazardous or inherently dangerous <1ctivities or the rule lairl down in Rylands v. Fletcher18 as developed in England recogni<;e<; certain limitations and exceptions, we in India must hold back our hands and not venture to evolve a new principle of liability since English courts have not done so. We have to develop our own law and if we find that it is necessary to construct a new principle of liability to deal with an unusual situation which has arisen and which is likely to arise in future on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous industries which are concommitant to an industrial economy, there is no reason why we should hesitate to evolve such principle of liability merely because it has not been so done in England. We are of the view that an enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry which poses a potential threat to the health and safety of the persons working in the factory and residing in the surrounding areas owes an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to anyone on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the activity which it has undertaken.

UNION OF INDIA (Bhagwati, C.J.) 421 be held to be under an obligation to provide that the haza1dous or inherently dangerous activity in which it is engaged must be conducted with the highest standards of safety and if any harm results on account of such activity, the enterprise must be absolutely liable to compensate for such harm and it should be no answer to the enterprise to say that it had taken all reasonable care and that the harm occurred without any negligence on its part. Since the persons harmed on account of the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity carried on by the enterprise would not be in a position to isolate the process of opera- tion from the hazardous preparation of substance or any other related element that caused the harm the enterprise must be held strictly liable for causing such harm as a part of the social cost of carrying on the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity. If the enterprise is per- mitted to carry on an hazardous or inherently dangerous activity for its profit, the law must presume that such permission is conditional on the enterprise absorbing the cost of any accident arising on account of such hazardous or inherently dangerous activity as an appropriate item of its overheads. Such hazardous or inherently dangerous activity for private profit can be tolerated only on condition that the enterprise engaged in such hazardous or inherently dangerous activity indemnifies all those who suffer on account of the carrying on of such hazardous or inherently dangerous activity regardless of whether it is carried on carefully or not. This principle is also sustainable on the ground that the enterprise alone has the resource to discover and guard against hazards or dangers and to provide warning against potential hazards. We would therefore hold that where '.in enterprise is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous activity and harm results to anyone on account of an accident in the operation of such hazardous or inherently dangerous activity resulting, for example, in escape of toxic gas the enterprise is strictly and absolutely liable to compensate all those who are affected by the accident and such liability is not subject to any of the exceptions which operate vis-a-vis the tortious principle of strict liability under the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher1 8 • 32. We would also like to point out that the measure of com- pensation in the kind of cases ref erred to in the preceding paragraph must be corelated to the magnitude and capacity of the enterprise because such compensation must have a deterrent effect. The larger and more prosperous the enterprise, the greater must be the amount of compensation payable by it for the harm caused on account of an accident in the carrying on of the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity by the enterprise. 33.
