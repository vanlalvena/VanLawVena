Merchant Shipping - Insurance - P&I Club - Necessity of P&I insurance cover is in commercial expediency The appellant (Club) herein is an association incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom. It is a mutual association of shipowners. It offers insurance cover in respect of the vessels entered with it for diverse third-party risks associated with the operation and trading of vessels. According to the appellant, e no vessel operates without a protection and indemnity (P&I) cover and the same has been made compulsory to allow a ship to enter major ports in India. Sea Ranger and Sea Glory are the sister vessels of the 1st respondent vessel and they f are allegedly owned by the 2nd respondent. The first two vessels entered into a contract with the appellant's Association for the years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 but they had not paid the unpaid insurance premium due and payable by the 2nd respondent for various P&I risks for which they had been insured. These unpaid insurance calls were claimed to be \"necessaries\" and as such enforceable within the \"admiralty jurisdiction\" of the Bombay High Court. The Club filed a suit for g arrest of the first respondent vessel which came to Mumbai Port within the territorial waters of India praying for a decree against the respondents for a certain sum with interest thereon being the unpaid insurance premium due to the Club and payable by the second respondent and for arrest of the first respondent vessel to secure the claim.

SEA SUCCESS I 513 rejection of the plaint purported to be under Order 7 Rule l l(a) CPC inter alia on the ground that the averments contained therein do not disclose a cause of action as the claim of unpaid insurance premium was not a \"necessary\" within the meaning of Section 5 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861. A Single Judge of the High Court referred the said question to a Division Bench as it could not agree with a decision rendered by another Single Judge. However, on the other two grounds it discharged the notice of motion holding that the averments made in paras 1 and 14 of the plaint inter alia to the effect that all the three ships are beneficially owned by the 2nd respondent disclose a cause of action. An appeal thereagainst was preferred by the respondent. The Division Bench took up the appeal preferred by the respondent as also the reference made by the Single Judge and passed a common judgment. The questions which arose for consideration before the High Court were: (i) whether arrears of insurance premium due and payable to the appellant by the 2nd respondent would fall within the scope and ambit of Section 5 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861; (ii) whether refusing to reject the plaint under Order 7 Rule ll(a) upon holding that the plaint discloses a cause of action is a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court and was, thus, appealable; and (iii) whether the averments made in paras 1 and 14 of the plaint disclose sufficient cause of action for maintaining a suit. The Division Bench while answering Question (i) in favour of the appellant, answered Questions (ii) and (iii) against it. Allowing the appeal filed by the Club, the Supreme Court Held: Having regard to the legislative and executive policy, England and Wales never considered the arrears of insurance premium as a \"necessary\". The courts of England further maintained a distinction between a maritime claim and maritime lien. The English courts proceeded on the premise that for the purpose of considering as to whether any necessary has been supplied to a ship or not must have a sufficient and direct connection with the operation of the ship. It held that unpaid insurance premium is not a maritime claim as it is not needed to keep it going. (Para 23) R. v.

A lot of amendments in the statutes as also a interpretive changes took place. The decisions rendered by different courts on marine insurance law even frequently apply to non-marine insurance. With the increase in marine traffic, the insurance law also developed and new varieties of insurance covers came into being. There has been a considerable expansion of the practice of insurance against various forms of legal liabilities which the assured may incur to the third parties. (Para 34) P&I mutual insurances cover the liabilities of assured shipowner incurred to b third parties. The necessity of a P&I cover is in commercial expediency. All P&I Clubs are non-profit-making companies. The owner upon entering the ship becomes the member of the P&I Club and he not only pays membership fee but undertakes to pay contribution towards the losses incurred by other members of the Club which are payable by the company. A new concept has come into being in terms whereof a reciprocal system has been evolved to the effect that each C member is cast under a duty to refund the damage suffered by any one of them and pay, on mutual basis, each other's claim. Thus, the members play a dual role of both beneficiary and benefactor. The Indian statutes operating in the field are pointer to the fact that such insurance has become more and more commercially expedient. No ship having regard to the ramifications in international law can sail without such insurance. Apart from the 1952 Brussels Arrest Convention, the Merchant Shipping (Oil) Pollution Act, 1961 makes insurance compulsory. P&I d insurance cover to call at major ports in India is now a statutory requirement. (Paras 35, 40 and 41) Mandaraka-Sheppard, Aleka: Modern Admiralty Law, p. 642; Baughen, Simon: Shipping Law, 2nd Edn., at pp. 16-17 and 183, relied on Interpretative changes, if any, must, thus be made having regard to the ever- changing global scenario. Legal history is a good guide for the purpose of appreciating the legal development across the world particularly in the field of e international law, maritime law being a part of it. While interpreting such a situation, one must take into consideration the flexibility in law. (Paras 56 and 55) M. V Al Quamar v. Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd., (2000) 8 SCC 278, referred to The advancement in law would be evident from the 1999 Arrest Convention whereby significant changes to the law relating to in rem claims and arrest have f been made. What was expressly excluded in the 1952 Arrest Convention has been included in the 1999 Convention. The restrictions imposed under the 1952 Convention as regard \"maritime claim\" to operation of ship and maintenance thereof have been removed. If the 1952 Arrest Convention had been applied, although India was not a signatory thereto, there is obviously no reason as to why the 1999 Arrest Convention should not be applied. M. V. Elisabeth defines the jurisdiction of the court but does not limit or restrict it. Application of the g 1999 Convention in the process of interpretive changes, however, would be subject to: (J) domestic law which may be enacted by Parliament; and (2) it should be applied only for enforcement of a contract involving public law character. It is not correct to contend that the Supreme Court, having regard to the decision in M. V. Elisabeth, must follow the law which is currently prevalent in UK and confine itself only to the 1952 Arrest Convention in Indian admiralty h jurisprudence.

Once the court opines that insurance is needed to keep the ship going - it has to be construed as \"necessaries\". The jurisdiction of the courts in India, in view of the decision in M. V.

It is true that the Supreme Court of India is not bound by the American decisions. The American decisions have merely a persuasive value but the Supreme Court would not hesitate in borrowing the principles if the same is in consonance with the scheme of Indian law keeping in view the changing global scenario. Global changes and outlook in trade and commerce could be a relevant factor. With the change of time, from narrow and pedantic approach, the court may resort to broad and liberal interpretation. What was not considered to be a necessity a century back, may be held to be so now. (Paras 63 and 65) National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nicolletta Rohtagi, (2002) 7 SCC 456 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 1788; Equilease Corpn. v. M. V Sampson, 793 F 2d 598 (US) (Com1 of Appeals) ; Trident Marine Managers Inc. v. Serial No. CEBRF 0661586, 1988 American Maritime Cases 763, referred to The major ports in India, namely, Mumbai and Kolkata had issued circulars from which it would appear that such insurance cover has been considered to be a service having regard to the cover extended to oil spill, damage to port, salvage operation etc. The circulars issued are pointers to the fact that development of law in other countries is being taken note of for the purpose of taking insurance cover in different fields as a compulsive measure. The circulars issued by the Port Trusts may not be determinative but the same would also be a relevant factor. The tenn \"necessaries\" had not been defined in the Act of 1861. It was given a meaning by judicial pronouncements. The term \"necessary\" is a term of art but the same cannot be used in a limited context of mandatory claims made for goods or services supplied to a particular ship for her physical necessity as opposed to commercial operation and maintenance. Physical necessity and practicality would be a relevant factor for detennination of the said question. Taking insurance cover would not only be commercial prudence but almost a must in the present-day context. The third-party insurance may not be compulsory in certain jurisdiction but having regard to the present-day scenario such an insurance cover must be held to be intrinsically connected with the operation of a ship. A compulsory insurance regime has come into being and keeping in view the changed situation the definition of the expression \"necessaries\" should also undergo a change.

Sampson, 793 F 2d 598 (US) (Court of Appeals), referred to One of the relevant factors for arriving at a conclusion as to whether anything would come within the expression \"necessary\" or not will inter alia c depend upon answer to the question as to whether a prudent owner would provide to enable a ship to perform well the functions for which she has been engaged. If getting the vehicle insured with P&I Club would be one of the things which would enable a prudent owner to sail his ship for the purposes for which she has been engaged, the same would come within the purview of the said term. The matter must be considered having regard to the changing scenario inasmuch as the field of insurance has undergone a sea change from merely hull and d machinery, the insurance companies cover various risks including oil spill damage to the port, damage to the cargo etc. In that sense the term must be construed in a broad and liberal manner. The changing requirement of a ship so as to enable it to trade in commerce must be kept in mind which would lead to the conclusion that P&I insurance cover would be necessary for operation of a ship. (Para 98) It may be true that there are a large number of insurance covers; from hull e and machinery insurance to protection and indemnity cover. But the question is not what insurance would be \"necessary\" and what would not be; as the issue has to be considered not only on a mere hypothesis but having regard to the statutes framed by other countries as also the 1999 Arrest Convention. (Para 99) For defending the limits of the jurisdiction of the case of a particular company the same must, therefore, be governed by the law prevailing therein. t The claim may be a maritime claim in a non-contracting country but not in others. The Club in law, therefore, would be entitled to enforce its claims against the \"Vessel\" keeping in view the law prevailing in India within whose territorial jurisdiction the ship is found. Only because the claim can be enforced in our country and not in some other countries, by itself would not lead to the conclusion that it cannot be enforced at all irrespective of the domestic law. The domestic legislation indisputably will prevail over any international convention g irrespective of the fact as to whether the country concerned is a party thereto or not. Where, how and when can a maritime claimant most advisedly arrest a ship in pursuit of its claim either in rem or in personam had all along been a complicated question keeping in view the principles of \"lex fori\". As a matter of policy legislation or otherwise England did not want that arrears of insurance premium should be included as a maritime claim, but the same would not imply that in other countries despite the unpaid insurance premium being maritime h claim, the same would not be enforceable.

Other types of insurance, keeping in view the existing statutes may not amount to a \"necessary\". In any event, such a question is not required to be answered at present. Therefore, unpaid insurance premium being a maritime claim would be enforceable in India. (Para 107) F.

Civil Procedure Code, 1908 - Or. 7 R. ll(a) - \"Cause of action\" - Meaning - Words and phrases - \"Cause of action\" It was submitted that by refusing to exercise discretion to reject a plaint, no right or liability of the party is decided and by reason thereof the procedure for determining the rights and obligations of the parties is only set in motion. Such an order would be akin to an order admitting the plaint. It was urged that by not rejecting the plaint the defences set out by the defendant are not obliterated as they will be entitled to raise all such contentions at the trial. By way of an analogy, it was argued that leave to defend a suit granted in favour of the defendant under Order 37 CPC would not be a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent being an interlocutory order as damage or prejudice in such a matter to the defendant must be a direct and immediate one. Held: The right of appeal which is provided under clause 15 of the Letters Patent cannot be said to be restricted. Clause 15 of the Letters Patent is not a special statute. Only in a case where there exists an express prohibition in the matter of maintainability of an intra-court appeal, the same may not be held to be maintainable. But in the event there does not exist any such prohibition and if the order will otherwise be a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent, an appeal shall be maintainable. (Paras 114 and 124) As by reason of an order passed under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, the rights conferred upon the parties are determined one way or the other, stricto sensu it would not be an interlocutory order but having regard to its traits and trappings would be a preliminary judgment.

An order refusing to reject a plaint will finally determine his right in terms of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. The idea underlying Order 7 Rule l l(a) is that when no cause of action is disclosed, the courts will not unnecessarily protract the hearing of a suit. d Having regard to the changes in the legislative policy as adumbrated by the amendments carried out in the Code of Civil Procedure, the courts would interpret the provisions in such a manner so as to save expenses, achieve expedition and avoid the court's resources being used up on cases which will serve no useful purpose.

Reliance upon a decision of the Calcutta High Court in Prahladrai Agarwalla v. Renuka Pal, AIR 1982 Cal 259 wherein it has been held that an order under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC refusing to reject a plaint is not a 9 judgment, is not apposite. In the said judgment, the judgment of the Supreme Court in Shah Babula/ Khimji, (1981) 4 SCC 8 was not taken into consideration. The ratio of the decision of the Supreme Court in Shah Babula/ Khimji as regard scope and ambit of the word \"judgment\" had not been noticed by the Calcutta High Court. The submission, however, to the effect that in the suit all defences would be open to the defendant, is misconceived inasmuch as, no evidence can h be adduced in absence of any pleading. There may not, furthermore be any requirement to go into the trial if the plaint does not disclose a cause of action. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h LIVERPOOL & LONDON S.P. & I. ASSN. LTD. v. M.V. SEA SUCCESS I 519 The contention that an order refusing to reject a plaint is one akin to an order amending the plaint would not be a correct proposition of law. The question as to whether the defendant despite such an order refusing to reject a plaint will have a right to show that the case is false would again be of no consequence. The said submission is based on a wrong premise. (Paras 116, 118 to 123) Tanusree Art Printers v. Rabindra Nath Pal, (2000) 2 CHN 213 and (2000) 2 CHN 843 (SB), referred to Justices of the Peace for Calcutta v. Oriental Gas Co. , (1872) 8 Beng LR 433: 17 Suth WR 364; Prahladrai Aganvalla v. Renuka Pal, AIR 1982 Cal 259, distinguished A cause of action is a bundle of facts which are required to be pleaded and proved for the purpose of obtaining relief claimed in the suit. For the aforementioned purpose, the material facts are required to be stated but not the evidence except in certain cases where the pleading relies on any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, wilful default or undue influence. (Para 140) Whether a plaint discloses a cause of action or not is essentially a question of fact. But whether it does or does not must be found out from reading the plaint itself. For the said purpose the averments made in the plaint in their entirety must be held to be correct. The test is as to whether if the averments made in the plaint are taken to be correct in their entirety, a decree would be passed. In ascertaining whether the plaint shows a cause of action, the court is not required to make an elaborate enquiry into doubtful or complicated questions of law or fact. By the statute the jurisdiction of the court is restricted to ascertaining whether on the allegations a cause of action is shown. So long as the claim discloses some cause of action or raises some questions fit to be decided by a judge, the mere fact that the case is weak and not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out. The purported failure of the pleadings to disclose a cause of action is distinct from the absence of full particulars. (Paras 139, 151 and 152) Mohan Rawale v. Damodar Tatyaba, (1994) 2 SCC 392; D. Ramachandran v. R. V Janakiraman, (1999) 3 SCC 267; Vijai Pratap Singh v. Dukh Haran Nath Singh, AIR 1962 SC 941 : 1962 All LJ 634, relied on It may be true that Order 7 Rule ll(a) although authorises the court to reject a plaint on failure on the part of the plaintiff to disclose a cause of action but the same would not mean that the avennents made therein or a document upon which reliance has been placed although discloses a cause of action, the plaint would be rejected on the ground that such averments are not sufficient to prove the facts stated therein for the purpose of obtaining reliefs claimed in the suit. Furthermore a fact which is within the special knowledge of the defendant need not be pleaded in the plaint. (Paras 146 and 148) Punit Rai v. Dinesh Chaudhary, (2003) 8 SCC 204, relied on Balwan Singh v. Lakshmi Narain, AIR 1960 SC 770, cited In the instant case the Club not only annexed certain documents with the plaint but also filed a large number of documents therewith. Those documents having regard to Order 7 Rule 14 CPC are required to be taken into consideration for the purpose of disposal of application under Order 7 Rule 1 l(a) CPC. (Para 142) The Club has pleaded that the Vessel is a sister ship of Sea Ranger and Sea Glory owned and possessed by the second defendant. The Club has also pleaded that Defendant 2 is beneficial owner of the first defendant ship. Determination on such assertions would amount to determination of question of fact.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 520 SUPREME COURT CASES (2004) 9 sec \"Vessel\" denies or disputes the same, an issue in that behalf will have to be framed and decided. Beneficial ownership of a ship is not a question of fact alone. It is a mixed question of fact and law. In that view of the matter it was not a necessary for the Club to set out the subordinate facts which are means of proving it or the evidence sustaining the allegations. In the aforementioned backdrop, the question as to whether the Club had been able to show that Respondent 1 is a sister ship of Sea Glory and Sea Ranger admittedly belonging to the first respondent is a matter which is required to be gone into in the suit. For the purpose of rejecting a plaint it is not necessary to consider whether the averments made in the plaint prove the factum that Defendant 1 Sea Success I is b a sister ship of Sea Glory and Sea Ranger or the said two ships are beneficially owned by Defendant 2. That the ship is a valuable commercial chattel and her arrest undeservingly prejudices third parties as well as affects the interest of the owner and others is a question which must be gone into when passing a final order as regard interim arrest of the ship or otherwise. For the aforementioned purpose the \"Vessel\" could file an application for vacation of stay. While c considering such an application, the court was entitled to consider not only a prima facie case but also the elements of balance of convenience and irreparable injury involved in the matter. In such a situation and particularly when both the parties disclose their documents which are in their possession, the court would be in a position to ascertain even prima facie as to whether the Club has been able to make out that Sea Glory and Sea Ranger are sister vessels of the \"Vessel\". (Paras 143, 144, 153, 150 and 154) d Williams v. Wilcox, (1838) 8 Ad & E 314 : 112 ER 857; Mohan Rawale v. Damodar Tatyaba, (1994) 2 SCC 392, relied on If a legal question is raised by the defendant in the written statement, it does not mean that the same has to be decided only by way of an application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, which may amount to prejudging the matter. (Para 155) Furthermore, the question as to whether the asset of a 100% subsidy can be e treated as an asset of the parent company would again depend upon the fact situation of each case. Furthermore, the question as to whether the concept of ownership of a ship which has been introduced in the 18th century when there had been no joint stock companies and the concept of shares in a ship so as to encourage individuals to pool their resources by a sister ship so that they may become co-owners is a matter which is required to be considered at an appropriate stage. It is not necessary to delve deep into the questions as to f whether the two ships named hereinabove are the sister ships of Respondent 1 vessel or whether the requirement of law as regard ownership of a ship in Respondent 1 as beneficial owner has been fulfilled or not. Such issues must be considered at an appropriate stage. It is, therefore, directed that in the event a proper application is filed either for dissolution of the interim order of injunction passed by the Single Judge or if the High Court in its wisdom thinks fit to decide g any issue as a preliminary issue such questions may be gone into in greater detail. Any observations made here must be considered to have been made only for the purpose of disposal of these appeals and not for the purpose of determining the merits of the matter. However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, the High Court is requested to consider the desirability of disposing of the matter as expeditiously as possible and preferably within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. h (Paras 156, 159 to 161) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

SINHA, J.- The background facts 1. The appellant (Club) herein is an association incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom. It is a mutual association of shipowners. It offers insurance cover in respect of the vessels entered with it for diverse third-party risks associated with the operation and trading of vessels. According to the appellant, no vessel operates without a protection and indemnity (P&I) cover and the same has been made compulsory to allow a ship to enter major ports in India. 2. Sea Ranger and Sea Glory are the sister vessels of the 1 st respondent vessel and they are allegedly owned by the 2nd respondent. The first two vessels entered into a contract with the appellant's Association for the years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 but they have not paid the unpaid insurance premium due and payable by the 2nd respondent for various P&I risks for which they had been insured. These unpaid insurance calls being \"necessaries\" were enforceable within the \"admiralty jurisdiction\" of the Bombay High Court. 3. For the arrest of the 1 st respondent vessel which came to Mumbai Port within the territorial waters of India, a suit was filed by the Club inter alia for the prayers: \"(a) for a decree against the respondents in the sum of US $ 1, 18,194.89 together with interest at the rate of 12 % per annum, which was the unpaid insurance premium amount due to the Club and payable by the 2nd respondent; and (b) for arrest of the 1st respondent vessel to secure the claim.\" 4. On an application for arrest of the 1 st respondent vessel having been made, the 2nd respondent appeared and undertook to furnish security in respect of the appellant's claim and further gave an undertaking that until the security is furnished the said vessel will not leave the port of Mumbai. However, thereafter S.S. Shipping Corporation Inc., Liberia claiming to be the registered owner of the 1 st respondent furnished a bank guarantee in relation to the appellant's claim in discharge of the undertaking of security given by the second respondent. The 1 st respondent thereafter took out a notice of motion for rejection of the plaint purported to be under Order 7 Rule 1 l(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure inter alia on the ground that the averments contained therein do not disclose a cause of action as the claim of unpaid insurance premium was not a \"necessary\" within the meaning of Section 5 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861. A learned Single Judge of the High Court after hearing the notice of motion by an order dated l-2- 2001/2-2-2001 referred the said question to a Division Bench as it could not agree with a decision rendered by another learned Single Judge. However, on the other two grounds it discharged the notice of motion holding that the averments made in paras 1 and 14 of the plaint inter alia to the effect that all the three ships are beneficially owned by the 2nd respondent disclose a cause of action. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The Division Bench took up the appeal preferred by the respondent herein as also the reference made by the learned Single Judge and passed a common a judgment. Issues 6. The questions which arose for consideration before the High Court were: (i) whether arrears of insurance premium due and payable to the appellant by the 2nd respondent would fall within the scope and ambit of b Section 5 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861; (ii) whether refusing to reject the plaint under Order 7 Rule 1 l(a) upon holding that the plaint discloses a cause of action is a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court and was, thus, appealable; and (iii) whether the averments made in paras 1 and 14 of the plaint disclose sufficient cause of action for maintaining a suit. 7. The Division Bench while answering Question (i) in favour of the appellant, answered Questions (ii) and (iii) against it. Appeal No. 226 of 2001 has been filed by the Club whereas Civil Appeal No. 5666 of 2002 has C been filed by the \"Vessel\". d Submissions 8. Mr Bharucha, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the \"Vessel\" would inter alia submit: (i) The amount of arrears of insurance premium alleged to be due to the 1 st respondent towards release calls is not a maritime claim entitling the Club to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court as such e unpaid insurance money does not constitute \"necessaries\" within the meaning of Section 5 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861. (ii) Sufficiently direct and proximate connection between insurance and the vessel is a prerequisite for bringing an action in rem. Insurance is meant primarily as a means of indemnifying and protecting the vessel-owner against the loss of his vessel and/or claims that may arise as f a result of damage or loss caused by the vessel. Although it may be a commercial necessity but the same would not come within the purview of the term \"necessaries\" within the meaning of the provisions of the said Act. The provisions contained in the Admiralty Court Acts of 1840 and 1861, Section 22 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1925, the 1952 Brussels Arrest Convention as also the Administration of Justice Act, g 1956 disclose one uniform feature that in order that a monetary claim qualifies for and is recognized as a maritime claim the same must be necessary for operation of the ship. (iii) In the United Kingdom, it has consistently been held for more than a century that unpaid insurance premium is not a \"necessary\" within the conventional meaning of the said term as understood in maritime law. h The said view has been reiterated by the courts of Australia, South Africa ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The matter has furthermore to be looked at from the point of view of physical necessity and practicality and not from the viewpoint of prudence or sound economics. (v) There are a large number of categories of insurance from hull and machinery insurance, to protection and indemnity (P&I) cover, through war risks, to freight demurrage and defence cover (FD&D), oil spill cover (TOVALOP), and strike cover etc. and in that view of the matter if P&I should be held to be a necessary and others are not, the same would lead to an incongruous situation.

Mr Prashant S. Pratap, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Club, on the other hand, would submit that: (i) \"Necessaries\" are the things which a prudent owner would b provide to enable a ship to perform the functions wherefor she has been engaged and, thus, the provision of services would come within the definition of necessaries. (ii) The term \"necessaries\" must be construed in a broad and liberal manner keeping in mind the ever-changing requirements of a ship to be able to trade in commerce. c (iii) Contemporary maritime statutes in England do not use the term \"necessaries\" but the American Federal Maritime Liens Act does and, thus, decision rendered by the American courts that insurance is a \"necessary\" should be held to be correct (Equilease Corpn. v. M. V. Sampson 13 ). (iv) A valid P&I insurance cover is necessary for a ship to call at major ports in India and consequently so far as India is concerned, it is a necessity having regard to the fact that Mumbai Port, JNPT and Kolkata Port have issued a statutory direction in this behalf. d (v) The domestic legislation in India also provides for a compulsory insurance. Reference in this connection has been placed on the Inland e Vessel Act, 1917 ( as amended in the year 1977), the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (as amended in 1983) and the Multimodal Transportation of Goods Act, 1993 (as amended in 2000) and in that view of the matter the pedantic and regressive view should be discouraged especially in the light of the judgment of this Court in M. V. Elisabeth 12. ( vi) By reason of the 1999 Arrest Convention inter alia unpaid f insurance calls had been added and in absence of any codification and maritime claim by a statute in India the same should be taken into consideration for determination of the jurisdiction of the High Court. Several countries such as Canada, South Africa, Australia, China and Korea have given the claim for unpaid insurance premium in respect of a ship, the status of a maritime claim. g (vii) Flexibilities being the virtue of law court, the High Court has rightly held that the marine premium would come within the purview of the tenn \"necessaries\" having regard to the global change and outlook in trade and commerce. Reliance in this connection has been placed on M. V. Al Quamar v.

The jurisdiction of the High Court of Admiralty in England used to be exercised in rem in such matters as from their very nature would give rise to a maritime lien - e.g. collision, salvage, bottomry. The jurisdiction of the High Court of Admiralty in England was, however, extended to cover matters in respect of which there was no maritime lien i.e. necessaries supplied to a foreign ship. In terms of Section 6 of the Admiralty Act, 1861, the High Court of Admiralty was empowered to assume jurisdiction over foreign ships in respect of claims to cargo carried into any port in England or Wales. By reason of the Judicature Act of 1873, the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice resulted in a fusion: of admiralty law, common law and equity. The limit of the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court in terms of Section 6 of the 1861 Act was discarded by the Administration of Justice Act, 1920 and the jurisdiction of the High Court thereby was extended to (a) any claim arising out of an agreement relating to the use or hire of a ship; (b) any claim relating to the carriage of goods in any ship; and (c) any claim in tort in respect of goods carried in any ship. 17.

The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court was further widened by the Administration of Justice Act, 1956 so as to include not only the claims specified under Section 1 (i) of Part I but also any other jurisdiction which either was vested in the High Court of Admiralty immediately before the date of commencement of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1873 (i.e. b 1-11-1875) or is conferred by or under an Act which came into operation on or after that date on the High Court as being a court with admiralty jurisdiction and any other jurisdiction connected with ships vested in the High Court apart from this section which is for the time being assigned by rules of court to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. 19. Sub-section ( 4) of Section 1 removed the restriction based on the c ownership of the ship. By reason of clauses (d), (g) and (h) of the said section the jurisdiction in regard to question or claims specified under Section 1 (i) included any claim for loss of or damage to goods carried in a ship, any claim arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or to the use or hire of a ship. 20. In the course of time the jurisdiction of the High Courts vested in all d the divisions alike. The Indian High Courts after independence exercise the same jurisdiction. Necessaries - as a maritime claim 21. The concept \"as to claims for necessaries\" is specified under Section 5 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, which provides for the jurisdiction of the e High Court as regard \"necessaries supplied to any ship elsewhere than in the port to which the ship belongs, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that at the time of the institution of the cause any owner or part-owner of the ship is domiciled in England or Wales\". 22. The term \"necessaries\" had not been defined in the Act of 1861. It f was given a meaning by judicial pronouncements. 23. It stands accepted that having regard to the legislative and executive policy, England and Wales never considered the arrears of insurance premium as a \"necessary\". The courts of England further maintained a distinction between a maritime claim and maritime lien. The decisions cited by Mr Bharucha go to show that the English courts proceeded on the premise that g for the purpose of considering as to whether any necessary has been supplied to a ship or not must have a sufficient and direct connection with the operation of the ship. It held that unpaid insurance premium is not a maritime claim as it is not needed to keep it going. (See R. v. Judge of the City of London Court1, Heinrich Bjorn 4, The Andre Theodore5 and The Aifanourios10 .)

Seekamp 3 adopted and applied in proceedings in admiralty. Semble, there is no distinction between necessaries for the ship and necessaries for the voyage.\" 26. In Edinburgh Castle, The 17 it has been held: \"To address these concerns, Mr Charkham helpfully invited my attention to a number of authorities and to such discussion as there is on Section 20(2)(m) and its predecessors. Taking the matter very shortly, for present purposes, the following propositions emerge: 1. The words 'in respect of' are wide words which should not be unduly restricted: Kommunar, The 18, Lloyd's Rep at p. 5. 2. Section 20(2)(m), which is derived from the equivalent provision in the Administration of Justice Act, 1956, contains a jurisdiction which is no narrower than the predecessor jurisdiction in respect of claims for 'necessaries': Fairport (No. 5), The 19 ; The Kommunar 18 • 3. No distinction is to be drawn: ... between necessaries for the ship and necessaries for the voyage, and all things reasonably requisite for the particular adventure on which the ship is bound are comprised in this category. (Roscoe: The Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice, 5th Edn., at p. 203: The Riga 16.) 4. The jurisdiction extends to the provision of services: Equator, The 20 ; The Fairport (No. 5) 19• In the light of these propositions, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs bring their claims within Section 20(2)(m). Provisions for the passengers were 'necessaries' for the particular adventure on which this passenger vessel was engaged. The provision of services is capable of coming within the sub-section and does so here, given the nature of the services provided.

Identical view has been taken by a court of Durban in M. V. Emerald Transporter22 with reference to the provisions contained in the Admiralty Jurisdiction Regulation Act 105 of 1983 wherein it was held that services which are insured solely to the benefit of the shipowner would not be classed as necessaries. The said decision was, however, rendered in the context of b ranking of claims against a fund comprising of sale proceeds of the vessel M. V. Emerald Transporter. 29. The House of Lords in The River Rima7 considered the provisions of Article 1 (1 )(k) of the 1952 Brussels Arrest Convention incorporating \"goods or materials wherever supplied to a ship for her operation or maintenance\" as a maritime claim. Having regard to the provisions contained in Section 6 of c the Admiralty Court Act, 1840 and Section 5 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861 it was held: (All ER p. 646d-e) \"In other words, what is now called a claim in respect of goods or materials supplied to a ship for her operation or maintenance is the equivalent of what used to be called a claim for necessaries, but without the restrictions which formerly applied to such a claim.\" d (emphasis supplied) 30. The Singapore High Court also in Golden Petroleum9 considered the expression \"goods supplied to a ship for her operation and maintenance\" in the following terms: \"In my opinion, bunker oil supplied to the ship for sale to other ships e could not be conceived as goods supplied for her operation. The phrase 'operation of the ship' should not be equated with the business activities of the shipowner and the section as enacted could not cover goods which are loaded on to two ships only to be unloaded or disposed of soon thereafter by sale.\" It appears that the matter is pending in appeal. f 31. Yet again in Gatoil International 11 it was held: (All ER p. 137d-e) \"An agreement for the cancellation of a contract for the carriage of goods in a ship or for the use or hire of a ship would, I think, show a sufficiently direct connection. It is unnecessary to speculate what other cases might be covered. Each case would require to be decided on its own facts. As regards the contract of insurance founded on in the instant g appeal, I am of opinion that it is not connected with the carriage of goods in a ship in a sufficiently direct sense to be capable of coming within para (e).\" 32.

With a view to answer the question it is necessary to consider as to whether a failure to insure the security is a matter which would have a bearing upon the security of the ship. 33.

The law of marine insurance rested almost entirely on common law. Only a few isolated points were dealt with by statute. Although, there may be a plethora of authority on some points, the decisions may be meagre on others. The interpretative changes made from time to time turned upon new commercial conditions, the old ones having become obsolete. Some countries enacted and codified marine laws while many did not. With the passage of time, the scope and ambit of the contracts of insurance increased not only having regard to the experience gathered by the contracting parties but also by the legislators and the court. A lot of amendments in the statutes as also interpretive changes took place. The decisions rendered by different courts on marine insurance law even frequently apply to non-marine insurance. With the increase in marine traffic, the insurance law also developed and new varieties of insurance covers came into being. There has been a considerable expansion of the practice of insurance against various forms of legal liabilities which the assured may incur to the third parties. 35. P&I mutual insurances cover the liabilities of assured shipowner incurred to third parties. In Mandaraka-Sheppard, Aleka: Modern Admiralty Law, at p. 642, it is stated: \"P&I mutual insurance (P&I associations) cover the liabilities of their assured shipowner incurred to third parties, which include cargo claims, pollution liabilities, damage to harbours, piers, etc. and personal injury or loss of life claims, which are all excluded from the RDC clause. In addition the P&I association insures the remaining one-fourth of the assured' s liability under the RDC clause. Legal costs in defending such claims are covered as well.\" 36. The title of a claimant to sue the defendant as regard cargo claim enquiry has been stated in Baughen, Simon: Shipping Law, 2nd Edn., at pp. 16-17 in the following terms: \"Does the claimant have title to sue the defendant? 'Title to sue' means the claimant's right to sue the defendant, be it in contract, tort or bailment, in respect of the transit losses it will have borne as a buyer taking delivery at the end of a chain of sale contracts. If the claimant has insured the goods and has been indemnified, then the action may be brought in its name by its insurers under the process of subrogation.

The Agreement began as an Agreement between the P&I Clubs as to how they would recommend settlement of cargo claims as between shipowners and charterers where the NYPE form time charter is used. It is now common for the Agreement to be specifically incorporated into the time charter. Indeed the NYPE, 1993 fonn contains a printed clause 27 to this effect.\" c 39. The Special Compensation P&I Club Clause (the SCOPIC clause) enumerated from Article 14 remuneration after the Nagasaki Spirit, in 1999 as a result of discontent by salvors. Although this provision affected only the salvor and the shipowner, the international groups of P&I Clubs have agreed a code of conduct giving their backing to the clause whenever a ship entered d with the International Group is salved by a member of the International Salve Union. The salient features of the claim which received clarificatory amendment in 2000 are as under: \"For the clause to operate it needs to be specifically incorporated into an LOF contract, of whatever form. LOF, 2000 contains a box to be ticked if the parties agree to the incorporation of the SCOPIC clause. If e the clause is incorporated it then needs to be invoked by salvor. This can be done even if there is no threat to the environment. Invoking the clause completely replaces the right of the salvor to claim under Article 14, even in respect of services performed before the invocation of the clause. The provisions of Articles 14(5) and (6), however, continue to remain effective. Within two days of the clause being invoked, clause 3 obliges f the shipowner to put up security for the salvor's claim under the clause in the amount of US $ 3,000,000. If the shipowner fails to do so, clause 4 entitles the salvor to withdraw from the SCOPIC clause, provided the security is still outstanding at the date of withdrawal. Clause 5 provides that SCOPIC remuneration is to be calculated by reference to an agreed tariff of rates that are profitable to salvors, g calculated by reference to the horsepower of the salvage tug/s employed. It also covers the salvor's out-of-pocket expenses. An uplift of 25% is applied to both these heads of claim. Clause 6 provides that SCOPIC remuneration is payable only in the event that it exceeds the amount of the award under Article 13. To deter salvors from invoking SCOPIC too readily, clause 7 provides that in the event of SCOPIC remuneration h falling below the amount of the Article 13 award, that award shall be ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Thus, where the Article 13 award is for $ 1,000,000 and the SCOPIC remuneration is only $ 600,000, the Article 13 award will be reduced by$ 100,000 being 25% of the difference between the two sums, giving the salvor a net award of$ 900,000. The SCOPIC clause also provides for the termination of both the SCOPIC provisions and the LOF in two situations. First, the salvor can terminate if the cost of its services less any SCOPIC remunerations exceeds the value of the salved property. Secondly, the shipowner can terminate by giving five days' notice. These termination provisions do not apply if the contractor is restrained from demobilizing its equipment by a public body with jurisdiction over the area where the services are being performed. Once the clause has been invoked, the shipowner is entitled to appoint a Special Casualty Representative (SCR) to monitor the salvage services. The SCR does not impinge on the authority of the salvage master but does have the right to be kept fully informed about the progress of the salvage operations. This provision improves the flow of information back to the P&I Club whose interests will ultimately be affected by the salvage services.\" (See Baughen, Simon: Shipping Law - p. 293) Necessity of insurance cover 40. The necessity of a P&I cover is in commercial expediency. All P&I Clubs are non-profit-making companies. The owner upon entering the ship becomes the member of the P&I Club and he not only pays membership fee but undertakes to pay contribution towards the losses incurred by other members of the Club which are payable by the company. A new concept has come into being in terms whereof a reciprocal system has been evolved to the effect that each member is cast under a duty to refund the damage suffered by any one of them and pay, on mutual basis, each other's claim. Thus, the members play a dual role of both beneficiary and benefactor. We have noticed the concept of such clubs. The Indian statutes operating in the field are pointer to the fact that such insurance has become more and more commercially expedient. No ship having regard to the ramifications in international law can sail without such insurance. Apart from the 1952 Brussels Arrest Convention, the Merchant Shipping (Oil) Pollution Act, 1961 makes insurance compulsory. 41. As would be noticed hereinafter, P&I insurance cover to call at major ports in India is now a statutory requirement. Changing scenario 42. The advancement in law would be evident from the 1999 Arrest Convention whereby significant changes to the law relating to in rem claims and arrest have been made. Pursuant to Article 14 of the 1999 Arrest Convention, such changes would come into force six months after ratification by the tenth State. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

SEA SUCCESS 1 (Sinha, J.) 537 (u) this extends the scope of claims in respect of mortgages by removing the reference to a registered or registrable mortgage, thereby encompassing unregistered mortgages .... 45. The purpose of the 1952 Convention was to restrict the possibilities of arrest with regard to seagoing vessels flying the flag of a contracting State. Such an arrest was allowed for maritime claims against the vessel or against the sister ship belonging to the same owners. What would be the maritime claim is specified in Article 1 of the Convention. Other claims can only be secured if the vessel's home port is situated in a non-contracting State. 46. Apart from those restrictions resulting from the Convention, all kinds of claims can be secured by an arrest and there is no need to prove a connection with the operation of the vessel. As for example, a guarantee given by the owners for a subsidiary company or other principal debtor is as suitable as a claim resulting from the purchase of the ship or any other goods by the owners. However, in terms of Article 1 (k) of the Convention claims for \"goods or materials\" supplied to a ship for her operation or maintenance are acknowledged as maritime claims. 47. What was expressly excluded in the 1952 Convention has been included in the 1999 Convention. The restrictions imposed under the 1952 Convention as regard \"maritime claim\" to operation of ship and maintenance thereof have been removed. 48. In Kapila Hingorani v. State of Bihar23 this Court observed: (SCC pp. 23-24 & 30, paras 44-46 & 60) \"44. Justice Holmes expressed the following view in Missouri v.

It was enough for them to realise or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much f sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience, and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago.' 45. Justice Frankfurter elucidated the interpretive role in Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes: 'There are varying shades of compulsion for judges behind g different words, differences that are due to the words themselves, their setting in a text, their setting in history. In short, judges are not unfettered glossators.

Union of India25 it is stated: 'Law, constitutional law, is not an omnipotent abstraction or distant idealization but a principled, yet pragmatic, value-laden and a result-oriented, set of propositions applicable to and conditioned by a concrete stage of social development of the nation and aspirational imperatives of the people. India Today - that is the inarticulate major premise of our constitutional law and life.' * * * 60. It is also well settled that interpretation of the Constitution of b India or statutes would change from time to time. Being a living organ, it is ongoing and with the passage of time, law must change. New rights may have to be found out within the constitutional scheme. Horizons of constitutional law are expanding.\" 49. In the aforementioned judgment, this Court referred to a large c number of decisions for the purpose of interpreting the constitutional provisions in the light of the international treaties and conventions. 50. Further more in John Vallamattom v. Union of India 26 while referring to an amendment made in UK in relation to a provision which was in pari materia with Section 118 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, this Court observed: (SCC p. 624, para 28) d \"The constitutionality of a provision, it is trite, will have to be judged keeping in view the interpretive changes of the statute effected by passage of time.\" 51. Ref erring to the changing scenario of the law having regard to the declaration on the right to development adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights and Article 18 of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and e Political Rights, 1966, it was held: (SCC p. 625, paras 33-36) \"33. It is trite that having regard to Article 13(1) of the Constitution, the constitutionality of the impugned legislation is required to be considered on the basis of laws existing on 26-11-1950, but while doing so the court is not precluded from taking into consideration the subsequent events which have taken place thereafter. It is further trite that f the law although may be constitutional when enacted but with passage of time the same may be held to be unconstitutional in view of the changing situation. 34. Justice Cardozo said: 'The law has its epochs of ebb and flow, the flood tides are on us. The old order may change yielding place to new; but the transition is 9 never an easy process.' 35.

In any view of the matter even if a provision was not unconstitutional on the day on which it was enacted or the Constitution came into force, by reason of facts emerging out thereafter, the same may be rendered unconstitutional.\" 52. Yet again in Indian Handicrafts Emporium v. Union of India27 this Court considered the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and applied the principles of purposive construction as also not only the directive principles as contained in Part IV of the Constitution but also fundamental duties as contained in Part IV-A thereof. 53. Referring to Motor General Traders v. State of A.P. 28 , Rattan Arya v. State of T.N. 29 and Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of U.P. 30 this Court held: (SCC p. 608, para 49) \"49. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that a law which was at one point of time constitutional may be rendered unconstitutional because of passage of time. We may note that apart from the decisions cited by Mr Sanghi, recently a similar view has been taken in Kapila Hingorani v. State of Bihar23 and John Vallamattom v. Union of India26.\" 54. It was, however, held that India being a sovereign country is not obligated to make law only in terms of CITES. It may impose stricter restrictions having regard to the local needs. 55. Legal history is a good guide for the purpose of appreciating the legal development across the world particularly in the field of international law, maritime law being a part of it. While interpreting such a situation, one must take into consideration the flexibility in law as has been highlighted by this Court in M. V. Al Quamar14 wherein it was opined: (SCC p. 308, para 43) \"43. The two decisions noted above in our view deal with the situation amply after having considered more or less the entire gamut of judicial precedents. Barker, J.'s judgment in the New Zealand case31 very lucidly sets out that the court has to approach the modem problem with some amount of flexibility as is now being faced in the modem business trend. Flexibility is the virtue of the law courts as Roscoe Pound puts it. The pedantic approach of the law courts are no longer existing by reason of the global change of outlook in trade and commerce.

No statutory law in India operates in the field. Interpretative changes, if any, must, thus be made having regard to the ever-changing global scenario. 57. This Court in M. V. Elisabeth 12 observed that Indian statutes lag b behind any development of international law and further it had not adopted the various conventions but opined that the provisions thereof having been made as a result of international unification and development of the maritime laws of the world should be regarded as the international common law or transnational law rooted in and evolved out of the general principles of national laws, which, in the absence of any specific statutory provisions can c be adopted and adapted by courts to supplement and complement national statutes on this subject. 58. This Court in M. V. Elisabeth 12 observed: (SCC p. 453, para 30) \"30. The Exchequer Court of Canada was established by the Admiralty Act R.S. Canada, 1906, c. 141, as a Colonial Court of d Admiralty. It is not clear whether that Court was in its jurisdiction comparable to the Indian High Courts. Assuming that it was comparable at the relevant time, and whatever be the relevance of Yuri Maru 32 to courts like the Exchequer Court of Canada, we see no reason why the jurisdiction of Indian High Courts, governed as they now are by the Constitution of India, should in any way be subjected to the jurisdictional e fetters imposed by the Privy Council in that decision. Legal history is good guidance for the future, but to surrender to the former is to lose the latter.\" (emphasis supplied) (See paras 78 and 99 also.) It was further observed: (SCC pp. 476-77, para 89) \"89. All persons and things within the waters of a State fall within its f jurisdiction unless specifically curtailed or regulated by rules of international law. The power to arrest a foreign vessel, while in the waters of a coastal State, in respect of a maritime claim, wherever arising, is a demonstrable manifestation and an essential attribute of territorial sovereignty. This power is recognised by several international conventions. (See the conventions referred to above. See also Nagendra g Singh, International Maritime Conventions, British Shipping Laws, Vol. 4.) These conventions contain the unified rules of law drawn from different legal systems.

The want of ratification of these conventions is apparently not because of any policy disagreement, as is clear from active and fruitful Indian participation in the formulation of rules adopted by the conventions, but perhaps because of other circumstances, such as lack of an adequate and specialised machinery for implementation of the various international conventions by coordinating for the purpose the departments concerned of the Government. Such a specialised body of legal and technical experts can facilitate adoption of internationally unified rules by national legislation. It is appropriate that sufficient attention is paid to this aspect of the matter by the authorities concerned. Perhaps the Law Commission of India, endowed as it ought to be with sufficient authority, status and independence, as is the position in England, can render valuable help in this regard. Delay in the adoption of international conventions which are intended to facilitate trade hinders the economic growth of the nation.\" ( emphasis supplied) 59. M. V. Elisabeth 12 is an authority for the proposition that the changing global scenario should be kept in mind having regard to the fact that there does not exist any primary act touching the subject and in absence of any domestic legislation to the contrary; if the 1952 Arrest Convention had been applied, although India was not a signatory thereto, there is obviously no reason as to why the 1999 Arrest Convention should not be applied. 60. Application of the 1999 Convention in the process of interpretive changes, however, would be subject to: (1) domestic law which may be enacted by Parliament; and (2) it should be applied only for enforcement of a contract involving public law character. 61. It is not correct to contend as has been submitted by Mr Bharucha that this Court, having regard to the decision in M. V. Elisabeth 12, must follow the law which is currently prevalent in UK and confine itself only to the 1952 Arrest Convention in Indian admiralty jurisprudence. The question is as to if the 1952 Arrest Convention had been applied keeping in view the changing scenario why not the 1999 Arrest Convention also? A distinction must be borne in mind between a jurisdiction exercised by the High Courts in India in tenns of the existing laws and the manner in which such jurisdiction can be exercised. Once the court opines that insurance is needed to keep the ship going - it has to be construed as \"necessaries\". The jurisdiction of the courts in India, in view of the decision of this Court in M. V. Elisabeth 12 is akin to the jurisdiction of the English courts but the same would not mean that the Indian High Courts are not free to take a different view from those of the English courts. As regard application of a statute law the Indian High Courts would follow the pre-independence statute but Indian courts need not follow the judge-made law. 62. M. V. Elisabeth 12 defines the jurisdiction of the court but does not limit or restrict it. 63. Supply of necessaries is a maritime lien in USA in terms of the relevant statute and has been classified in the category of subordinate to the preferred ship mortgage. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The maritime lien, whether created by actual hypothecation or by implication or operation of law, may be enforced in the admiralty.\" 65. It is true that this Court is not bound by the American decisions. The American decisions have merely a persuasive value but this Court would not hesitate in borrowing the principles if the same is in consonance with the b scheme of Indian law keeping in view the changing global scenario. Global changes and outlook in trade and commerce could be a relevant factor. With the change of time, from narrow and pedantic approach, the court may resort to broad and liberal interpretation. What was not considered to be a necessity a century back, may be held to be so now. Indian statutes operating in the field 66. Section 352-N of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 makes such an insurance compulsory which reads as under: C \"352-N.

A circular has also been issued by the Insurance Association on 26-7- 2000 regarding new legislation in USA (Alaska) which is to the following effect: a \"To ALL MEMBERS 26-7-2000 Dear Sirs, Oil pollution: United States new legislation in Alaska for non-tank vessels Financial responsibility requirements: Draft Regulations In May 2000 the State of Alaska followed the recent example of California in passing legislation requiring non-tank self-propelled vessels operating in Alaskan waters and exceeding 400 gt to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility for oil spills occurring in Alaskan waters. The effective date of the Financial Responsibility Act is 1-9-2000. Proof of financial responsibility must be established for non-tank vessels operating in Alaskan waters in the following amounts: b C (a) For vessels carrying predominately persistent product, $ 300 per incident for each barrel of oil storage capacity, or $ 5,000,000, whichever is greater. (b) For vessels carrying predominately non-persistent product, d $ 100 per incident for each barrel of oil storage capacity, or $ 1,000,000, whichever is greater. The Act applies to non-tank vessels over 400 gt which by definition covers self-propelled vessels including commercial fishing vessels, passenger and cargo vessels. Barges are excluded, as are public vessels e unless 'engaged in commerce'. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) have proposed Draft Regulations to implement the financial responsibility requirements. ADEC predicts that their Regulations will not become final until September or early October 2000 but the effective date for the new law remains 1-9-2000. A summary of the Draft f Regulations is set out below: Interim applications and documentation for proof of financial responsibility An interim application procedure is set out in ADEC's letter of 17-7-2000, which is attached. Owners or operators of non-tank vessels covered by the new law must submit a completed application g and documentation of financial responsibility in the appropriate dollar amount not later than 31-8-2000.

Interim approval A completed application form and appropriate documentation evidencing proof of financial responsibility which is submitted by 31-8-2000 will be deemed approved by ADEC for purposes of meeting the 1-9-2000 deadline. Following adoption of final Regulations, ADEC will review each application to ensure that it meets the requirements of the statute and Regulations. A formal approval will be given to those vessels which qualify, and non-qualifying applicants will be given 30 days to submit additional information as requested by the Department. Application form A copy of ADEC's application form is attached. In Section (c), paragraph l(b), proof of financial responsibility by entry in a P&I Club must include a certificate of entry and must include 'all addenda pertaining to the amount and applicability of oil pollution cover and amount of deductibles'. Deductibles With respect of deductibles, paragraph l(c) of the application asks for proof of financial responsibility for any deductible, such as a certificate of deposit, or other 'financial information'. It thus appears that ADEC will require some evidence of financial responsibility for any deductible as is presently required by ADEC's Draft Regulations. ADEC is presently considering whether to allow an interim application which does not have separate proof of financial responsibility for a deductible. However, at this juncture owners and operators with insurance deductibles should probably plan to submit separate proof of financial responsibility for any deductible.

Whether arrears of insurance premium would come within the term \"necessaries\" is the core question involved in these appeals. The term has not a been statutorily defined. 79. The term \"necessaries\" as defined in Black's Law Dictionary reads as under: \"What constitutes 'necessaries' for which an admiralty lien will attach depends upon what is reasonably needed in the ship's business, b regard being had to the character of the voyage and the employment in which the vessel is being used.\" 80. In Bouvier's Law Dictionary, the tenn \"necessaries\" has inter alia been defined as follows: \"The term necessaries is not confined merely to what is requisite barely to support life, but includes many of the conveniences of refined c society. A racing bicycle was held a necessary for an apprentice earning 21 s a week and living with his parents: 78 LT 296.\" 81. In the Canadian Law Dictionary, the term \"necessaries\" has been defined as follows: \"In the case of ships, the term denotes whatever is fit and proper for d the service on which the ship is engaged, whatever the owner of that vessel, as a prudent man would have ordered if present at the time. ½ctoria Machinery Depot Co.

In Ballentine's Law Dictionary, the term \"necessaries\" has been defined as follows: e \"Under the maritime law pennitting the master of a ship to pledge the owner's credit for necessaries, the word does not import absolute necessity, but the circumstances must be such that a reasonable prudent owner, present, would have authorized the expenditures, and it is usually sufficient if they are reasonably fit and proper, having regard to the f exigencies and requirements of the ship, for the port where she is lying and the voyage on which she is bound. 48 Am Jlst Ship§ 133.\" 83. In 70 American Jurisprudence 2d, at p. 478, it is stated: \"The term 'necessary' in this connection does not mean indispensable to the safety of the vessel and crew; necessaries which will create a lien upon the ship are such as are reasonably fit and proper for g her under the circumstances, and not merely such as are absolutely indispensable for her safety or the accomplishment of the voyage.

We may further notice that in Mandaraka-Sheppard, Aleka: Modern Admiralty Law, at p. 52, it is stated: \"However, the decision of the Scottish Court of Session in The Aifanourios10, mentioned above, shattered the hopes of P&I Clubs. It took 19 years for the wheel to tum round and so to include such claims in the list of claims provided by the new Arrest Convention, 1999. The new Arrest Convention, 1999 has incorporated in the list of maritime claims for insurance premiums and brokerage, including claims by a P&I Club for unpaid calls. Such claims will qualify for an arrest of a ship to be made once the Convention comes into force, or is enacted by UK.\" 85. In Hodges, Susan and Hill, Christopher: Principles of Maritime Law, at p. 364, it is stated: \"Failure to insure the ship: The authorities of Laming v. Seater35 , Heather Bell, The 36 and Law Guarantee and Trust Society v. Russian Bank for Foreign Trade37 have all confirmed that a failure to insure the security is a matter which would have a bearing upon the security of the ship. In such an event, the mortgagee may enter into possession in order to make the ship available as security for the debt. It is to be noted that, in the last two cases, the court had also pointed out that a failure to insure the vessel (though it may constitute the basis of a right for the mortgagee to take possession) is not itself a legitimate ground for interfering with the performance of the charter party.\" 86. It is interesting to note that in Hazelwood, Steven J.: P&I Clubs - Law and Practice, it is stated: \"The defendant shipowners challenged the competence of the court to deal with the action as an action in rem. The catalogue of claims which entitle a claimant to proceed with an action in rem in the courts of Scotland are stated in Section 47(2) of the Administration of Justice Act, 1956 which provides, inter alia: 'This section applies to any claim arising out of one or more of the following, that is to say ... ( d) any agreement relating to the use or hire of any ship whether by charter or otherwise;'.\" 87. The learned author, however, noticed the shortcomings in the statutes operating in the United Kingdom and made a prophecy to the effect that contract of maritime insurance may be included in the list of claims giving the right of arrest in the following terms: \"The current position is, therefore, that claims arising out of contracts of marine insurance are not claims which entitle a claimant to proceed by way of action in rem and claimants in respect of P&I Club membership are in no better position than those claiming in respect of traditional hull and cargo insurance.

Certain heads of P&I cover have ceased to be matters which are, as Sir James Hannen P. once described, merely prudence but have become compulsory by law. a Compulsory liability insurance was introduced in the area of oil pollution liability by the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution, 1969. Under the regime thereby introduced a shipowner is legally unable to trade or put to sea without having effected oil pollution indemnity insurance and having adequate liability insurance is as 'necessary' to a shipowner as having fuel, stores, navigational equipment b or other well-recognised 'necessaries'. It is also arguable that as oil cannot be lawfully transported without the carrier having the required insurance cover, a contract for the entry of the vessel in a P&I Club could fairly be regarded as an agreement closely 'relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or to the use of a ship'. It may be that in any future review of the 1952 Arrest Convention, c claims relating to contracts of marine insurance will be included in the list of claims giving the right of arrest and provided the wording is framed appropriately to include club entry it may be that members who do not pay calls may one day find their vessels liable to arrest in this country.\" 88. The said prophecy has come true. The learned author has also noted d the decision in Marazura Navegacion S.A. v. Oceanus Mutual Underwriting Assn. (Bermuda) Ltd. and John Laing (Management) Ltd. 38 wherein it has been noticed: \"Clubs can and do arrest vessels for non-payment of calls in jurisdictions which allow such actions; for example, the United States;\" 89. In an interesting article \"The International Convention on Arrest of e Ships, 1999\" by Richard Shaw, it was opined: \"The 1999 Arrest Convention has produced a set of principles which are generally regarded as reasonably balanced, between the interests of legitimate claimants and those of shipping organizations seeking to ensure freedom of world trade without undue interference. The 1952 Arrest Convention has achieved a widespread degree of acceptance, and f indeed there were those who argued that it was preferable to retain its well-tried principles rather than risk upsetting them while correcting its few deficiencies. The extension of the right of arrest to claims for environmental damage, wreck removal, insurance premiums, commissions, brokerage and agency fees, and ship sale contracts are all significant steps to correct g those recognized deficiencies, while still retaining the exhaustive list of maritime claims which is the heritage of the common law admiralty jurisdiction.

The active participation in the conference of delegations from China, Russia and USA leads one to hope that these major States may, despite their relatively low rate of ratification of other maritime conventions, find this one sufficiently non- controversial to commend it to their legislatures.\" The learned author further stated: \"The principles of international law relating to jurisdiction have evolved significantly since 1952, in Europe in particular under the European Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments, 1968, but also with the development in English law of the doctrine of forum non conveniens in cases such as the 'ABIDIN DAVER' 39 . The terms of Article 7 have therefore been drafted to reflect the modem law, while retaining the original principle in para 1 that, in the absence of another rule of the lex fori arresti, the courts of the State where the ship has been arrested shall have jurisdiction to decide the merits of the claim.\" 90. In Project Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (Op . Ind. Weeramantry) the International Court in its judgment dated 25-9-1997 at p. 114 albeit in a different context observed: \"As this Court observed in Namibia case, 'an international instrument has to be interpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation' [Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1971, p. 31, para 53], and these principles are 'not limited to the rules of international law applicable at the time the treaty was concluded'.\" 91. In Equilease Corpn. v. M. V. Sampson 13 the Court was considering interpretation of the Ship Mortgage Act, 1946 providing for right to a federal maritime lien to \"any person furnishing repairs, supplies, or other necessaries, to any vessel\". It was held: \"Equilease next argues that no maritime lien arises in favor of James because insurance is not a 'necessary' and therefore neither general admiralty law nor the Act provides a maritime lien for unpaid insurance premiums. Equilease relies on Learned and on Grow v. Steel Gas Screw Lorrains K40, for this proposition. The Grow court stated in one sentence without elaboration that there is no federal maritime lien for insurance premiums, 310 F 2d at 54940, and went on to grant the plaintiff insurance broker a lien under Michigan State law. Grow is thus not of much aid to us here. We focus instead on Learned. Equilease urges us to apply Learned and to find that marine insurance in 1986 insures solely to the benefit of a ship's owner, in no way aiding the ship, and therefore, that no federal lien can be had for unpaid insurance premiums.

Under this reasoning, no lien against the ship itself could possibly arise a as the result of an insurance policy; 'unless the ship is benefited the ship should not pay'. In Re Petition of Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania41 , aff'd sub nom Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania v. Proceeds of the Sale of the Barge Waubauschene42 • It is no longer appropriate, however, to view maritime insurance this way. Even a vessel that simply sits at a dock without making any attempt to ply the waters must today have hull b protection and indemnity insurance. As the District Court noted, insurance is something that every vessel today needs just to carry on its normal business.\" It was further held: \"We therefore hold that because insurance is essential to keep a vessel in commerce, insurance is a 'necessary' under 46 USC Sec. 971 c and unpaid insurance premiums to give rise to a maritime lien under the FMLA.\" 92. Equilease Corpn. 13 has a greater persuasive value having regard to the fact that contemporary maritime statutes in England and other countries do not use the term \"necessaries\" but the American Federal Maritime Liens Act does. d 93. The Indian courts need not follow the English judicial ideologies blindly. We must remind ourselves that in many fields, particularly, in the matter of preservation of \"human rights\" and \"ecology\", Indian courts have gone far ahead than their English counterparts. 94. The decisions of the English courts have been held to be a departure e by the American courts with regard to the jurisdiction of the admiralty but such departure is a well-known one. 95. Equilease Corpn. 13 has been noticed in Trident Marine Managers Inc. v. Serial No. CEBRF 066158643 . 96. The question, however, is whether a prudent shipowner would provide for an insurance. A compulsory insurance regime has come into f being and keeping in view the changed situation the definition of the expression \"necessaries\" should also undergo a change. 97. The tenn \"necessary\" is a tenn of art but the same cannot, in our opinion, be used in a limited context of mandatory claims made for goods or services supplied to a particular ship for her physical necessity as opposed to commercial operation and maintenance. Physical necessity and practicality g would be a relevant factor for determination of the said question.

SEA SUCCESS I (Sinha, J.) 553 insurance cover must be held to be intrinsically connected with the operation of a ship. 98. One of the relevant factors for arriving at a conclusion as to whether anything would come within the expression \"necessary\" or not will inter alia depend upon answer to the question as to whether a prudent owner would provide to enable a ship to perform well the functions for which she has been engaged. If getting the vehicle insured with P&I Club would be one of the things which would enable a prudent owner to sail his ship for the purposes for which she has been engaged, the same would come within the purview of the said term. The matter must be considered having regard to the changing scenario inasmuch as the field of insurance has undergone a sea change from merely hull and machinery, the insurance companies cover various risks including oil spill damage to the port, damage to the cargo etc. In that sense the term must be construed in a broad and liberal manner. The changing requirement of a ship so as to enable it to trade in commerce must be kept in mind which would lead to the conclusion that P&I insurance cover would be necessary for operation of a ship. 99. It may be true that there are a large number of insurance covers: from hull and machinery insurance to protection and indemnity cover. But the question is not what insurance would be \"necessary\" and what would not be; as the issue has to be considered not only on a mere hypothesis but having regard to the statutes framed by other countries as also the 1999 Arrest Convention. Lexfori 100. In Benedict on Admiralty, 6th Edn., Vol. 1, p. 19, it has been stated: \"A ship is, of necessity, a wanderer. She visits shores where her owners are not known or are inaccessible. The master is the fully authorized agent of the distant owners but is not usually of sufficient pecuniary ability to respond to unforeseen demands of the voyage. These and other kindred characteristics of maritime commerce underlie the practice of finding in the ship itself security, in many cases, for demands against the master or owners in their conduct of the ship as an instrumentality, whether commercial or not, or in their contracts made on account of the ship.\" 101. In British Shipping Laws, Vol. 14, while contrasting maritime liens and statutory rights of action it is stated: ''Although maritime liens and statutory rights of action in rem are similar in that they involve the admiralty process in rem, there nonetheless exist fundamental differences between the two categories. These differences may be categorised as follows: (1) Nature of the claim.-Although the point is not free of uncertainty it is probably the case that a maritime lien is a substantive right whereas a statutory right of action in rem is in essence a procedural remedy. The object behind the availability of a statutory right of action in rem is to enable a claimant to found a jurisdiction and to provide the res as security for the claim.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

A party to litigation in England b must take the law of procedure as he finds it. He cannot by virtue of some rule in his own country enjoy greater advantages than other parties here; neither must he be deprived of any advantages that English law may confer upon a litigant in the particular form of action. To take an old example, an English creditor who sued his debtor in Scotland could not insist on trial by jury, nor, in the converse case, could a Scottish creditor c suing in England refuse the intervention of a jury, on the ground that in Scotland, where the debt arose, the case would have been tried by a judge alone.\" 103. An insurance transaction more often than not has links with more than one country. In a given case for resolution of a complex question the principles of private international law or the conflict of laws may have to be d turned to but with a view to determine the same, disputes have to be resolved by reference to the system of law which governs the contract of insurance. The jurisdiction to deal with an action by or against insurers in England and EC member States except Denmark are now governed by EC Council Regulation 44 of 2001. In other countries, however, the law which is prevailing therein would govern the field. It may be true that some conventions like Brussels and Lugano are no longer relevant in most cases e involving EC member States but they form an important part of the background to the current jurisdictional regime. For defending the limits of the jurisdiction of the case of a particular company the same must, therefore, be governed by the law prevailing therein. The claim may be a maritime claim in a non-contracting country but not in others. The Club in law, therefore, would be entitled to enforce its claims against the \"Vessel\" keeping f in view the law prevailing in India within whose territorial jurisdiction the ship is found. Only because the claim can be enforced in our country and not in some other countries, by itself would not lead to the conclusion that it cannot be enforced at all irrespective of the domestic law. 104. Some countries like Canada, Australia and South Africa as well as communist regimes like China and Korea have made statutes as a result g whereof the maritime claims stand codified. The expression \"necessaries\" is not used in the said statutes except the statutes of the United States. The domestic legislation indisputably will prevail over any international convention irrespective of the fact as to whether the country concerned is a party thereto or not. 105.

SEA SUCCESS I (Sinha, J.) 555 as amended in the year 1999 either having been adopted by some countries or adopted by others, the law is enforced by the concerned countries having regard to their own domestic legal system. Where, how and when can a maritime claimant most advisedly arrest a ship in pursuit of its claim either in rem or in personam had all along been a complicated question keeping in view the principles of \"lex fori\". 106. As a matter of policy legislation or otherwise England did not want that arrears of insurance premium should be included as a maritime claim, but the same would not imply that in other countries despite the unpaid insurance premium being maritime claim, the same would not be enforced. Summary of the discussions 107. The discussions made hereinbefore lead to the conclusion that having regard to the changing scenario and keeping in tune with the changes in both domestic and international law as also the statutes adopted by several countries, a stand, however bold, may have to be taken that unpaid insurance premium of P&I Club would come within the purview of the expression \"necessaries supplied to any ship\". Other types of insurance, keeping in view the existing statutes may not amount to a \"necessary\". In any event, such a question, we are not called upon to answer at present. The discussions made hereinbefore under different subtitles of this judgment separately and distinctly may not lead us to the said conclusion but the cumulative effect of the findings thereunder makes the conclusion inevitable. The question has not only been considered from the angle of history of the judicial decisions rendered by different courts having great persuasive value but also from the angle that with the change in time interpretative changes are required to be made. We, therefore, in agreement with the judgment of the Bombay High Court, hold that unpaid insurance premium being a maritime claim would be enforceable in India. Maintainability of the letters patent appeal 108. Submission of Mr Pratap is that by refusing to exercise discretion to reject a plaint by account, no right or liability of the party is decided and by reason thereof the procedure for determining the rights and obligations of the parties is only set in motion. Such an order would be akin to an order admitting the plaint, Mr Pratap would submit. Reliance in this connection has been placed on Justices of the Peace for Calcutta v. Oriental Gas Co. 44 (Beng LR at p. 452). 109. It was urged that by not rejecting the plaint the defences set out by the defendant are not obliterated as they will be entitled to raise all such contentions at the trial. Reliance in this connection has been placed on Prahladrai Aga,walla v. Renuka Pal45 (AIR at p. 266). 110.

By way of an analogy, the learned counsel would argue that leave to defend a suit granted in favour of the defendant under Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure would not be a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause a 15 of the Letters Patent being an interlocutory order as damage or prejudice in such a matter to the defendant must be a direct and immediate one. 112. Clause 15 permits an appeal against the order passed by a Single Judge of the High Court in the second forum. 113. The relevant portion of clause 15 of the Letters Patent reads thus: \"And we do further ordain that an appeal shall lie to the said High Court b of Judicature at Madras, Bombay, Fort William in Bengal from the judgment ... of one Judge of the said High Court or one Judge of any Division Court, pursuant to Section 108 of the Government of India Act, and that notwithstanding anything hereinbefore provided, an appeal shall lie to the said High Court from a judgment of one Judge of the said High Court or one Judge of any Division Court, pursuant to Section 108 of the Government of c India Act, made (on or after the first day of February 1929) in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subject to the superintendence of the said High Court where the Judge who passed the judgment declares that the case is a fit one for appeal.\" 114. The right of appeal which is provided under clause 15 of the Letters d Patent cannot be said to be restricted. 115. In Subal Paul v. Malina Paul47 this Court held: \"32. While detennining the question as regards clause 15 of the Letters Patent, the court is required to see as to whether the order sought to be appealed against is a judgment within the meaning thereof or not. Once it is held that irrespective of the nature of the order, meaning e thereby whether interlocutory or final, a judgment has been rendered, clause 15 of the Letters Patent would be attracted. 33. The Supreme Court in Shah Babula[ Khimji case 46 deprecated a very narrow interpretation of the word 'judgment' within the meaning of clause 15. 34. This Court said: (SCC pp. 45-46, para 82) f 'A court is not justified in interpreting a legal tenn which amounts to a complete distortion of the word \"judgment\" so as to deny appeals even against unjust orders to litigants having genuine grievances so as to make them scapegoats in the garb of protecting vexatious appeals. In such cases, a just balance must be struck so as to advance the object of the statute and give the desired relief to the g litigants, if possible.' 35. In Shah Babula[ Khimji case46 the Apex Court in no uncertain terms referred to the judgment under the special Act which confers additional jurisdiction on the High Court even in internal appeals from an order passed by the trial Judge to a larger Bench.

Clause 15 of the Letters Patent confers a right of appeal on a litigant against any judgment passed under a any Act unless the same is expressly excluded. Clause 15 may be subject to an Act but when it is not so subject to the special provision the power and jurisdiction of the High Court under clause 15 to entertain any appeal from a judgment would be effective. b C d e f g h * * * 38. The decision of this Court in Shah Babula[ Khimji case46 has been considered in some detail by a Special Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Tanusree Art Printers v. Rabindra Nath Pal48• It was pointed out: (CHN p. 233, para 67) If the right of appeal is a creature of a statute, the same would be governed by the said statute. Whether an appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent will be maintainable or not when the matter is governed by a special statute will also have to be judged from the scheme thereof. (e.g. despite absence of bar, a letters patent appeal will not be maintainable from a judgment of the learned Single Judge rendered under the Representation of the People Act.) 39. It was pointed out that in Shah Babula[ Khimji case46 this Court posed three questions namely: (CHN p. 227, para 42) (J) Whether in view of clause 15 of the Letters Patent an appeal under Section 104 of the Code of Civil Procedure would lie? (2) Whether clause 15 of the Letters Patent supersedes Order 43 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure? (3) Even Section 104 of the Code of Civil Procedure has no application, whether an order refusing to grant injunction or appoint a receiver would be a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent? 40. The Apex Court answered each of them from a different angle: (CHN p. 227, para 43) (a) Section 104 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with Order 43 Rule 1 expressly authorizes a forum of appeal against orders falling under various clauses of Order 43 Rule 1 to a larger Bench of a High Court without at all disturbing interference with or overriding the letters patent jurisdiction. (b) Having regard to the provisions of Section 117 and Order 49 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure which excludes various other provisions from the jurisdiction of the High Court, it does not exclude Order 43 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (c) There is no inconsistency between Section 104 read with Order 43 Rule 1 and the appeals under Letters Patent, as Letters Patent in any way does not exclude or override the application under Section 104 read with Order 43 Rule 1 which shows that these 48 (2000) 2 CHN 213 and (2000) 2 CHN 843 (SB) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In Prataprai N. Kothari v. John Braganza49 even in a suit for possession only not based on title, a letters patent appeal was held to be maintainable. 48. The decision of this Court in Sharda Devi v. State of Bihar5° is a also to the same effect, wherein in para 9 it was held: (SCC p. 709) b '9. A Letters Patent is the charter under which the High Court is established. The powers given to a High Court under the Letters Patent are akin to the constitutional powers of a High Court. Thus when a Letters Patent grants to the High Court a power of appeal, against a judgment of a Single Judge, the right to entertain the appeal would not get excluded unless the statutory enactment concerned c excludes an appeal under the Letters Patent.' 49. Section 54 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 provides for an appeal before the High Court and thereafter to the Supreme Court and despite the same it was held that a letters patent appeal under clause 15 would be maintainable.\" (SCC pp. 374-75, paras 47-49) 116. The view taken by the Calcutta and Bombay High Courts that an d order passed in terms of Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure granting leave to defend would not be a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent may not be of much relevance. 117. In Tanusree Art Printers v. Rabindra Nath Pal48 it has been noticed: (CHN p. 229, para 53) \"53. In Merchants of Traders (P) Ltd. v. Sarmon (P) Ltd. 51 learned e Division Bench although did not consider this aspect of the matter but held that an order passed in terms of Order 37 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure will not be appealable.\" 118. Reliance by Mr Pratap upon a decision of the Calcutta High Court in Prahladrai Agmwalla v. Renuka Pal45 wherein it has been held that an order under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure refusing to reject f a plaint is not a judgment, is not apposite. 119. In the said judgment, however, the judgment of this Court in Shah Babula[ Khimji46 was not taken into consideration. The ratio of the decision of this Court in Shah Babula[ Khimji46 as regard scope and ambit of the word \"judgment\" had not been noticed by the Calcutta High Court. 120.

The contention that an order refusing to reject a plaint is one akin to an order amending the plaint would not be a correct proposition of law. 122. The question as to whether the defendant despite such an order refusing to reject a plaint will have a right to show that the case is false would again be of no consequence. The said submission, in our opinion, is based on a wrong premise. 123. An order refusing to grant leave to a defendant to defend the suit would be passed when it is found that the defence is a moonshine. 124. Clause 15 of the Letters Patent is not a special statute. Only in a case where there exists an express prohibition in the matter of maintainability of an intra-court appeal, the same may not be held to be maintainable. But in the event there does not exist any such prohibition and if the order will otherwise be a \"judgment\" within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent, an appeal shall be maintainable. 125. What would be a judgment is stated in Shah Babula! Khimji46 as under: (SCC p. 45, paras 80-81) \"80 . ... 'We think that \"judgment\" in clause 15 means a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability. It may be either final, or preliminary, or interlocutory, the difference between them being that a final judgment determines the whole cause or suit, and a preliminary or interlocutory judgment determines only a part of it, leaving other matters to be determined.' 81. An analysis of the observations of the Chief Justice would reveal that the following tests were laid down by him in order to decide whether or not an order passed by the trial Judge would be a judgment: (J) a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties; (2) by determining some right or liability; (3) the order determining the right or liability may be final, preliminary or interlocutory, but the determination must be final or one which decides even a part of the controversy finally leaving other matters to be decided later.\" 126. In Lea Badin v. Upendra Mohan Roy Choudhury52 the Calcutta High Court held that an order refusing to appoint a Receiver is determinative of a right of the plaintiff and would accordingly be a judgment. 127. Yet again in Chittaranjan Monda! v. Sankar Prasad Sahani53 the Calcutta High Court held that an order refusing to grant an injunction restraining execution of the judgment-debtor was a judgment within the meaning of clause 15. 52 AIR 1935 Cal 35: 39 CWN 155 53 AIR 1972 Cal 469: 76 CWN 781 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

As by reason of an order passed under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the rights conferred upon the parties are determined one way or the other, stricto sensu it would not be an interlocutory order but a having regard to its traits and trappings would be a preliminary judgment. 129. It is true that in Shah Babula[ Khimji46 it is stated that an order rejecting the plaint would be appealable but it does not expressly state that an order refusing to reject would not be appealable. Therein this Court gave 15 instances where an order would be appealable which are only illustrative in nature. b 130. Such observations have to be understood having regard to the concept of finality which is of three types: (J) a final judgment; (2) a preliminary judgment; and (3) intermediary or interlocutory judgment. 131. In our opinion an order refusing to reject the plaint falls in the category of a preliminary judgrnent and is covered by the second category carved out by this Court. 132. It is trite that a party should not be unnecessarily harassed in a suit. An order refusing to reject a plaint will finally determine his right in terms of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. C d 133. The idea underlying Order 7 Rule ll(a) is that when no cause of action is disclosed, the courts will not unnecessarily protract the hearing of a suit. Having regard to the changes in the legislative policy as adumbrated by the amendments carried out in the Code of Civil Procedure, the courts would interpret the provisions in such a manner so as to save expenses, achieve expedition and avoid the court's resources being used up on cases which will e serve no useful purpose. A litigation which in the opinion of the court is doomed to fail would not further be allowed to be used as a device to harass a litigant. (See Azhar Hussain v. Rajiv Gandhi54 SCC at pp. 324-35.) 134. In Dhartipakar Madan Lal Aga,wal v. Rajiv Gandhi55 this Court held: (SCC p. 104, para 9) f \"9. In K. Kamaraja Nadar v. Kunju Thevar56 the Election Tribunal and the High Court both refused to consider preliminary objections raised by the returned candidate at the initial stage on the ground that the same would be considered at the trial of the election petition.

It would mean unnecessary harassment and expenses for the appellant which could certainly be avoided if the preliminary objection urged by him was decided at the initial stage by the Election Tribunal.\" It was opined that in a given case a full-dressed trial need not be undertaken. 135. Yet again in Samar Singh v. Kedar Nath 57 it has been held: (SCC p. 665, para 4) \"In substance, the argument is that the court must proceed with the trial, record the evidence, and only after the trial of the election petition is concluded that the powers under the Code of Civil Procedure for dealing appropriately with the defective petition which does not disclose cause of action should be exercised. With respect to the learned counsel, it is an argument which it is difficult to comprehend. The whole purpose of conferment of such powers is to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless and bound to prove abortive should not be permitted to occupy the time of the court and exercise the mind of the respondent.\" 136. We may notice a converse case. In Dipak Chandra Ruhidas v. Chandan Kumar Sarkar5 8 in view of Section 98(a) and Section 116-A of the Representation of the People Act, a question arose as to whether dismissing an election petition at the threshold shall be appealable. This Court observed: (SCC pp. 72-73, paras 13-16) \"13. Furthermore, Section 86 deals with trial of election petitions, sub-section (1) whereof is a part of it. Trial has not been defined. In Black's Law Dictionary at p. 1348, it is stated: 'A judicial examination and determination of issues between parties to action, Gulf, C. & S.F. Rly. Co. v.

It is, therefore, not necessary that the trial must be a full-dressed a or a jury trial or a trial which concludes only after taking evidence of the parties in support of their respective cases. 15. Section 116-A provides for an appeal. The said provision must be given a liberal and purposive construction. The scope of an appeal should be held to be wider than an application for judicial review or a petition under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. b 16. Furthermore, the Representation of the People Act provides for a complete machinery. The right of appeal conferred upon a suitor must be considered from that angle. When an order is passed under Section 98 of the Act, the same may be in terms of either sub-section (1) of Section 86 or otherwise. An appeal lies against a final order. An order passed under sub-section (1) of Section 86 is also final. It may be that in the event an c appeal therefrom is allowed, the matter may be required to be sent back but that would not render an order passed thereunder as an interlocutory one. It does not take away the concept of the finality attached therewith.\" 137. In Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Ltd. v. Union of India61 this Court upon referring Shah Babula[ Khimji46 held: (SCC p. 594, d para 15) \"15. Adverting to the facts of this case, Section 17-B of the ID Act confers valuable rights on the workmen and correspondingly imposes onerous obligations on the employer. The order in question passed by the learned Single Judge detem1ines the entitlement of the workmen to receive benefits and imposes an obligation on the appellant to pay such e benefits provided in the said section. That order cannot but be 'judgment' within the meaning of clause 10 of Letters Patent, Patna. The High Court is obviously in error in holding that the said order is not judgment within the meaning of clause 10 of the Letters Patent of Patna.\" 138. We, therefore, are of the opinion that letters patent appeal was maintainable. f Rejection of plaint 139. Whether a plaint discloses a cause of action or not is essentially a question of fact. But whether it does or does not must be found out from reading the plaint itself. For the said purpose the averments made in the plaint in their entirety must be held to be correct. The test is as to whether if the averments made in the plaint are taken to be correct in their entirety, a g decree would be passed. Cause of action 140.

(4) Nothing in this rule shall apply to document produced for the cross- examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, or, handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory.\" 142. In the instant case the Club not only annexed certain documents with the plaint but also filed a large number of documents therewith. Those documents having regard to Order 7 Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure are required to be taken into consideration for the purpose of disposal of application under Order 7 Rule 1 l(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Club in its plaint pleaded: \"The plaintiff is a Protection and Indemnity Association incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom and carries on business through its Managers, Liverpool & London P&I Management Ltd. at Liverpool, UK. The plaintiff is a mutual association of shipowners and offers insurance cover in respect of vessels entered with it for diverse third-party risks associated with the operation and trading of vessels. This insurance is commonly known as protection and indemnity (P&I) cover in respect of various risks associated with the vessels in their maritime adventure. The 1st defendant vessel M. V. Sea Success I is a sister ship of the vessels Sea Ranger and Sea Glory which were entered for P&I risks with the plaintiff Association . The said two vessels were entered into the plaintiff's Association for the policy year 1999-2000 by Defendant 2 Singapore Soviet Shipping Co. Pte. Ltd. who, as per the terms of the insurance and rules of the plaintiff Association, were recognized and considered to be the owners of the said two vessels and the assured under the policy of insurance. The 1st defendant vessel is owned and/or controlled by Defendant 2 through its wholly owned 100% subsidiary, Singapore Soviet Shipping Corporation Inc., Monrovia. The 1st defendant vessel is presently at the port and harbour of Mumbai within the territorial waters of India and within the admiralty jurisdiction of this Hon 'ble Court. The 2nd defendant is the owner of the 1st defendant and is also inter alia the party liable in personam in respect of the plaintiff's claim. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The plaintiff further submits that Defendant 2 is liable in personam in respect of the unpaid insurance premium in respect of the two vessels Sea Glory and Sea Ranger. Consequently, the plaintiff is entitled to arrest any other vessel in the ownership of Defendant 2. The 1 st defendant vessel is owned by Defendant 2 through its 100% subsidiary S.S. Shipping Co. Inc. In the b circumstances, the plaintiff submits that they are entitled to proceed against the defendant vessel in rem and are entitled to an order of arrest, detention and sale of the vessel for recovery of their outstanding dues in respect of insurance premium as more particularly stated above. The plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to have the defendant vessel along with her hull, gear, engines, tackle, machinery, bunkers, plant, apparel, furniture, C equipments and all appurtenances thereto condemned and arrested under a warrant of arrest of this Hon'ble Court for realization of the plaintiff's dues. The plaintiff is further entitled to have the defendant vessel sold under the orders and directions of this Hon'ble Court and to have the sale proceeds thereof applied towards the satisfaction of the plaintiff's claim in the suit. The plaintiff is entitled to an order of arrest of the defendant vessel as arrest is the only method of proceeding against the said vessel d in rem. The plaintiff submits that if such an order of arrest is not granted, irreparable harm and injury will be caused to the plaintiff inasmuch as the plaintiff's suit will be rendered infructuous. There is no other alternative efficacious remedy available to the plaintiff.\" 143. The Club has pleaded that the Vessel is a sister ship of Sea Ranger and Sea Glory owned and possessed by the second defendant. The Club has e also pleaded that Defendant 2 is beneficial owner of the first defendant ship. Determination on such assertions would amount to determination of question of fact. If the \"Vessel\" denies or disputes the same, an issue in that behalf will have to be framed and decided. 144. Beneficial ownership of a ship is not a question of fact alone. It is a mixed question of fact and law. In Williams v. Wilcox6 2 (Ad & E at p. 331) it f is held: (ER p. 863) \"It is an elementary rule in pleading, that, when a state of facts is relied on, it is enough to allege it simply, without setting out the subordinate facts which are the means of producing it, or the evidence sustaining the allegation.\" 145. The aforementioned dicta has been quoted with approval in Mohan 9 Rawale v. Damodar Tatyaba63 • 146. It may be true that Order 7 Rule 1 l(a) although authorises the court to reject a plaint on failure on the part of the plaintiff to disclose a cause of action but the same would not mean that the averments made therein or a 62 (1838) 8 Ad & E 314 : 112 ER 857 63 (1994) 2 sec 392 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

SEA SUCCESS I (Sinha, J.) 565 document upon which reliance has been placed although discloses a cause of action, the plaint would be rejected on the ground that such averments are not sufficient to prove the facts stated therein for the purpose of obtaining reliefs claimed in the suit. The approach adopted by the High Court, in this behalf, in our opinion, is not correct. 147. In D. Ramachandran v. R. V. Janakiraman64 this Court held: (SCC p. 271, para 8) \"It is well settled that in all cases of preliminary objection, the test is to see whether any of the reliefs prayed for could be granted to the appellant if the averments made in the petition are proved to be true. For the purpose of considering a preliminary objection, the averments in the petition should be assumed to be true and the court has to find out whether those averments disclose a cause of action or a triable issue as such. The court cannot probe into the facts on the basis of the controversy raised in the counter.\" 148. Furthermore a fact which is within the special knowledge of the defendant need not be pleaded in the plaint. In Punit Rai v. Dinesh Chaudhary65 it is stated: (SCC p. 216, para 16) \"These are the material facts relating to the plea raised by the appellant that the respondent is not a Scheduled Caste. We don't think if the respondent means to say that the petitioner should have stated in the petition that the respondent is not born of Deo Kumari Devi said to be married to Bhagwan Singh in Village Adai. If at all these facts would be in the special knowledge of the respondent, Bhagwan Singh and Deo Kumari Devi hence were not required to be pleaded in the election petition. It is not possible as well. In this connection, a reference may be made to a decision of this Court in Balwan Singh v. Lakshmi Narain66 • This case also relates to an election matter and it was held that facts which are in the special knowledge of the other party could not be pleaded by the election petitioner. It was found that particulars of the arrangement of hiring or procuring a vehicle would never be in the knowledge of the petitioner, such facts need not and cannot be pleaded in the petition.\" 149. In D. Ramachandran v. R. V. Janakiraman64 it has been held that the court cannot dissect the pleading into several parts and consider whether each one of them discloses a cause of action. 150. In the aforementioned backdrop, the question as to whether the Club had been able to show that Respondent 1 is a sister ship of Sea Glory and Sea Ranger admittedly belonging to the first respondent is a matter which is required to be gone into in the suit. 151. In ascertaining whether the plaint shows a cause of action, the court is not required to make an elaborate enquiry into doubtful or complicated questions of law or fact. By the statute the jurisdiction of the court is 64 (1999) 3 sec 267 65 (2003) s sec 204: JT 2003 Supp (1) sc 557 66 AIR 1960 SC 770 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 566 SUPREME COURT CASES (2004) 9 sec restricted to ascertammg whether on the allegations a cause of action is shown. In Vijai Pratap Singh v. Dukh Haran Nath Singh67 this Court held: (AIR pp. 943-44, para 9) a \"By the express tenns of Rule 5 clause (d), the court is concerned to ascertain whether the allegations made in the petition show a cause of action. The court has not to see whether the claim made by the petitioner is likely to succeed: it has merely to satisfy itself that the allegations made in the petition, if accepted as true, would entitle the petitioner to the relief he claims. If accepting those allegations as true no case is made b out for granting relief no cause of action would be shown and the petition must be rejected. But in ascertaining whether the petition shows a cause of action the court does not enter upon a trial of the issues affecting the merits of the claim made by the petitioner. It cannot take into consideration the defences which the defendant may raise upon the merits; nor is the court competent to make an elaborate enquiry into c doubtful or complicated questions of law or fact. If the allegations in the petition, prima facie, show a cause of action, the court cannot embark upon an enquiry whether the allegations are true in fact, or whether the petitioner will succeed in the claims made by him.\" 152. So long as the claim discloses some cause of action or raises some questions fit to be decided by a judge, the mere fact that the case is weak and d not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out. The purported failure of the pleadings to disclose a cause of action is distinct from the absence of full particulars. (See Mohan Rawale63 .) 153. Beneficial ownership is not a pure question of fact. It is a mixed question of law and fact. In that view of the matter it was not necessary for the Club to set out the subordinate facts which are means of proving it or the e evidence sustaining the allegations. The High Court, however, in its order rejecting the plaint held: \"We have not gone into the merits of Defendant 1 ship, we clarify, on the basis of any averments made by Defendant 1, to the contrary, but we have proceeded to examine the same on the basis of the averments made in the plaint to find out whether, as they stand, prove Defendant 1 vessel f Sea Success I to be sister ship of vessels Sea Glory and Sea Ranger being beneficially owned by Defendant 2. We have already indicated above that the allegations made in the plaint by themselves do not prove factum of Defendant 1 Sea Success I being sister ship of vessels Sea Glory and Sea Ranger in respect of whom the claim has been raised in the suit, we find it difficult to approve the view of the learned Single Judge in this regard. It cannot be overlooked that ship is a valuable commercial chattel and her g arrest undeservingly severely prejudices third parties innocently as well as affect the interest of owner, crew member, cargo-owner, shipper etc. adversely and, therefore, it is all the more necessary to analyse the plaint meaningfully at the threshold to find out whether it discloses cause of h 67 AIR 1962 SC 941 : 1962 All LJ 634 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

SEA SUCCESS I (Sinha, J.) 567 action or not and not on technical and fonnal reading that if (sic it) discloses cause of action and wait for trial.\" 154. The approach of the High Court, in our considered opinion, is not correct. For the purpose of rejecting a plaint it is not necessary to consider whether the averments made in the plaint prove the factum that Defendant 1 Sea Success I is a sister ship of Sea Glory and Sea Ranger or the said two ships are beneficially owned by Defendant 2. The reasons which have been assigned in support of the said aforementioned finding that the ship is a valuable commercial chattel and her arrest undeservingly prejudices third parties as well as affects the interest of the owner and others is a question which must be gone into when passing a final order as regard interim arrest of the ship or otherwise. For the aforementioned purpose the Vessel herein could file an application for vacation of stay. While considering such an application, the Court was entitled to consider not only a prima facie case but also the elements of balance of convenience and irreparable injury involved in the matter. In such a situation and particularly when both the parties disclose their documents which are in their possession, the Court would be in a position to ascertain even prima facie as to whether the Club has been able to make out that Sea Glory and Sea Ranger are sister vessels of the \"Vessel\". 155. The reason for the aforementioned conclusion is that if a legal question is raised by the defendant in the written statement, it does not mean that the same has to be decided only by way of an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure which may amount to prejudging the matter. 156. Furthermore, the question as to whether the asset of a 100% subsidy can be treated as an asset of the parent company would again depend upon the fact situation of each case. 157. In Aventicum, The68 it has been held: \"I have no doubt that on a motion of this kind it is right to investigate the true beneficial ownership. I reject any suggestion that it is impossible 'to pierce the corporate veil'. I of course remember, as Mr Howard urges, the case of Salomon v. Salomon & Co. 69 but of course it is plain that Section 3( 4) of the Act intends that the court shall not be limited to a consideration of who is the registered owner or who is the person having legal ownership of the shares in the ship; the directions are to look at the beneficial ownership. Certainly in a case where there is a suggestion of a trusteeship or a nominee holding, there is no doubt that the court can investigate it. I think that it may well be, without having to resolve the difference of opinion expressed by Mr Justice Brandon and Mr Justice Goff in the two cases to which I have referred that the court has the power and should in some cases look even further.\" 158. Yet again in Andrea Ursula, The70 the Court opined: (All ER p. 824c-e) 68 (1978) 1 Lloyd ' s Rep 184 69 1897 AC 22: (1895-99) All ER Rep 33 (HL) 70 (1971) 1 Lloyd's Rep 145: (1971) 1 All ER 821 : 1973 QB 265: (1971) 2 WLR 681 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 568 SUPREME COURT CASES (2004) 9 sec \"There is no definition in the Act of the expression 'beneficially owned' as used in Section 3(4). It could mean owned by someone who, whether he is the legal owner or not, is in any case the equitable owner. a That would cover both the case of a ship the legal and equitable title to which are in one person, A, and also the case of a ship the legal title to which is in one person, A, but the equitable title to which is in another person, B. In the first case the ship would be beneficially owned by A, and in the second case by B. Trusts of ships, express or implied, are, however, rare, and the words seem to me to be capable also of a different b and more practical meaning related not to title, legal or equitable, but to lawful possession and control with the use and benefit which are derived from them. If that meaning were right, a ship would be beneficially owned by a person who, whether he was the legal or equitable owner or not, lawfully had full possession and control of her, and, by virtue of such possession and control, had all the benefit and use of her which a c legal or equitable owner would ordinarily have.\" 159. Furthermore, the question as to whether the concept of ownership of a ship which has been introduced in the 18th century when there had been no joint stock companies and the concept of shares in a ship so as to encourage individuals to pool their resources by a sister ship so that they may become co-owners is a matter which is required to be considered at an appropriate d stage. We do not think that such a question can justifiably be gone into at this stage. 160. We do not intend to delve deep into the questions as to whether the two ships named hereinabove are the sister ships of Respondent 1 vessel or whether the requirement of law as regard ownership of a ship in Respondent 1 as beneficial owner has been fulfilled or not. Such issues must be e considered at an appropriate stage. Conclusion 161. We, therefore, direct that in the event, a proper application is filed either for dissolution of the interim order of injunction passed by the learned Single Judge or if the High Court in its wisdom thinks fit to decide any issue as a preliminary issue such questions may be gone into in greater details. Any f observations made by us must be considered to have been made only for the purpose of disposal of these appeals and not for the purpose of determining the merit of the matter. However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, we will request the High Court to consider the desirability of disposing of the matter as expeditiously as possible and preferably within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy 9 of this order. 162. For the reasons aforementioned, the judgment under challenge is set aside and the matter is sent back to the High Court. Civil Appeal No. 5665 of 2002 is accordingly allowed and Civil Appeal No. 5666 of 2002 is dismissed. No costs. h","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
