The appellant raised a revised final bill for the aforesaid work on 10-7-2012. The payment in respect of the final bill was made to the appellant on 29-4-2013.

The application was opposed by the respondents inter alia on the ground that the entire amount due and payable under the final bill was paid as far as back on 29-4-2013 and that even the appellant issued the \"no further claim\" certificate and therefore, on the ground of \"accord and satisfaction\", the dispute is not required to be sent for arbitration.

SERVICE 331 consider only whether there is an existence of the arbitration agreement or not and no further inquiry is permissible at the stage of deciding the application under Section 11(6) and the issue with respect to the \"accord and satisfaction\" has to be left to be decided by the arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, it was the case on behalf of the appellant that the provisions of the 2015 Amendment Act shall be applicable. The appellant inter alia contended that the said issue was squarely covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in BCCI, (2018) 6 SCC 287 . It was inter alia also a specific case on behalf of the appellant that as the decisions in Parmar, (2019) 15 SCC 682 and Pradeep Vinod, (2020) 2 SCC 464 are per incuriam, the Court must hold that in the present case Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable and therefore the High Court has committed a very serious error in opining on accord and satisfaction which is not permissible as per the 2015 Amendment Act i.e. Section 11(6-A). Sections 21 and 26 of the 1996 Act/the 2015 Amendment Act, respectively, relevant for the purpose read as under: The 1996Act \"21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings.-Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent.\" Amendment Act of 2015 \"26. Act not to apply to pending arbitral proceedings.-Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree but this Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this Act.\" The issue involved in this appeal was whether in Section 11 proceedings, where the notice invoking arbitration is issued prior to the coming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act, the pre-amended 1996 Act shall be applicable as it stood prior to the 2015 Amendment Act, or, the 1996 Act as amended thereby? Held: The position of law that prevails after insertion of Section 11(6-A) is that the Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under Sections 11(4) to 11(6) is to confine itself to examination of existence of arbitration agreement, nothing more, nothing less, and leave all other preliminary issues to be decided by the arbitrator.

Pradyuat Deb Burman, (2019) 8 SCC 714: (2019) 4 SCC (Civ) 441, followed In BCCI, (2018) 6 SCC 287, it is held that the 2015 Amendment Act is prospective in nature. The scheme of Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act as clarified in BCCI case is as follows: that the 2015 Amendment Act is prospective in nature, and will apply to those arbitral proceedings that are commenced, as understood under Section 21 of the principal Act, on or after commencement of the 2015 Amendment Act, and to Court proceedings which have commenced on or after the 2015 Amendment Act came into force.

(Para 23) BCCI v.

The facts leading to the present appeal in a nutshell are as under: that the appellant herein and the respondents entered into an agreement vide agreement dated 22-7-2010 for additions/alterations to Senior Non- Commissioned Officers mess and repairs/renewals to floors in tech area at Air Force Academy, Hyderabad.

The appellant preferred an application under Section 11(6) of the 1996 d Act before the High Court on 27-4-2016 and prayed to appoint an arbitrator. The application was opposed by the respondents inter alia on the ground that the entire amount due and payable under the final bill was paid as far as back on 29-4-2013 and that even the appellant issued the \"no further claim\" certificate and therefore, on the ground of \"accord and satisfaction\", the dispute is not required to be sent for arbitration. However, it was the case on behalf of the appellant that in view of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) e Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as \"the 2015 Amendment Act\") by which Section 11 (6-A) came to be inserted, while deciding the application under Section 11 ( 6), the Court would have a very limited jurisdiction and to consider only whether there is an existence of the arbitration agreement or not and no further inquiry is permissible at the stage of deciding the application under Section 11(6) and the issue with respect to the \"accord and satisfaction\" has to f be left to be decided by the arbitrator/ Arbitral Tribunal.

The impugned judgment and order1 passed by the High Court is the subject-matter of the present appeal. 6. Shri K. Parameshwar, learned counsel has appeared on behalf of the appellant. 6.1. It is submitted by Shri Parameshwar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the issue that arises for consideration in the present appeal is the interpretation of Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act insofar as the applicability of the amended provisions, more specifically, insertion of Section 11(6-A) and its applicability to judicial proceedings initiated after the 2015 Amendment Act came into force w.e.f. 23-10-2015. 6.2. Shri Parameshwar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has vehemently submitted that as such the aforesaid issue is squarely covered by the decision of this Court in BCCI v. Kochi Cricket ( P) Ltd. 2, SCC paras 37 and 39. 6.3. Relying upon the aforesaid decision, it is submitted that in the said decision it is specifically observed and held by this Court that the 2015 Amendment Act shall be applicable prospectively and that even in a case where the arbitration proceedings were initiated as per Section 21 of the Act, prior to the 2015 Amendment Act, the 2015 Amendment Act shall be applicable. 6.4. It is further submitted that this Court in BCC/2 had the occasion to analyse and interpret Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act. The Court specifically traced the legislative history and thereafter came to the conclusion that Section 26 is divided into two parts. The first part applies to arbitral proceedings before the arbitrator and the second part applies to the proceedings in relation to arbitral proceedings, which means judicial proceedings. The Court held as follows: (SCC pp. 313-14, paras 38-39) \"38. That the expression \"the arbitral proceedings\" refers to proceedings before an Arbitral Tribunal is clear from the heading of Chapter V of the 1996 Act, which reads as follows: \"Conduct of arbitral proceedings\" The entire chapter consists of Sections 18 to 27 dealing with the conduct of arbitral proceedings before an Arbitral Tribunal. What is also important to notice is that these proceedings alone are referred to, the expression \"to\" as contrasted with the expression \"in relation to\" making this clear.

Also, since the conduct of arbitral proceedings is largely procedural in nature, a parties may \"otherwise agree\" and apply the Amendment Act to arbitral proceedings that have commenced before the Amendment Act came into force. 3 In stark contrast to the first part of Section 26 is the second part, where the Amendment Act is made applicable \"in relation to\" arbitral proceedings which commenced on or after the date of commencement of the Amendment Act. What is conspicuous by its absence in the second part b is any reference to Section 21 of the 1996 Act. Whereas the first part refers only to arbitral proceedings before an Arbitral Tribunal, the second part refers to Court proceedings \"in relation to\" arbitral proceedings, and it is the commencement of these Court proceedings that is referred to in the second part of Section 26, as the words \"in relation to the arbitral proceedings\" in the second part are not controlled by the application of Section 21 of the c 1996 Act. 39. Section 26, therefore, bifurcates proceedings, as has been stated above, with a great degree of clarity, into two sets of proceedings - arbitral proceedings themselves, and Court proceedings in relation thereto. The reason why the first part of Section 26 is couched in negative form is only to state that the Amendment Act will apply even to arbitral proceedings d commenced before the amendment if parties otherwise agree. If the first part of Section 26 were couched in positive language (like the second part), it would have been necessary to add a proviso stating that the Amendment Act would apply even to arbitral proceedings commenced e 3 Per R.F. Nariman, J.-Section 29-A of the Amended Act provides for time-limits within which an arbitral award is to be made. In Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra , (1994) 4 SCC 602 at p. 633 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 1087, this Court stated: (SCC p. 633, para 26) \"26 . ... (iii) Every litigant has a vested right in substantive law but no such right exists in procedural law. (iv) A procedural statute should not generally speaking be applied retrospectively where the result would be to create new disabilities or obligations or to impose new duties in respect of transactions already accomplished. (v) A statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates new rights and liabilities shall be construed to be prospective in operation, unless otherwise provided, either expressly or by necessary implication.\" It is, inter alia, because timelines for the making of an arbitral award have been laid down for the first time in Section 29-A of the Amended Act that parties were given the option to adopt such timelines which, though procedural in nature, create new obligations in respect of a proceeding already begun under the unamended Act. This is, of course, only one example of why parties may otherwise agree and apply the new procedure laid down by the Amendment Act to arbitral proceedings that have commenced before it came into force. f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In either case, the intention of the legislature remains the same, the negative form conveying exactly what could have been stated positively, with the necessary proviso. Obviously, \"arbitral proceedings\" having been subsumed in the first part cannot re- appear in the second part, and the expression \"in relation to arbitral proceedings\" would, therefore, apply only to Court proceedings which relate to the arbitral proceedings. The scheme of Section 26 is thus clear: that the Amendment Act is prospective in nature, and will apply to those arbitral proceedings that are commenced, as understood by Section 21 of the principal Act, on or after the Amendment Act, and to Court proceedings which have commenced on or after the Amendment Act came into force.\" 6.5. It is further submitted that it is specifically held that the phrase \"in relation to arbitral proceedings\" appearing in the second part of Section 26 refers to commencement of Court proceedings and are not controlled by Section 21 of the principal Act. It is submitted that in such circumstances, the relevant date so far as the applicability of Section 11(6-A) is concerned, is not the date of invocation of arbitration but the date of commencement of judicial proceedings before a court under Section 11. It is submitted that therefore viewed in this light, the finding of the High Court that Section 11(6-A) shall not be applicable in the present case is clearly erroneous. 6.6. It is submitted that in Union of India v. Parmar Construction Co. 4 (two-Judge Bench) (paras 25-27), without noticing the judgment in BCCF, a coordinate Bench has held, relying on Section 21, that, the relevant date for applicability of Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act is the date when request for appointment of arbitrator was made. It is further submitted that this has been followed in the judgment in Union of India v. Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5 (three-Judge Bench), which also did not refer to the case of BCCF but has only followed the judgment in Parmar Construction Co. 4 6.7. It is submitted that the judgment in BCCF was rendered in the context of Section 36 of the Act and not in the context of Section 11. Both Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5 and Parmar Construction Co. 4 were cases relating to Section 11. However, neither of the case distinguished the second part of Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act as relating to judicial proceedings. It is further submitted that, in Parmar Construction Co. 4, reliance was placed on Aravali Power Co. (P) Ltd. v. Era Infra Engg. Ltd. 6 , SCC para 22, to examine the effect of Section 21 of the principal Act read with Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act.

It is submitted that therefore, the second part of Section 26 did not come for consideration at all. 6.8. It is submitted that similarly, the reliance placed in Parmar Construction Co. 4 on S.P. Singla Constructions (P) Ltd. v. State of H.P. 7 , SCC para 16 is again misplaced because in S.P. Singla Constructions7 issue also b involved was disqualifications of an arbitrator under Section 12 and consequent filing of Section 11 petitions prior to coming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act. 6.9. It is submitted that on the other hand, this Court in Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAJ8, SCC para 19, has held that, Section 34 as amended in 2015, will apply only to Section 34 applications that have been c made to the Court on or after 23-10-2015, irrespective of the fact that the arbitration proceedings may have commenced prior to that date and while doing so, this Court followed the judgment in BCC/2. 6.10. It is submitted that in order to get over the judgment in BCC/2, Parliament omitted Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act w.e.f. 23-10-2015 by way of Section 15 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019, which was notified on 30-8-2019. It is further submitted that the validity of Section 15 was inter alia challenged in Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. v. Union of India9 (three-Judge Bench). It is submitted that this Court held that, though the basis for the judgment in BCC/2 was removed, but still found that Section 15 of the 2019 Amendment Act was unconstitutional as being manifestly arbitrary. What is noteworthy is that despite having noticed that the Justice Srikrishna Committee Report held that the 2015 Amendment Act must apply to arbitrations, which commenced on or after 23-10-2015 and related Court proceedings, the Court struck down the amendment and resurrected the law as stated in BCC/2. The Court emphatically held that: (Hindustan Construction Co. case9 , SCC p. 364, para 66) \"66.

It is further submitted that the judgment in BCC/2, so far as it differentiated between arbitral proceedings and Court proceedings, was followed in Union of India v. Vedanta Ltd_ ID (three-Judge Bench), and the Court emphasised that the 2015 Amendment Act would be applicable to Court proceedings arising out of arbitration proceedings, irrespective of whether such arbitration proceedings commenced prior to or after the 2015 Amendment Act. 6.12. It is further submitted that the judgment in BCC/2 has also been followed in Patel Engg. Ltd. v. North Eastern Electric Power Corpn. Ltd_ I I, SCC para 15 (three-Judge Bench). 6.13. In light of this brief conspectus of the aforesaid decisions, it is submitted that, the decision in BCC/2, regarding judicial proceedings referred to in Section 26 not being controlled by Section 21 of the principal Act, has been followed by a coordinate Bench of this Hon'ble Court in Ssangyong Eng g. & Construction Co. 8 and the three-Judge Benches in Hindustan Construction Co. 9, Vedanta ID and Patel Engg. 11 It is further submitted that on the other hand, the decision by the coordinate Bench in Parmar Construction Co. 4 was rendered in ignorance of the decision in BCC/2. Further, the coordinate Bench in Parmar Construction Co. 4 placed reliance on the decisions in Aravali Power Co. 6 and S.P. Sing la Constructions 7, neither of which concerned judicial proceedings as they were rendered on the issue of qualification or disqualification of the arbitrator. It is further submitted that the decision in Parmar Construction Co. 4 was followed by the three-Judge Bench in Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5 without any reference to BCC/2. 6.14. It is therefore, the submission on behalf of the appellant that the decision of this Court in BCC/2 was binding on the coordinate Bench which rendered the decision in Parmar Construction Co. 4, this Court has not noticed the said decision and therefore, the decision in Parmar Construction Co. 4 can be said to be per incuriam and/or sub silentio. It is submitted that therefore, the decision in Parmar Construction Co. 4 being per incuriam, the larger Bench, which rendered the decision in Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5 ought not to have placed reliance on Parmar Construction Co. 4 Therefore, relying upon the decision of this Court in BCC/2, which has been subsequently followed in other decisions referred to hereinabove, it is prayed to allow the present appeal. 2 BCCI v.

It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf a of the respondents that as such the Hon'ble High Court has rightly dismissed the Section 11 ( 6) application by observing and holding that the pre-amendment Arbitration Act, 2015 shall be applicable. 7.2. It is submitted that in the present case, admittedly the notice invoking the arbitration was issued on 20-12-2013 i.e. much prior to the 2015 Amendment Act. It is further submitted that admittedly the application under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act was preferred and filed on 27-4-2016 i.e. much after the 2015 Amendment Act came into force. It is submitted that therefore, taking into consideration Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act and when the notice invoking the arbitration was issued much prior to the 2015 Amendment Act, therefore, the arbitration proceedings can be said to have commenced on 20-12-2013 and therefore, pre-Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable and not the 2015 Amendment Act. 7.3. Now, insofar as the reliance placed upon the decision of this Court in BCCF relied upon on behalf of the appellant is concerned, it is submitted that the decision in BCCF and the subsequent decisions following BCCF are all with respect to the proceedings under Sections 34 and 36 of the 1996 Act. It is submitted that therefore, considering Sections 34 and 36 proceedings as judicial/Court proceedings, this Hon'ble Court has interpreted Section 26, bifurcating Section 26 into two parts and to that it is observed and held that with respect to judicial proceedings under Sections 34 and 36, the 2015 Amendment Act shall be applicable. It is submitted that, however, on the other hand, there is a direct decision of this Hon'ble Court in Parmar Construction Co. 4 dealing with the very issue of application under Section 11 ( 6) of the 1996 Act and in the said decision it is specifically observed and held that so far as the application under Section 11 ( 6) of the 1996 Act is concerned, in case the notice invoking the arbitration is invoked prior to the 2015 Amendment Act, pre-Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable. It is submitted that as such the decision of this Court in Parmar Construction Co. 4, which is a two-Judge Bench decision has been subsequently considered and followed by a three-Judge Bench in Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5 7.4. It is further submitted that in BCCF, this Court has unequivocally held that from the scheme contained in Section 26 of the Amendment Act, it is clear that the Amendment Act is prospective in nature and will only apply to those arbitral proceedings that commence in terms of Section 21 of the Act, on or after the Amendment Act, and to Court proceedings, which have commenced on or after the Amendment Act came into force.

It is submitted that the reliance by the appellant on the expression \"Court proceedings in relation thereto\" as it occurs in Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act to contend that applications under Section 11 of the 1996 Act would fall in such category is misplaced. It is submitted that it must be borne in mind that this Hon'ble Court was called upon to interpret Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act, to answer as to whether applications under Section 36, which was amended by the 2015 Amendment Act would apply in its amended form in respect of Section 34/36 proceedings initiated before the commencement of the 2015 Amendment Act.

[Therefore, as per Section 21 of the principal Act the arbitral proceedings can be said to have commenced on the date on which a request for the dispute to be referred to the arbitration is received by the respondent.](sic)* At this stage, it is required to be noted that by the 2015 Amendment Act, Sections 34 and 36 of the Arbitration Act also came to be amended and the interference of the Court in challenge to the award has been restricted and/or narrowed down. 12.

Pradyuat Deb Burman 13, it is observed and held that the position of law that prevails after insertion of Section 11 ( 6-A) is that the Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under Sections 11 ( 4) to 11 ( 6) is to confine itself to examination of existence of arbitration agreement, nothing more, nothing less, and leave all other preliminary issues to be decided by the arbitrator. 14. In BCCfl, while interpreting Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act, this Court has observed in paras 37 to 39 as under: (SCC pp. 313-14) \"37. What will be noticed, so far as the first part is concerned, which states- '26. Act not to apply to pending arbitral proceedings.-Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree .... ' is that: (1) \"the arbitral proceedings\" and their commencement is mentioned in the context of Section 21 of the principal Act; (2) the expression used is \"to\" and not \"in relation to\"; and (3) parties may otherwise agree. So far as the second part of Section 26 is concerned, namely, the part which reads, ' ... but this Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this Act' makes it clear that the expression \"in relation to\" is used; and the expression \"the\" arbitral proceedings and \"in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act\" is conspicuous by its absence. 38. That the expression \"the arbitral proceedings\" refers to proceedings before an Arbitral Tribunal is clear from the heading of Chapter V of the 1996 Act, which reads as follows: \"Conduct of arbitral proceedings\" The entire chapter consists of Sections 18 to 27 dealing with the conduct of arbitral proceedings before an Arbitral Tribunal. What is also important to notice is that these proceedings alone are referred to, the expression \"to\" as contrasted with the expression \"in relation to\" making this clear. Also, the reference to Section 21 of the 1996 Act, which appears in Chapter V, and which speaks of the arbitral proceedings commencing on the date on which a request for a dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent, would also make it clear that it is these proceedings, and no others, that form the subject-matter of the first part of Section 26. Also, since the conduct of arbitral proceedings is largely procedural in nature, parties may \"otherwise agree\" and apply the Amendment Act to arbitral proceedings that have commenced before the Amendment Act came into 13 (2019) 8 sec 714 : (2019) 4 sec (Civ) 441 2 BCCI v.

Shah, J.) force. 3 In stark contrast to the first part of Section 26 is the second part, where the Amendment Act is made applicable \"in relation to\" arbitral proceedings which commenced on or after the date of commencement of the Amendment Act. What is conspicuous by its absence in the second part is any reference to Section 21 of the 1996 Act. Whereas the first part refers only to arbitral proceedings before an Arbitral Tribunal, the second part refers to Court proceedings \"in relation to\" arbitral proceedings, and it is the commencement of these Court proceedings that is referred to in the second part of Section 26, as the words \"in relation to the arbitral proceedings\" in the second part are not controlled by the application of Section 21 of the 1996 Act. 39. Section 26, therefore, bifurcates proceedings, as has been stated above, with a great degree of clarity, into two sets of proceedings - arbitral proceedings themselves, and Court proceedings in relation thereto. The reason why the first part of Section 26 is couched in negative form is only to state that the Amendment Act will apply even to arbitral proceedings commenced before the amendment if parties otherwise agree. If the first part of Section 26 were couched in positive language (like the second part), it would have been necessary to add a proviso stating that the Amendment Act would apply even to arbitral proceedings commenced before the amendment if the parties agree. In either case, the intention of the legislature remains the same, the negative form conveying exactly what could have been stated positively, with the necessary proviso. Obviously, \"arbitral proceedings\" having been subsumed in the first part cannot re- appear in the second part, and the expression \"in relation to arbitral proceedings\" would, therefore, apply only to Court proceedings which relate to the arbitral proceedings. The scheme of Section 26 is thus clear: that the Amendment Act is prospective in nature, and will apply to those arbitral proceedings that are commenced, as understood by Section 21 of the principal Act, on or after the Amendment Act, and to Court proceedings which have commenced on or after the Amendment Act came into force.\" 15. Thus, in BCCP., it is observed and held that the 2015 Amendment Act is prospective in nature. However, it is required to be noted that in BCCP., this Court was considering the proceedings under Sections 34 and 36 of the 2015 Amendment Act and to that while interpreting Section 26, it is observed that the Amendment Act is prospective in nature, and will apply even to those arbitral proceedings that are commenced, as understood by Section 21 of the principal Act, prior to (sic on or post commencement of)* the Amendment Act, and to Court proceedings which have commenced on or after the Amendment Act came into force. 3 Per R.F. Nariman, J.-Section 29-A of the Amended Act provides for time-limits within which an arbitral award is to be made. [Ed.: see this footnote in full at p. 336e-h, above.] 2 BCCI v.

In Parmar Construction Co. 4, in relation to application under Section 11(6) of the Act, in a case where notice for arbitration is received/ invoked prior to the 2015 Amendment Act, but the application under Section 11(6) of the Act is filed post Amendment Act, 2015, it is observed in paras 25 to 28 as under: (Parmar Construction Co. case4, SCC pp. 698-701) \"25. As on 1-1-2016, the 2015 Amendment Act was gazetted and according to Section 1(2) of the 2015 Amendment Act, it was deemed to have come into force on 23-10-2015. Section 21 of the 1996 Act clearly envisages that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a dispute shall commence from the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent and the plain reading of Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act is self-explicit, leaves no room for interpretation. Sections 21 and 26 of the 1996 Act/the 2015 Amendment Act relevant for the purpose are extracted hereunder: The 1996Act '21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings.-Vnless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent.' Amendment Act of 2015 '26. Act not to apply to pending arbitral proceedings.-Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree but this Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of this Act.' 26. The conjoint reading of Section 21 read with Section 26 leaves no manner of doubt that the provisions of the 2015 Amendment Act shall not apply to such of the arbitral proceedings which have commenced in terms of the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act unless the parties otherwise agree. The effect of Section 21 read with Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act has been examined by this Court in Aravali Power Co. (P) Ltd. v. Era Infra Engg. Ltd. 6 and taking note of Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act laid down the broad principles as under: (SCC p. 53, para 22) \"22. The principles which emerge from the decisions referred to above are: 22.1. In cases governed by the 1996 Act as it stood before the Amendment Act came into force : 4 Union of India v. Parmar Construction Co., (2019) 15 SCC 682: (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 390 6 (2017) 15 sec 32: (2018) 2 sec (Civ) 642 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h SHREE VISHNU CONSTRUCTIONS v. MILITARY ENGG. SERVICE (M.R. Shah, J.) 347 22.1.1. The fact that the named arbitrator is an employee of one of the parties is not ipso facto a ground to raise a presumption of bias or partiality or lack of independence on his part. There can however be a justifiable apprehension about the independence or impartiality of an employee arbitrator, if such person was the controlling or dealing authority in regard to the subject contract or if he is a direct subordinate to the officer whose decision is the subject-matter of the dispute. 22.1.2. Unless the cause of action for invoking jurisdiction under clauses (a), (b) or (c) of sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the 1996 Act arises, there is no question of the Chief Justice or his designate exercising power under sub-section ( 6) of Section 11. 22.1.3. The Chief Justice or his designate while exercising power under sub-section (6) of Section 11 shall endeavour to give effect to the appointment procedure prescribed in the arbitration clause. 22.1.4. While exercising such power under sub-section (6) of Section 11, if circumstances exist, giving rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the person nominated, or if other circumstances warrant appointment of an independent arbitrator by ignoring the procedure prescribed, the Chief Justice or his designate may, for reasons to be recorded ignore the designated arbitrator and appoint someone else. 22.2. In cases governed by the 1996 Act after the Amendment Act has come into force: If the arbitration clause finds foul with the amended provisions, the appointment of the arbitrator even if apparently in conformity with the arbitration clause in the agreement, would be illegal and thus the court would be within its powers to appoint such arbitrator(s) as may be permissible.' which has been further considered in S.P. Singla Constructions case 7: (SCC p. 495, para 16) '16. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are not inclined to go into the merits of this contention of the appellant nor examine the correctness or otherwise of the above view taken by the Delhi High Court in Ratna Infrastructure Projects case 12; suffice it to note that as per Section 26 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, the provisions of the amended 2015 Act shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act before the commencement of the Amendment Act unless the parties otherwise agree.

As per Section 26 of the Act, the provisions of the 2015 Amendment Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date of commencement of the 2015 Amendment Act (w.e.f. 23-10-2015). In the present case, arbitration proceedings commenced way back in 2013, much prior to coming into force of the amended Act and therefore, provisions of the amended Act cannot be invoked.' 27. We are also of the view that the 2015 Amendment Act which came into force i.e. on 23-10-2015, shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings which have commenced in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act, 1996 before the coming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act, unless the parties otherwise agree. 28. In the instant case, the request was made and received by the appellants in the appeal concerned much before the 2015 Amendment Act came into force. Whether the application was pending for appointment of an arbitrator or in the case of rejection because of no claim as in the instant case for appointment of an arbitrator including change/substitution of arbitrator, would not be of any legal effect for invoking the provisions of the 2015 Amendment Act in terms of Section 21 of the principal Act, 1996. In our considered view, the applications/requests made by the respondent contractors deserve to be examined in accordance with the principal Act, 1996 without taking resort to the 2015 Amendment Act which came into force from 23-10-2015.\" In Parmar Construction Co. 4, this Court heavily relied upon para 16 of the decision in S.P.

In Ssangyong Eng g. & Construction Co. 8, in which the decision in BCC/2 was followed, it is observed and held that Section 34, as amended, will apply to only Section 34 applications that have been made to the Court on or after 23-10-2015 irrespective of the fact that the arbitration proceedings may have commenced prior to that date.

It is the case on behalf of the appellant that therefore in BCC/2, the decision which has been subsequently followed in Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. 8 and other decisions, it has been specifically observed and held that the 2015 Amendment Act is prospective in nature. It is the case on behalf of the appellant that while taking a contrary view in Parmar Construction Co. 4 and Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5, this Court had not noticed and/ or considered the binding decision of this Court in BCC/2 and therefore the decisions of this Court in Parmar Construction Co. 4 and Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5 are per incuriam. It is also the case on behalf of the appellant that so far as the decision inAravali Power Co. 6 , which was considered by this Court in Parmar Construction Co. 4 is concerned, in the said decision also, there is no reference to the decision in BCC/2. 20. It is also the case on behalf of the appellant that though in S.P.

Therefore, it is the specific case on behalf of the appellant that as the decisions in Parmar Construction Co. 4 and Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5 are per incuriam, we must hold that in the present case the 2015 Amendment Act shall be applicable and therefore the High Court has committed a very serious error in opining on accord and satisfaction which is not permissible as per the 2015 Amendment Act i.e. Section 11(6-A). 22. The submission on behalf of the appellant, as above, seems to be attractive but has no substance. This Court is required to consider whether the decision in Parmar Construction Co. 4 and Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5 can be said to be per incuriam as the decision of this Court in BCC/2 has not been considered by this Court in the said decisions. However, on a fair reading of the decisions in BCCfl and the observations made in paras 37 to 39 and on a fair reading of decisions in Parmar Construction Co. 4 and Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5, we are of the opinion that this Court in BCC/2 has held that the Arbitration Amendment Act, 2015 is prospective in nature insofar as the proceedings under Sections 34 and 36 are concerned. 2 BCCI v.

It is required to be noted that in BCCfl, application under Section 11(6) was not the subject-matter and there was no issue before the Court that even in a case where the notice invoking the arbitration is issued prior to the 2015 Amendment Act, but the application under Section 11(6) is filed post Amendment Act, 2015, what will be the position and whether the old Act will be applicable or the amended Act. On the other hand, the decisions in Parmar Construction Co. 4 is directly on the point, namely, the application under Section 11(6) of the Act. 24. In Parmar Construction Co. 4, it is specifically observed and held that in a case where notice invoking arbitration is issued prior to the 2015 Amendment Act and the application under Section 11 ( 6) is filed post amendment, as per Section 21 of the principal Act, the date of issuance of the notice invoking arbitration shall be considered as commencement of the arbitration proceedings and therefore as per Section 26 of the 2015 Amendment Act, the Amended Act, 2015 shall not be applicable and the parties shall be governed by the pre- Amendment Act, 2015. 25. The submission on behalf of the appellant, as above, cannot be accepted for the simple reason that this Court in BCCfl was considering the Court proceedings under Sections 34 and 36. To that, this Court interpreted Section 26 in paras 37 to 39, reproduced hereinabove, and held that the Amendment Act is prospective in nature, and will apply to those arbitral proceedings that are commenced as understood by Section 21 of the principal Act, on or after the 2015 Amendment Act and to Court proceedings which have commenced on or after the 2015 Amendment Act came into force. Therefore, any observations made by this Court in paras 37 to 39 in BCCfl shall be understood and construed with respect to Court proceedings which have commenced on or after the Amendment Act coming into force, namely, the proceedings under Sections 34 and 36. Therefore, the decisions of this Court in Parmar Construction Co. 4 and Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. 5 cannot be said to be per incuriam and/or in conflict with the decision of this Court in BCCfl. 26. As observed hereinabove, in Parmar Construction Co. 4 which is directly on the point, it is specifically observed and held that the 2015 Amendment Act, which came into force w.e. f. 23-10-2015 shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings which are commenced in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act, 1996 before the coming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act, unless parties otherwise agree (para 27).

Singla Constructions7 to the facts of the case on hand as in the present case the notice invoking arbitration clause was issued on 26-12-2013 i.e. much prior to the 2015 Amendment Act and the application under Section 11(6) of the Act has been preferred/filed on 27-4-2016 i.e. much after the Amendment Act came into force, the law prevailing prior to the 2015 Amendment Act shall be applicable and therefore the High Court has rightly entered into the question of accord and satisfaction and has rightly dismissed the application under Section 11(6) of the Act applying the principal Act, namely, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 prevailing prior to the 2015 Amendment Act. We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court. It is observed and held that in a case where the notice invoking arbitration is issued prior to the 2015 Amendment Act and the application under Section 11 for appointment of an arbitrator is made post Amendment Act, 2015, the provisions of pre-Amendment Act, 2015 shall be applicable and not the 2015 Amendment Act. 28.
