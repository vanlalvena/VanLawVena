State of Kamataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481 the Union of India, various State Governments and educational institutions understood the majority judgment in different perspectives. Different statutes/regulations were enacted/framed by different State Governments. The respective State Governments enforced the said statutes in respect of self-financing private institutions, minorities or otherwise. They further issued various government orders in exercise of their powers under Article 162 of the Constitution of India after the judgment in T.M.A. Pai Foundation Case. The University Grants Commission, AICTE and the Medical Council of India, issued provisional/ad hoe guidelines covering the same subject purported to be in terms of the provisions of the principal statutes governing the field in the light of the judgment of this Court in T.M.A. Pai Foundation Case. These led to litigations in several courts. Interim orders passed therein were assailed before the Supreme Court. When these matters came up before a Bench of the Supreme Court, the parties to the writ petitions and special leave petitions attempted to interpret the majority decision in their own way as suited them and therefore at their request all these matters were placed before a Bench of five Judges. Under these circumstances the present Constitution Bench of five Judges was constituted so that doubts/anomalies, if any, could be clarified. The petitioners/applicants who were mostly unaided professional educational institutions (both minority and non-minority) submitted that fixation of percentage of seats that could be filled in the unaided professional colleges, both minority and non-minority by the management, as done by various State Governments, was impermissible. It was further submitted that the private unaided professional educational institutions had been given complete autonomy not only as regards the admission of students but also as regards the determination of their own fee structure. It was submitted that these institutions could fix their own fee structure, which could include a reasonable revenue surplus for purposes of development of education and expansion of the institution, and that so long as there was no profiteering or charging of capitation fees, there could be no interference by the Government. It was submitted that the right to admit students is an essential facet of the right to administer, and so long as admission to the unaided educational institutions is on a fair and transparent basis and on the basis of merit, the Government cannot interfere. It was submitted that these institutions are entitled to fill up all their seats by t Under Article 32 of the Constitution oflndia ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It was submitted that in any event the institutions should be given a choice and be allowed to admit students on the a basis of ICSC or SSC or other such examinations. It was also suggested that educational institutions of a particular type may be permitted to associate themselves for the purposes of holding a common entrance test in each State. On behalf of minority institutions, it was submitted that they are entitled to fill up all the seats with students of their own community/language. On behalf of non- minority institutions, it was submitted that they also had a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions and that the majority judgment b puts them on a par with the minority institutes. As against this, on behalf of the Union of India, various State Governments and some students, who sought to intervene, it was submitted that the right to set up and administer an educational institution is not an absolute right, and this right is subject to reasonable restrictions and that this right is subject (even in respect of minority institutions) to the national interest. It was submitted that imparting education was a State function but, due to resource crunch, the States c were not in a position to establish sufficient number of educational institutions. It was submitted that, because of such resource crunches, the States were permitting private educational institutions to perform State functions. It was submitted that the Union of India, the States and Universities had statutory rights to fix the fees and to regulate the admission of students in order to ensure (a) that there was no profiteering; (b) capitation fee was not charged; (c) admissions were based on principles of merit; and (d) to ensure that persons from the d backward classes and poorer sections of society also had an opportunity to receive education, particularly, professional education. It was submitted that if these educational institutions were permitted to have their own tests for admission, students would be put to undue harassment and hardship inasmuch as they would have to pay for application forms in various colleges and appear for tests in various colleges. It was pointed out that even if each institution charged Rs 500 to Rs 1000, a student would ultimately have to pay a large amount by e way of application fees as, in the absence of a common entrance test and admission procedure the students would have to apply to a number of colleges. It was submitted that the students would also have to spend for transport from and to each college and may find it difficult, if not impossible to travel, from one college to another, to appear in all the tests. It was submitted that unless it was ensured that colleges admit students strictly on the basis of merit at a common f entrance test, it would be impossible to ensure that capitation fees were not charged and that there was no profiteering. It was pointed out that some colleges do not even issue admission forms unless and until the student agrees to pay a hefty sum. It was submitted that the majority judgment clarified that Article 30 had been enacted not for the purposes of giving any special right or privileges to the minority educational institutions, but to ensure that the minorities had equal rights with the majority. It was submitted that minority educational institutions g cannot claim any higher or better rights than those enjoyed by the non-minority educational institutions. On the basis of the rival submissions the following questions arose for consideration of the present Bench (para 6: see also para 52): (J) whether educational institutions are entitled to fix their own fee structure; (2) whether minority and non-minority educational institutions stand on h the same footing and have the same rights; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Though both sides relied upon various passages from the majority judgment in T.M.A. Pai Foundation case in support of the respective submissions, the Court was disposed to look into other parts of the judgment other than those portions which were relied upon and the answers to the questions posted therein. In the special leave petitions and the writ petitions several other questions had also been raised including the constitutionality of statutes prohibiting collection of capitation fee and regulating admission in professional colleges, but the present Bench confined itself to the interpretation of the judgment of the Supreme Court in T.M.A. Pai Foundation case leaving other questions open for consideration by appropriate Benches. In these matters the Supreme Court was not at all concerned with the rights of aided minority and non-minority institutions and restrictions imposed by the States upon them but was concerned only with the rights and obligations of private unaided institutions run by the minorities and non-minorities. Scheme of the headnote: The headnote has been designed on the basis of the formulation of the four questions noted above, except that Questions (3) and (4) are dealt with together. All other issues have been placed at the end under 'Miscellaneous Issues'. I. Constitution of India -Arts. 19(l)(g) & (6), 26 and 30(1) - Right to set up and administer an educational institution - Autonomy of private unaided, minority and non-minority, professional educational institutions in the matter of fixing their own fee structure - Criteria and considerations to be followed keeping in view the nature of the activity - T.M.A. Pai Foundation case, (2002) 8 SCC 481, interpreted - Determination of validity of statutes/regulations governing the fixation of fees, held, to be decided by a Committee, to be set up in each State to review and fix the fee structure - Mode of constituting such committee and presentation of financial details by the educational institution pointed out - Capitation fee, held, cannot be charged directly or indirectly - Extent to which profit can be generated and its utilisation, pointed out - \"Capitation fee\" and \"profiteering\", meaning of - Regulations to be framed to prevent charging of capitation fees or profiteering with provisions for imposing penalty or de-recognition de-affiliation - Also, fee for the entire course i.e. for all the years, held, cannot be charged up front - Prescribed fee for only one semester/year can be charged -Against anticipated loss due to midstream dropping out bond/ bank guarantee can be taken - Fee already collected by institutions beyond one year/semester to be deposited in nationalised banks and withdrawals to be made only when fees become due - Interest accruing thereon to be paid at the end of the course to the student concerned Per Khare, C.J. (for himself and for Variava, Balakrishnan and Pasayat, JJ.) So far as the first question, namely, whether educational institutions are entitled to fix their own fee structure is concerned, the majority judgment in T.M.A. Pai Foundation case is very clear.

They a must also be able to generate surplus which must be used for the betterment and growth of that educational institution. In paragraph 56 of that judgment it has been categorically laid down that the decision on the fees to be charged must necessarily be left to the private educational institutions that do not seek and which are not dependent upon any funds from the Government. Each institute will be entitled to have its own fee structure. The fee structure for each institute must be fixed keeping in mind the infrastructure and facilities available, the b investments made, salaries paid to the teachers and staff, future plans for expansion and/or betterment of the institution etc. Of course there can be no profiteering and capitation fees cannot be charged. It thus needs to be emphasized that as per the majority judgment in T.M.A. Pai case imparting of education is essentially charitable in nature. Thus the surplus/profit that can be generated must be only for the benefit/use of that educational institution. c Profits/surplus cannot be diverted for any other use or purpose and cannot be used for personal gain or for any other business or enterprise. (Paras 6 and 7) T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481, explained and relied on With regard to statutes/regulations governing the fixation of fees, the validity of which have not yet been considered by the Supreme Court, it is directed that in order to give effect to the judgment in T.M.A. Pai Foundation case the respective State Governments/authority concerned shall set up, in each d State, a committee headed by a retired High Court Judge who shall be nominated by the Chief Justice of that State. The other member, who shall be nominated by the Judge, should be a Chartered Accountant of repute. A representative of the Medical Council of India (in short \"MCI\") or the All India Council for Technical Education (in short \"AICTE\"), depending on the type of institution, shall also be a member. The Secretary of the State Government in charge of Medical Education or Technical Education, as the case may be, shall be a member and e Secretary of the Committee. The Committee should be free to nominate/co-opt another independent person of repute, so that the total number of members of the Committee shall not exceed five. Each educational institute must place before this Committee, well in advance of the academic year, its proposed fee structure. Along with the proposed fee structure all relevant documents and books of accounts must also be produced before the Committee for their scrutiny. The f Committee shall then decide whether the fees proposed by that institute are justified and are not profiteering or charging capitation fee. The Committee will be at liberty to approve the fee structure or to propose some other fee which can be charged by the institute. The fee fixed by the Committee shall be binding for a period of three years, at the end of which period the institute would be at liberty to apply for revision. Once fees are fixed by the Committee, the institute cannot charge either directly or indirectly any other amount over and above the g amount fixed as fees. If any other amount is charged, under any other head or guise e.g. donations, the same would amount to charging of capitation fee. The Governments/appropriate authorities should consider framing appropriate regulations, if not already framed, whereunder if it is found that an institution is charging capitation fees or profiteering that institution can be appropriately penalised and also face the prospect of losing its recognition/affiliation.

The infrastructural needs and provision for allowances and remuneration of the Chairman and other members of the Committee shall also be borne by the respective State Government. (Para 20) It has been noticed that some educational institutions are collecting, in advance, the fees for the entire course i.e. for all the years because the institute was not sure whether the student would leave the institute midstream and due to seat lying vacant the institute would suffer. This is not proper. An educational institution can only charge prescribed fees for one semester/year. If an institution feels that any particular student may leave in midstream then, at the highest, it may require that student to give a bond/bank guarantee that the balance fees for the whole course would be received by the institute even if the student left in midstream. If any educational institution has collected fees in advance, only the fees of that semester/year can be used by the institution. The balance fees must be kept invested in fixed deposits in a nationalised bank. As and when fees fall due for a semester/year only the fees falling due for that semester/year can be withdrawn by the institution. The rest must continue to remain deposited till such time that they fall due. At the end of the course the interest earned on these deposits must be paid to the student from whom the fees were collected in advance. (Para 8) Per Sinha, J. On a bare reading of the relevant paragraphs of the T.M.A. Pai Foundation judgment it is beyond any doubt that in the matter of determination of the fee structure the unaided institutions exercise a greater autonomy. They, like any other citizen carrying on an occupation, must be held to be entitled to a reasonable surplus for development of education and expansion of the institution. Reasonable surplus doctrine can be given effect to only if the institutions make profits out of their investments. As stated in paragraph 56 of T.M.A. Pai judgment, economic forces have a role to play. They, thus, indisputably have to plan their investment and expenditure in such a manner that they may generate some amount of profit. What is forbidden is: (a) capitation fee, and ( b) profiteering. The expression \"capitation fee\" does not have any fixed meaning, though defined in some State statutes. Profiteering has been defined in Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edn. as: \"Taking advantage of unusual or exceptional circumstances to make excessive profits;\". (Paras 147, 149 and 158) While this Court has not laid down any fixed guidelines as regards fee structure, in my opinion, reasonable surplus should ordinarily vary from 6% to 15%, as such surplus would be utilized for expansion of the system and development of education. (Para 156) The fee structure in relation to each and every college must be determined separately keeping in view several factors, including facilities available, infrastructure made available, the age of the institution, investment made, future plan for expansion and betterment of the educational standard etc. The case of each institution in this behalf is required to be considered by an appropriate Committee. For the said purpose, even the books of accounts maintained by the institution may have to be looked into. Whatever is determined by the Committee by way of a fee structure having regard to relevant factors, some of which are enumerated hereinbefore, the management of the institution would not be entitled to charge anything more.

(2003) 6 sec While determining the fee structure, safeguard has to be provided for so that a professional institutions do not become auction houses for the purpose of selling seats. Having regard to the statement of law laid down in paragraph 56 of T.M.A. Pai judgment, it would have been better, if sufficient guidelines could have been provided for. Such a task, which is a difficult one, has to be left to the Committee. While fixing the fee structure the Committee shall also take into consideration, inter alia, the salary or remuneration paid to the members of the b faculty and other staff, the investment made by them, the infrastructure provided and plan for future development of the institution as also expansion of the educational institution. Future planning or improvement of facilities may be provided for. An institution may want to invest in an expensive device (for medical colleges) or a powerful computer (for technical college). These factors are also required to be taken care of. The State must evolve a detailed procedure for constitution and smooth functioning of the Committee. (Para 155) c The institutions shall charge fee only for one year in accordance with the rules and shall not charge the fees for the entire course. (Para 157) With a view to ensure that an educational institution is kept within its bounds and does not indulge in profiteering or otherwise exploiting its students financially, it will be open to the statutory authorities and in their absence the State to constitute an appropriate body, till appropriate statutory regulations are d made in that behalf. (Para 159) The respective institutions, however, for the aforementioned purpose must file an appropriate application before the Committee and place before it all documents and books of accounts in support of its case. (Para 160) Fees once fixed should not ordinarily be changed for a period of three years, unless there exists an extraordinary reason. The proposed fees, before indication e in the prospectus issued for admission, have to be approved by the concerned authority/body set up. For this purpose the application should not be filed later than April of the preceding year of the relevant education session. The authority/ body shall take the decision as regards fees chargeable latest by October of the year concerned, so that it can form part of the prospectus. No institution should charge any fee beyond the amount fixed and the fee charged shall be deposited in a nationalized bank. In other words, no employee or any other person employed f by the management shall be entitled to take fees in cash from the students concerned directly. The statutory authority may consider the desirability of framing an appropriate regulation inter alia to the effect that in the event it is found that the management of a private unaided professional institution has accepted any amount other than the fees prescribed by the Committee, it may have to pay a penalty ten to fifteen times of the amount so collected and in a suitable case it may also lose its recognition or affiliation. (Para 161) g However, there cannot be any doubt that before any such order is passed, the institutions concerned shall be entitled to an opportunity of being heard. For the aforementioned purpose, the State shall set up a machinery to detect cases where amounts in excess of the permitted limit are collected as it is the general experience that students pay a huge amount.

(contra) That minority institutions can admit own students is a protection to get benefit of the equality clause and not a right - Affirmative action or protection though constitutionally sanctioned cannot ignore constitutional morality which embraces in itself the doctrine of equality - Minority institutions are as much subject to regulatory measures as non-minority institutions are - Hence, rights of minorities and non-minorities in this regard are equal (Per curiam) But both types of institutions can be asked to close down in national interest - Per Sinha, J.

(for himself and for Variava, Balakrishnan and Pasayat, JJ.) At first blush it appears that paras 138 and 139 of T.M.A. Pai case equate both minority and non-minority educational institutions. But a careful perusal reveals that the essence of what has been laid down is that the minority educational institutions have a guarantee or assurance to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. These paragraphs merely provide that laws, rules and regulations cannot be such that they favour majority institutions over minority institutions. These paragraphs do not mean that non-minority educational institutions would have the same rights as those conferred on minority educational institutions by Article 30. Non-minority educational institutions do not have the protection of Article 30. Thus, in certain matters they cannot and do not stand on a similar footing as minority educational institutions.

Just to take a few examples, the Government may decide to nationalise education. In that case it may be enacted that private educational institutions will not be permitted. Non-minority educational institutions may become bound by such an enactment. However, the right given under Article 30 to minorities cannot be done away with and the minorities will still have a fundamental right to establish and administer b educational institutions of their choice. Similarly, even though the Government may have a right to take over management of a non-minority educational institution, the management of a minority educational institution cannot be taken over because of the protection given under Article 30. Of course, we must not be understood to mean that even in the national interest a minority institute cannot be closed down. Further, minority educational institutions have preferential right to admit students of their own community/language. No such rights exist so far c as non-minority educational institutions are concerned. (Para 9) T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481, explained Per Sinha, J. ( dissenting) The statement of law contained in paragraphs 138 and 139 of T.M.A. Pai case is absolutely clear and unambiguous and no exception can be taken thereto. The doubt, if any, that the minorities have a higher right in terms of Article 30(1) d of the Constitution of India may be dispelled in clearest terms inasmuch as the right of the minorities and non-minorities is equal. Only certain additional protection has been conferred under Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India to bring the minorities on the same platform as that of non-minorities as regards the right to establish and administer an educational institution for the purpose of imparting education to the members of their own community whether based on religion or language. (Para 105) e A citizen of India whether belonging to a minority community or not with a view to establish an unaided professional institution exercises his right of occupation under Article 19(l)(g). To the said extent, admittedly, the right of the minority and non-minority is equal. Article 30, however, seeks further to protect the minorities so that they may establish and administer institutions of their choice with the right to admit students of their choice in terms of paragraph 68 f of the judgment in T.M.A. Pai. But they do not have any right of admitting students belonging to a particular locality or speaking a particular language as such institutions are not meant to serve the said purpose. But the same for all intent and purport, having regard to the question involved in the matter, may not be of much consequence. (Paras 92, 89 and 93) T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

Although the width and scope of Article 19(l)(g) and Article 30 are different, but they seek to fulfil the same purpose.

(dissenting) (contd.) behalf must satisfy the requirement of Article 30. The doctrine of equality shall further apply once the institutions have been established. (Para 96) The right of the minority institutions to admit their own students, in other words, is only by way of protection of the minorities' interest so that they may get the benefit of the equality clause. Such a protection should not be confused to be a right. This is evident not only from paragraphs 138 and 139 of the _iudgment but also from para 371 (opinion of Ruma Pal, J.). (Para 104) Also, even the right of the minorities in the matter of admission of students can also be restricted like the non-minorities. T.M.A. Pai says so. (Para 109) T.M.A. Pai case cannot be read to have held that the minority institutions can admit all the students belonging to their own community whereas the non- minority institutions cannot, the same, in my opinion, would amount to rewriting the judgment. (Paras 112 and 113) Unni Krishnan, J.P. v. State of A.P., (1993) 1 SCC 645, referred to T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481, explained and relied on It has been held by the Supreme Court in no unmistakable terms that the State cannot take any step by way of imposing conditions at the time of grant of recognition which would amount to nationalization of education. This applies to both minorities and non-minorities. (Para 99) Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v. State of Gujarat, (1974) 1 SCC 717 : (1975) 1 SCR 173; T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Kamataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481 , relied on Yet, it will not be a correct proposition of law, on the face of clause (1-A) of Article 30 of the Constitution to contend that the properties of the minority institutions cannot be taken over at all. The only right which they have is to get reasonable compensation so as to enable them to establish another educational institution at some other place. It is not necessary to raise a hypothetical question to drive home a point which is of not much consequence. As and when laws are made, their constitutionality will have to be tested on their own merit. Pre-emptive answers should not be given on hypothetical questions. Furthermore, in the event running of a minority institution is found to be against the national interest or permissible limits of regulations, it can be taken over with a view to maintain morality, public order, health, national interest. Similar such considerations would empower the State to close the institution or take over the management thereof, although the same may be done only in extreme cases. In case of gross mismanagement and violation of the conditions of essentiality certificate also, the State may be held to have the power to close down the institution. (Paras 101 to 103) The professional institutions indisputably are governed by statutes like the MCI Act, the AICTE Act and the UGC Act. In terms of the provisions of the statutes and the regulations framed thereunder, the private professional institutions are required to maintain certain standards. They cannot be deviated or departed from. In the context of giving admissions to meritorious students, it cannot be said that students belonging to the minority community shall be admitted without reference to merit. Courts would not encourage establishment of pseudo-minority institutions imparting professional courses. The statutory rules and regulations, thus, must be equally applied to all the professional institutions whether aided or unaided, whether run by a minority or non- minority. In the matter of maintenance of standard, these institutions must be equally treated.

(2003) 6 sec Now, every Indian may be a minority, either based on religion or language, a in one part of the country or the other. The right of a citizen as a minority in one part of the country cannot be higher than his right as a member of majority in another part of the country. (Paras 107 and 106) Also, the concept of equality is not a doctrinaire approach. It is a binding thread which runs through the entire constitutional text. An affirmative action may, therefore, be constitutionally valid by reason of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) and various directive principles of State policy, but the Court cannot ignore the b constitutional morality which embraces in itself the doctrine of equality. It would be constitutionally immoral to perpetuate inequality among majority people of the country in the guise of protecting the constitutional rights of minorities and constitutional rights of the backward and downtrodden. All the rights of these groups are part of the right to social development which cannot render national interest and public interest subservient to right of an individual or right of a c community. If a measure tends to perpetuate inequality and makes the goal of equality a mirage, such measure should not receive the approval of the Court. The Court, in such circumstances, has to mould the relief by indicating what would be the reasonable measure or action which furthers the object of achieving equality.

(for himself and for Variava, Balakrishnan and Pasayat, JJ.) The relevant paras relating to private unaided professional colleges in T.M.A. Pai case are paras 68, 58, 59. Paragraph 68 of the majority judgment in T.M.A. Pai case can be split into seven parts: Firstly, it deals with both the unaided minority, as well as non-minority professional colleges. Secondly, it will be unfair to apply the rules and regulations framed by the State Government as regards the government-aided professional colleges to the unaided professional colleges. Thirdly, the unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration; while at the same time they should not forego or discard the principles of merit. Fourthly, it is permissible for the University or the Government at the time of granting recognition to require an unaided institution to provide for merit-based admission while at the same time giving the management sufficient discretion in admitting students. Fifthly, for unaided non-minority professional colleges certain percentage of seats can be reserved for admission by the management out of those students who have passed the common test held by itself or by the State/University and for applying to the college/University for admission, while the rest of the seats may be filled up on the basis of counselling by the State agency. Sixthly, the provisions for poorer and backward sections of the society in unaided professional colleges are also to be provided for. Seventhly, the prescription for percentage of seats in unaided professional colleges has to be done by the Government according to the local needs. A different percentage of seats for admission can be fixed for minority unaided and non-minority unaided professional colleges. (Para 12) T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka , (2002) 8 SCC 481, explained The Pai majority judgment in making a distinction between private unaided professional colleges and other educational institutions i.e. schools and undergraduate colleges recognises that it is in national interest to have good and efficient professionals. The judgment provides that national interest would prevail, even over minority rights. It is for this reason that in professional colleges, both minority and non-minority, merit has been made the criterion for admission.

Per Khare, C.J. (for himself and for Variava, Balakrishnan and Pasayat, JJ.) (contd.) professional colleges admission of students, other than the percentage given to the management, can only be on the basis of merit as per the common entrance tests conducted by government agencies. (Para 13) a However, a proper reading of paragraph 68 of that judgment, indicates that a further distinction has been made between minority and non-minority professional colleges. It is provided that in cases of non-minority professional b colleges \"a certain percentage of seats\" can be reserved for admission by the management. The rest have to be filled up on the basis of counselling by State agencies. The prescription of percentage has to be done by the Government according to local needs. Keeping this in mind provisions have to be made for the poorer and backward sections of the society. This aspect of local needs comes into consideration while issuing essentiality certificate before setting up of a medical college. (Para 13) c T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481, explained and relied on State of Maharashtra v. Indian Medical Assn., (2002) 1 SCC 589, relied on It may be noted that the same yardstick cannot be applied to both minority and non-minority professional colleges in fixing the percentage of seats and so para 68 provides that a different percentage can be prescribed for unaided minority institutions. The expression \"different percentage for minority professional institutions\" carries a different meaning than the expression \"certain d percentage for unaided professional colleges\". In fixing the percentage for unaided minority professional colleges the State must keep in mind, apart from local needs, the interest/need of that community in the State. The need of that community, in the State, would be paramount vis-a-vis the local needs. (Paras 13 & 14) Kerala Education Bill, 1957, Re, AIR 1958 SC 956 : 1959 SCR 995; Sidhajbhai Sabhai v. e State of Gujarat, (1963) 3 SCR 837: AIR 1963 SC 540; Rev. Father W. Proost v.

State of Gujarat, (1974) 1 SCC 717 : (1975) 1 SCR 173, referred to It must be clarified that minority professional colleges can admit, in their management quota, a student of their own community/language in preference to a student of another community even though that other student is more f meritorious. However, whilst selecting/admitting students of their community/ language the inter se merit among those very students of that community/ language cannot be ignored. But, if the seats cannot be filled up from members of their community/language, then the other students can be admitted only on the basis of merit based on a common entrance test conducted by government agencies. (Para 15) The question then is how the management of both minority and non- 9 minority professional colleges can admit students in the quota allotted to them. To avoid or control profiteering and/or charging of capitation fees, the majority judgment provides that in professional colleges admission must be on the basis of merit. But students would have to and do undergo great hardship and incur huge cost in appearing for individual tests of various colleges. So what is necessary is a practical approach keeping in mind the need for a merit-based h selection. The words \"common entrance test\" used in para 68 of T.M.A. Pai case clearly indicate that each institute cannot hold a separate test.

(for himself and for Variava, Balakrishnan and Pasayat, JJ.) (contd.) It is, therefore, held that the management could select students, of their quota, either on the basis of the common entrance test conducted by the State or on the basis of a common entrance test to be conducted by an association of all colleges of a particular type in that State e.g. medical, engineering or technical etc. The common entrance test, held by the association, must be for admission to all colleges of that type in the State. The option of choosing, between either of these tests, must be exercised before issuing of prospectus and after intimation to the authority concerned and the Committee set up hereinafter. If any professional college chooses not to admit from the common entrance test conducted by the association then that college must necessarily admit from the common entrance test conducted by the State. After holding the common entrance test and declaration of results the merit list will immediately be placed on the notice- board of all colleges which have chosen to admit as per this test. A copy of the merit list will also be forthwith sent to the authority concerned and the Committee. Selection of students must then be strictly on the basis of merit as per that merit list. Of course, minority colleges will be entitled to fill up their quota with their own students on the basis of inter se merit amongst those students. The list of students admitted, along with the rank number obtained by the student, the fees collected and all such particulars and details as may be required by the concerned authority or the Committee must be submitted to them forthwith. The question paper and the answer papers must be preserved for such period as the concerned authority or Committee may indicate. If it is found that any student has been admitted dehors merit, penalty can be imposed on that institute and in appropriate cases recognition/affiliation may also be withdrawn. (Para 16) Certain minority institutions, such as, Christian Medical College, Vellore, St. John's Hospital, Islamic Academy of Education have asserted that they stand on a different footing from other minority non-aided professional institutions and have been since long following their own admission procedure with fairness and transparency. Their claim though disputed need not be gone into. It is left open to the institutions which have been established and who have had their own admission procedure for, at least, the last 25 years to apply to the Committee to be set up for such matters.

Common entrance test and percentage of seats [Ed.: On these aspects there is detailed discussion by Sinha, J. in paragraphs 164 to 195 involving interpretation of T.M.A. Pai case; and its effect on dictum of St. Stephen's case. The said discussion is interspersed with the several directions addressed to the institutions and State Governments. As almost the entire discussion in the said paragraphs 164 to 195 appears relevant the reader is advised to read these paragraphs in the judgment itself.] St. Stephen's College v. University of Delhi, (1992) 1 sec 558, considered Merit Technical profession in general and medical profession in particular in all countries and in all ages has been considered to be a noble profession. To acquire excellence, these professions demand a very high calibre, which criterion can be satisfied only by the meritorious students. If we want to achieve a very high standard which would be comparable to the standard of the developed countries, then merit and merit alone should be the basis of selection for the candidates. (Para 196) Secondly, not only to maintain high standard of education, but also to maintain uniformity of standard, the right of selection of candidates for any professional course cannot be left to the discretion of any individual management. Efforts must be made to find out one single standard for all the institutions. (Para 197) Thirdly, to ensure high standard of education and for that purpose to ensure admission to the most eligible candidates, requiring merit in a poor country like ours, the tuition and other fees should be within the reach of common people. (Para 198) So far as minority institutions are concerned, the merit criterion would have to be judged like a pyramid. At the kindergarten, primary, secondary levels, minorities may have 100% quota. At this level the merit may not have much relevance at all but at the level of higher education and in particular, professional education and postgraduate-level education, merit indisputably should be a relevant criterion. At the postgraduation level, where there may be a few seats, the minority institutions may not have much say in the matter. Services of doctors, engineers and other professionals coming out from the institutions of professional excellence must be made available to the entire country and not to any particular class or group of people. All citizens including the minorities have also a fundamental duty in this behalf. (Para 199) Pradeep Jain (Dr) v. Union of India, (1984) 3 sec 654, relied on [Ed.: For imparting professional education the aspect of merit has been declared as the most important criterion in selection and conduct of common entrance tests. This aspect is also linked to the percentage of seats. So the reader is advised to also read paragraphs 164 to 195 in the judgment itself.

Recognition/affiliation Although the minorities have a right to establish institutions of their own choice, they admittedly, do not have any right of recognition or affiliation for the said purpose. They must fulfil the requirements of law as also other conditions which may reasonably be fixed by the appropriate Government or the University. a (Para 219) b As laid down in T.M.A. Pai case certain conditions can be imposed as regards admission of students and mode of holding examinations at the time of grant of recognition. But that does not mean that once recognition has been granted, no further restriction can be imposed. Often recognition was granted long long time back. Hence it would be too much to say that only because an institution receives recognition/affiliation at a distant point of time the c appropriate Government is denuded of its power to lay down any law in imposing any fresh condition despite the need of change owing to passage of time. Furthermore, Parliament or the State Legislatures are not denuded of their power having regard to restrictions that may satisfy the test of clause (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution of India or regulations in terms of Article 30 depending upon the national interest/public interest and other relevant factors. But it may be emphasized that the State/University while granting recognition or d the affiliation cannot impose any condition in furtherance of its own needs or in pursuit of the directive principles of State policy.

The right under clause (1) of Article 30 is not absolute, and subject to reasonable regulations which inter alia may be framed having regard to the public interest and national interest of the country.

From the various decision of the Supreme Court it is evident that though the right engrafted under Article 30(1) of the Constitution does not lay down any a limitations or restrictions upon the right of a minority to administer its educational institutions, yet the right cannot be used absolutely and unreasonably. Article 30(1) of the Constitution does not confer an absolute right. The exercise of such right is subject to permissible State regulations with an eye on preventing maladministration. The regulatory measures are necessary for ensuring orderly, efficient and sound administration. The regulatory measures can be laid down by the State in the administration of minority institutions. The b right to administer does not amount to the right to maladminister and the right is not free from regulation. (Paras 46, 122 and 121) Having regard to public interest all institutions imparting professional education are bound to maintain excellence in standard of education. Hence State can impose restrictions and make regulations both in terms of Article 19(l)(g) and Article 30. (Para 120) c Broadly stated, there are \"permissible regulations\" and \"impermissible regulations\".

If a measure tends to f perpetuate inequality and makes the goal of equality a mirage, such measure should not receive the approval of the Court. The Court, in such circumstances, has to mould the relief by indicating what would be the reasonable measure or action which furthers the object of achieving equality. (Para 118) The concept of equality is not a doctrinaire approach. It is a binding thread which runs through the entire constitutional text. An affirmative action may, therefore, be constitutionally valid by reason of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) and g various directive principles of State policy, but the Court cannot ignore the constitutional morality which embraces in itself the doctrine of equality. It would be constitutionally immoral to perpetuate inequality among majority people of the country in the guise of protecting the constitutional rights of minorities and constitutional rights of the backward and downtrodden. All the rights of these groups are part of the right to social development which cannot render national interest and public interest subservient to right of an individual or right of a h community.

State of Karnataka 1• A brief history as to how an eleven-Judge Bench of this Court came to decide this case is set out in paragraph 3 of the judgment, which reads as under: (SCC p. 529) \"3. The hearing of these cases has had a chequered history. Writ Petition No. 350 of 1993 filed by the Islamic Academy of Education and b connected petitions were placed before a Bench of five Judges. As the Bench was prima facie of the opinion that Article 30 did not clothe a minority educational institution with the power to adopt its own method of selection and the correctness of the decision of this Court in St. Stephen's College v. University of Delhi2 was doubted, it was directed that the questions that arose should be authoritatively answered by a c larger Bench. These cases were then placed before a Bench of seven Judges. The questions framed were recast and on 6-2-1997, the Court directed that the matter be placed before a Bench of at least eleven Judges, as it was felt that in view of the Forty-second Amendment to the Constitution, whereby 'education' had been included in Entry 25 of List III of Seventh Schedule, the question of who would be regarded as a d 'minority' was required to be considered because the earlier case-law related to the pre-amendment era, when education was only in the State List. ... \" After the judgment was delivered on 31-10-2002, the Union of India, various State Governments and the educational institutions understood the majority judgment in different perspectives. Different statutes/regulations were e enacted/framed by different State Governments. These led to litigations in several courts. Interim orders passed therein have been assailed before this Court. When these matters came up before a Bench of this Court, the parties to the writ petitions and special leave petitions attempted to interpret the majority decision in their own way as suited to them and therefore at their request all these matters were placed before a Bench of five Judges. It is f under these circumstances that this Bench has been constituted so that doubts/anomalies, if any, could be clarified. 2. Most of the petitioners/applicants before us are unaided professional educational institutions (both minority and non-minority). On behalf of the petitioners/applicants it was submitted that the answers given to the questions, as set out at the end of the majority judgment, lay down the true g ratio of the judgment. It was submitted that any observation made in the body of the judgment had to be read in the context of the answers given. We are unable to accept this submission.

The ratio decidendi of a judgment has to be found out only on reading the entire judgment. In fact, the ratio of the judgment is what is set out in the judgment itself. The answer to the question would necessarily have to be read in the context of what is set out in the judgment and not in isolation. In case of any doubt as regards any observations, reasons and principles, the other part of the judgment has to be looked into. By reading a line here and there from the judgment, one cannot find out the entire ratio decidendi of the judgment. We, therefore, while giving our clarifications, are disposed to look into other parts of the judgment other than those portions which may be relied upon. 3. Very briefly stated, the other submissions were as follows: On behalf of the petitioners/applicants it was also submitted that fixation of percentage of seats that could be filled in the unaided professional colleges, both minority and non-minority by the management, as done by various State Governments, was impermissible. It is further submitted that the private unaided professional educational institutions had been given complete autonomy not only as regards the admission of students but also as regards the determination of their own fee structure. It was submitted that these institutions could fix their own fee structure, which could include a reasonable revenue surplus for purposes of development of education and expansion of the institution, and that so long as there was no profiteering or charging of capitation fees, there could be no interference by the Government. It was submitted that the right to admit students is an essential facet of the right to administer, and so long as admission to the unaided educational institutions is on a fair and transparent basis and on the basis of merit, the Government cannot interfere. It was submitted that these institutions are entitled to fill up all their seats by adopting/evolving a rational and transparent method of admission which ensures that merit is adequately taken care of. It was submitted that in any event the institutions should be given a choice and be allowed to admit students on the basis of ICSC or SSC or other such examinations. It was also suggested that educational institutions of a particular type may be permitted to associate themselves for the purposes of holding a common entrance test in each State.

On behalf of non-minority institutions, it was submitted that they also had a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions and that the majority judgment puts them on a par with the minority institutes. 4. As against this, on behalf of the Union of India, various State Governments and some students, who sought to intervene, it was submitted that the right to set up and administer an educational institution was not an absolute right, and this right is subject to reasonable restrictions and that this right is subject (even in respect of minority institutions) to national interest.

It was submitted that if these educational institutions were permitted to have their own tests for admission, the students would be put to undue harassment and hardship inasmuch as they would have to pay b for application forms in various colleges and appear for tests in various colleges. It was pointed out that even if each institution charged Rs 500 to Rs 1000, a student would ultimately have to pay a large amount by way of application fees as, in the absence of a common entrance test and admission procedure the students would have to apply to a number of colleges. It is submitted that the students would also have to spend for transport from and C to each college and may find it difficult, if not impossible to travel, from one college to another, to appear in all the tests. It was submitted that unless it was ensured that colleges admit students strictly on the basis of merit at a common entrance test, it would be impossible to ensure that capitation fees were not charged and that there was no profiteering. It was pointed out that some colleges do not even issue admission forms unless and until the student d agrees to pay a hefty sum. It was submitted that the majority judgment clarified that Article 30 had been enacted not for the purposes of giving any special right or privileges to the minority educational institutions, but to ensure that the minorities had equal rights with the majority. It was submitted that minority educational institutions cannot claim any higher or better rights than those enjoyed by the non-minority educational institutions. S. Both sides relied upon various passages from the majority judgment in e support of the respective submissions. These passages are reproduced hereinafter. 6.

Question 1 7. So far as the first question is concerned, in our view the maJonty judgment is very clear. There can be no fixing of a rigid fee structure by the Government.

In paragraph 56 of the judgment it has been categorically laid down that the decision on the fees to be charged must necessarily be left to the private educational institutions that do not seek and which are not dependent upon any funds from the Government. Each institute will be entitled to have its own fee structure. The fee structure for each institute must be fixed keeping in mind the infrastructure and facilities available, the investments made, salaries paid to the teachers and staff, future plans for expansion and/or betterment of the institution etc. Of course there can be no profiteering and capitation fees cannot be charged. It thus needs to be emphasized that as per the majority judgment imparting of education is essentially charitable in nature. Thus the surplus/profit that can be generated must be only for the benefit/use of that educational institution. Profits/surplus cannot be diverted for any other use or purpose and cannot be used for personal gain or for any other business or enterprise. As, at present, there are statutes/regulations which govern the fixation of fees and as this Court has not yet considered the validity of those statutes/regulations, we direct that in order to give effect to the judgment in T.M.A. Pai case 1 the respective State Governments/concerned authority shall set up, in each State, a committee headed by a retired High Court Judge who shall be nominated by the Chief Justice of that State. The other member, who shall be nominated by the Judge, should be a Chartered Accountant of repute. A representative of the Medical Council of India (in short \"MCI\") or the All India Council for Technical Education (in short \"AICTE\"), depending on the type of institution, shall also be a member. The Secretary of the State Government in charge of Medical Education or Technical Education, as the case may be, shall be a member and Secretary of the Committee. The Committee should be free to nominate/co-opt another independent person of repute, so that the total number of members of the Committee shall not exceed five. Each educational institute must place before this Committee, well in advance of the academic year, its proposed fee structure. Along with the proposed fee structure all relevant documents and books of accounts must also be produced before the Committee for their scrutiny. The Committee shall then decide whether the fees proposed by that institute are justified and are not profiteering or charging capitation fee. The Committee will be at liberty to approve the fee structure or to propose some other fee which can be charged by the institute. The fee fixed by the Committee shall be binding for a period of three years, at the end of which period the institute would be at liberty to apply for revision. Once fees are fixed by the Committee, the institute cannot charge either directly or indirectly any other amount over and above the amount fixed as fees. If any other amount is charged, under any other head or guise e.g. donations, the same would amount to charging of capitation fee. The Governments/appropriate authorities should consider framing appropriate regulations, if not already framed, whereunder if it is found that an institution is charging capitation fees or profiteering that institution can be 1 T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

It must be mentioned that during arguments it was pointed out to us a that some educational institutions are collecting, in advance, the fees for the entire course i.e. for all the years. It was submitted that this was done because the institute was not sure whether the student would leave the institute midstream. It was submitted that if the student left the course in midstream then for the remaining years the seat would lie vacant and the institute would suffer. In our view an educational institution can only charge prescribed fees b for one semester/year. If an institution feels that any particular student may leave in midstream then, at the highest, it may require that student to give a bond/bank guarantee that the balance fees for the whole course would be received by the institute even if the student left in midstream. If any educational institution has collected fees in advance, only the fees of that semester/year can be used by the institution. The balance fees must be kept invested in fixed deposits in a nationalised bank. As and when fees fall due c for a semester/year only the fees falling due for that semester/year can be withdrawn by the institution. The rest must continue to remain deposited till such time that they fall due. At the end of the course the interest earned on these deposits must be paid to the student from whom the fees were collected in advance. Question 2 d 9. The next question for consideration is whether minority and non-minority educational institutions stand on the same footing and have the same rights under the judgment. In support of the contention that the minority and non-minority educational institutions had the same rights reliance was placed upon paragraphs 138 and 139 of the judgment. These read as follows: (SCC pp. 578-79) e \"138. As we look at it, Article 30(1) is a sort of guarantee or assurance to the linguistic and religious minority institutions of their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Secularism and equality being two of the basic features of the Constitution, Article 30(1) ensures protection to the linguistic and religious minorities, thereby preserving the secularism of the country. f Furthermore, the principles of equality must necessarily apply to the enjoyment of such rights. No law can be framed that will discriminate against such minorities with regard to the establishment and administration of educational institutions vis-a-vis other educational institutions. Any law or rule or regulation that would put the educational institutions run by the minorities at a disadvantage when compared to the g institutions run by the others will have to be struck down. At the same time, there also cannot be any reverse discrimination. It was observed in St. Xavier's College case3 , at SCR p. 192, that: (SCC p. 743, para 9) 'The whole object of conferring the right on minorities under Article 30 is to ensure that there will be equality between the 3 Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v.

If the minorities do not have such special protection they will be denied equality.' In other words, the essence of Article 30(1) is to ensure equal treatment between the majority and the minority institutions. No one type or category of institution should be disfavoured or, for that matter receive more favourable treatment than another. Laws of the land, including rules and regulations, must apply equally to the majority institutions as well as to the minority institutions. The minority institutions must be allowed to do what the non-minority institutions are permitted to do. 139. Like any other private unaided institutions, similar unaided educational institutions administered by linguistic or religious minorities are assured maximum autonomy in relation thereto; e.g. method of recruitment of teachers, charging of fees and admission of students. They will have to comply with the conditions of recognition, which cannot be such as to whittle down the right under Article 30.\" (emphasis in original) Undoubtedly, at first blush it does appear that these paragraphs equate both types of educational institutions. However, on a careful reading of these paragraphs it is evident that the essence of what has been laid down is that the minority educational institutions have a guarantee or assurance to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. These paragraphs merely provide that laws, rules and regulations cannot be such that they favour majority institutions over minority institutions. We do not read these paragraphs to mean that non-minority educational institutions would have the same rights as those conferred on minority educational institutions by Article 30 of the Constitution of India. Non-minority educational institutions do not have the protection of Article 30. Thus, in certain matters they cannot and do not stand on a similar footing as minority educational institutions. Even though the principle behind Article 30 is to ensure that the minorities are protected and are given an equal treatment yet the special right given under Article 30 does give them certain advantages. Just to take a few examples, the Government may decide to nationalise education. In that case it may be enacted that private educational institutions will not be permitted. Non-minority educational institutions may become bound by such an enactment. However, the right given under Article 30 to minorities cannot be done away with and the minorities will still have a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Similarly, even though the Government may have a right to take over management of a non-minority educational institution, the management of a minority educational institution cannot be taken over because of the protection given under Article 30. Of course, we must not be understood to mean that even in national interest a minority institute cannot be closed down. Further, minority educational institutions have preferential right to admit students of their own community/language. No such rights exist so far as non-minority educational institutions are concerned. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Thus all observations in answer to Questions 3 and 4 are therefore confined a to such educational institutions. 11. In order to answer the third and fourth questions it is necessary to see the manner in which the majority judgment is framed and to consider certain paragraphs of the judgment. The majority judgment considered various aspects under different heads. The 3rd head is \"In case of private institutions, can there be government regulations and, if so, to what b extent?\". This is further divided into four sub-headings viz. \"Private unaided non-minority educational institutions\"; \"Private unaided professional colleges\"; \"Private aided professional institutions (non- minority)\" and \"Other aided institutions\". The paragraph which has been strongly relied upon is paragraph 68 which is under the sub-heading \"Private unaided professional colleges\". The said paragraph reads as under: (SCC c p. 549) \"68. It would be unfair to apply the same rules and regulations regulating admission to both aided and unaided professional institutions. It must be borne in mind that unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration while, at the same time, they do not forgo or discard the principle of merit. It would, therefore, be d permissible for the University or the Government, at the time of granting recognition, to require a private unaided institution to provide for merit- based selection while, at the same time, giving the management sufficient discretion in admitting students. This can be done through various methods. For instance, a certain percentage of the seats can be reserved for admission by the management out of those students who have passed e the common entrance test held by itself or by the State/University and have applied to the college concerned for admission, while the rest of the seats may be filled up on the basis of counselling by the State agency. This will incidentally take care of poorer and backward sections of the society. The prescription of percentage for this purpose has to be done by the Government according to the local needs and different percentages f can be fixed for minority unaided and non-minority unaided and professional colleges. The same principles may be applied to other non- professional but unaided educational institutions viz. graduation and postgraduation non-professional colleges or institutes.\" Reliance was also placed on paragraphs 58 and 59 which read as follows: g (SCC pp. 545-46) \"58.

Excellence in professional education would require that greater emphasis be laid on the merit of a student seeking admission. Appropriate regulations for this purpose may be made keeping in view the other observations made in this judgment in the context of admissions to unaided institutions. 59. Merit is usually determined, for admission to professional and higher education colleges, by either the marks that the student obtains at the qualifying examination or school-leaving certificate stage followed by the interview, or by a common entrance test conducted by the institution, or in the case of professional colleges, by government agencies.\" Based on the above paragraphs it had been submitted, on behalf of the Union of India, various State Governments and students that the majority judgment makes a clear distinction between professional educational institutions (both minority and non-minority) and other educational institutions i.e. schools and undergraduate colleges. The submission was that in professional institutions merit had to play an important role and that excellence in professional education required that for purposes of admission merit is determined by government agencies. It is submitted that paragraph 68 provides that in unaided professional colleges only a \"certain\" percentage of seats can be reserved for admission by the management. It is submitted that the said paragraph provides that it is permissible for the University or the Government to require a private unaided professional institute to provide for a merit-based selection. It was submitted that paragraph 68, read with paragraph 59, lays down that in unaided professional colleges merit is to be determined by a common entrance test conducted by government agencies. 12. Paragraph 68 of the majority judgment in Pai case 1 can be split into seven parts: Firstly, it deals with the unaided minority or non-minority professional colleges. Secondly, it will be unfair to apply the rules and regulations framed by the State Government as regards the government-aided professional colleges to the unaided professional colleges. Thirdly, the unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration; while at the same time they should not forego or discard the principles of merit. Fourthly, it is permissible for the University or the Government at the time of granting recognition to require an unaided institution to provide for merit-based admission while at the same time giving the management sufficient discretion in admitting students. Fifthly, for unaided non-minority professional colleges certain percentage of seats can be reserved for admission by the management out of those students who have passed the common test held by itself or by 1 T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

Seventhly, the prescription for percentage of seats in unaided professional colleges has to be done by the Government according to the local needs. A different percentage of seats for admission can be fixed for minority unaided and non-minority unaided professional colleges. b 13. Undoubtedly, the majority judgment makes a distinction between private unaided professional colleges and other educational institutions i.e. schools and undergraduate colleges. The sub-heading \"Private unaided professional colleges\" includes both minority as well as non-minority professional colleges. This is also clear from a reading of paragraph 68. It appears to us that this distinction has been made (between private unaided c professional colleges and other educational institutions) as the judgment recognises that it is in national interest to have good and efficient professionals. The judgment provides that national interest would prevail, even over minority rights. It is for this reason that in professional colleges, both minority and non-minority, merit has been made the criterion for admission. However, a proper reading of paragraph 68, indicates that a d further distinction has been made between minority and non-minority professional colleges. It is provided that in cases of non-minority professional colleges \"a certain percentage of seats\" can be reserved for admission by the management. The rest have to be filled up on the basis of counselling by State agencies. The prescription of percentage has to be done by the Government according to local needs. Keeping this in mind provisions e have to be made for the poorer and backward sections of the society. It must be remembered that, so far as medical colleges are concerned, an essentiality certificate has to be obtained before the college can be set up. It cannot be denied that whilst issuing the essentiality certificate the respective State Governments take into consideration the local needs. These aspects have been highlighted in a recent decision of this Court in State of Maharashtra v. f Indian Medical Assn. 4 Whilst granting the essentiality certificate the State Government undertakes to take over the obligations of the private educational institution in the event of that institution becoming incapable of setting of the institution or imparting education therein. A reading of paragraphs 59 and 68 shows that in non-minority professional colleges admission of students, other than the percentage given to the management, can only be on the basis of g merit as per the common entrance tests conducted by government agencies. The manner in which the percentage given to the management can be filled in is set out hereinafter. 14. Paragraph 68 provides that a different percentage can be prescribed for unaided minority institutions.

Paragraph 47, which is one of the first paragraphs under this heading, inter alia provides as follows: (SCC p. 542) \"It is appropriate to first deal with the case of private unaided institutions and private aided institutions that are not administered by linguistic or religious minorities. Regulations that can be framed relating to minority institutions will be considered while examining the merit and effect of Article 30 of the Constitution.\" Whilst discussingt Article 30 under the heading \"To what extent can the rights of aided private minority institutions to administer be regulated\" reliance has been placed, in the majority judgment, on previous judgments in the cases of Kerala Education Bill, 1957, Re5 , Sidhajbhai Sabhai v. State of Gujara(', Rev. Father W. Proost v. State of Bihar7 , State of Kerala v. Very Rev. Mother Provincial8 and Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v. State of Gujarat3 • All these cases have recognised and upheld the rights of minorities under Article 30. These cases have held that in the guise of regulations, rights under Article 30 cannot be abrogated. It has been held, even in respect of aided minority institutions that they must have full autonomy in administration of that institution. It has been held that the right to administer includes the right to admit students of their own community/ language. Thus an unaided minority professional college cannot be in a worse position than an aided minority professional college. It is for this reason that paragraph 68 provides that a different percentage can be fixed for unaided minority professional colleges. The expression \"different percentage for minority professional institutions\" carries a different meaning than the expression \"certain percentage for unaided professional colleges\". In fixing the percentage for unaided minority professional colleges the State must keep in mind, apart from local needs, the interest/need of that community in the State. The need of that community, in the State, would be paramount vis-a- vis the local needs. 15. It must be clarified that minority professional colleges can admit, in their management quota, a student of their own community/language in preference to a student of another community even though that other student is more meritorious. However, whilst selecting/admitting students of their community/language the inter se merit of those students cannot be ignored. In other words, whilst selecting/admitting students of their own community/ language they cannot ignore the inter se merit amongst students of their community/language.

Further, if the seats cannot be filled up from members of their community/language, then the other students can be admitted only on the basis of merit based on a a common entrance test conducted by government agencies. 16. That brings us to the question as to how the management of both minority and non-minority professional colleges can admit students in the quota allotted to them. Undoubtedly, the majority judgment has kept in mind the sad reality that there are a large number of professional colleges which indulge in profiteering and/or charging of capitation fees. It is for this reason b that the majority judgment provides that in professional colleges admission must be on the basis of merit. As has been rightly submitted, it is impossible to control profiteering/charging of capitation fees unless it is ensured that admission is on the basis of merit. Also, as has been rightly pointed out, if a student is required to appear at more than one entrance test it would lead to great hardship. The application fees charged by each institute, even though c they may be only Rs 500 to Rs 1000 for each institute, would impose a heavy burden on the students who will necessarily have to apply to a number of colleges. Further, as has been rightly pointed out, students would have to arrange for transport from and to and stay at various places if they have to appear for individual tests conducted by each college. If a student has to go for test to each institute it is possible that he/she may not be able to reach, in d time, the venue of a test of a particular institute. In our view what is necessary is a practical approach keeping in mind the need for a merit-based selection. Paragraph 68 provides that admission by the management can be by a common entrance test held by \"itself or by the State/University\". The words \"common entrance test\" clearly indicate that each institute cannot hold a separate test. We thus hold that the management could select students, of e their quota, either on the basis of the common entrance test conducted by the State or on the basis of a common entrance test to be conducted by an association of all colleges of a particular type in that State e.g. medical, engineering or technical etc. The common entrance test, held by the association, must be for admission to all colleges of that type in the State. The option of choosing, between either of these tests, must be exercised before issuing of prospectus and after intimation to the concerned authority f and the Committee set up hereinafter. If any professional college chooses not to admit from the common entrance test conducted by the association then that college must necessarily admit from the common entrance test conducted by the State. After holding the common entrance test and declaration of results the merit list will immediately be placed on the notice-board of all colleges which have chosen to admit as per this test. A copy of the merit list g will also be forthwith sent to the concerned authority and the Committee. Selection of students must then be strictly on the basis of merit as per that merit list. Of course, as indicated earlier, minority colleges will be entitled to fill up their quota with their own students on the basis of inter se merit amongst those students.

At this juncture it is brought to our notice that several institutions, have since long, had their own admission procedure and that even though they have been admitting only students of their own community no finger has b ever been raised against them and no complaints have been made regarding fairness or transparency of the admission procedure adopted by them. These institutions submit that they have special features and that they stand on a different footing from other minority non-aided professional institutions. It is submitted that their cases are not based only on the right flowing from Article 3 0(1) but in addition they have some special features which require that they c be permitted to admit in the manner they have been doing for all these years. A reference is made to few such institutions i.e. Christian Medical College, Vellore, St. John's Hospital, Islamic Academy of Education etc. The claim of these institutions was disputed. However, we do not think it necessary to go into those questions. We leave it open to the institutions which have been established and who have had their own admission procedure for, at least, the d last 25 years to apply to the Committee set out hereinafter. 18. Lastly, it must be mentioned that it was urged by the learned counsel for the appellant that paragraph 68 of the majority judgment only permits the University/State to provide for merit-based selection at the time of granting recognition/affiliation. It was also submitted that once recognition/affiliation is granted to unaided professional colleges, such a stipulation cannot be e provided subsequently. We are unable to accept this submission. Such a provision can be made at the time of granting recognition/affiliation as well as subsequently after the grant of such recognition/affiliation. 19. We now direct that the respective State Governments do appoint a permanent Committee which will ensure that the tests conducted by the association of colleges is fair and transparent. For each State a separate f Committee shall be formed. The Committee would be headed by a retired Judge of the High Court. The Judge is to be nominated by the Chief Justice of that State. The other member, to be nominated by the Judge, would be a doctor or an engineer of eminence (depending on whether the institution is medical or engineering/technical). The Secretary of the State in charge of Medical or Technical Education, as the case may be, shall also be a member and act as the Secretary of the Committee. The Committee will be free to g nominate/co-opt an independent person of repute in the field of education as well as one of the Vice-Chancellors of the University in that State so that the total number of persons on the Committee do not exceed five. The Committee shall have powers to oversee the tests to be conducted by the association. This would include the power to call for the proposed question h paper(s), to know the names of the paper-setters and examiners and to check the method adopted to ensure papers are not leaked.

Before exempting any institute or varying in percentage of quota fixed by the State, the State Government must be heard before the Committee. It is clarified that different percentage of quota for students to be admitted by the management in each b minority or non-minority unaided professional college(s) shall be separately fixed on the basis of their need by the respective State Governments and in case of any dispute as regards fixation of percentage of quota, it will be open to the management to approach the Committee.

To meet the urgent situation without going into the issues involved in the various e petitions/applications, we direct that the seats be filled up by the institution and the State Governments in the ratio 50:50. However, if by any interim order, this Court has permitted any institution to fill up a higher percentage of seats and the seats have been filled up accordingly, the same shall not be disturbed. It is made clear that due to the time constraint this arrangement has been made, without deciding the contentious issue involved in various f pending cases. 22.

Some such institutions are aided by the State and some are unaided. 25. Privately managed educational institutions imparting professional education in the fields of medicine, dentistry and engineering have spurted in the last few decades. The right of the minorities to establish an institution of their own choice in terms of clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution of India is recognized; so is the right of a citizen who intends to establish an institution under Article 19(1)(g) thereof. However, the fundamental right of a citizen to establish an educational institution and in particular a professional institution is not absolute. These rights are subject to regulations and laws imposing reasonable restrictions. Such reasonable restrictions in public interest can be imposed under clause (6) of Article 19 and regulations under Article 30 of the Constitution of India. The right to establish an educational institution, although guaranteed under the Constitution, recognition or affiliation is not. Recognition or affiliation of professional institutions must be in terms of the statute. 26. Entry 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India provide for legislative field in this behalf. Various States have enacted laws for regulating admission and prohibiting charging of capitation fee. The said legislations also provide for employment of teachers, their conditions of service, discipline in institution and several other matters. Such regulatory measures have been the subject-matter of various decisions of this Court. Background 27. This Court in Unni Krishnan, J.P. v. State of A.P. 9 laid down a Scheme. In terms of the said Scheme the self-financed institutions were entitled to admit 50% of students of their choice, whereas rest of the seats were to be filled in by the State. For admission of students, a common entrance test was to be held. Provisions for free seats and payment seats were made therein. The State and various statutory authorities including the Medical Council of India, University Grants Commission and All India Council for Technical Education made and/or amended regulations so as to bring them on a par with the said Scheme. 28. The Islamic Academy of Education filed a writ petition in the year 1993 questioning the validity thereof. The said writ petition along with connected matters was placed before a Bench of five Judges, which was prima facie of the view that Article 30 of the Constitution of India did not clothe minority educational institutions with the power to adopt their own method of selecting students. 29. This Court in T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka 1 noticed the same, stating: (SCC pp. 529-30, paragraph 3) \"3. The hearing of these cases has had a chequered history.

As the Bench was prima facie of the opinion that Article 30 did not clothe a minority educational institution with the power to adopt its own method a of selection and the correctness of the decision of this Court in St. Stephen's College v. University of Delhi2 was doubted, it was directed that the questions that arose should be authoritatively answered by a larger Bench. These cases were then placed before a Bench of seven Judges. The questions framed were recast and on 6-2-1997, the Court directed that the matter be placed before a Bench of at least 11 Judges, as b it was felt that in view of the Forty-second Amendment to the Constitution, whereby 'education' had been included in Entry 25 of List III of Seventh Schedule, the question of who would be regarded as a 'minority' was required to be considered because the earlier case-law related to the pre-amendment era, when education was only in the State List. When the cases came up for hearing before an eleven-Judge Bench, c during the course of hearing on 19-3-1997, the following order was passed: 'Since a doubt has arisen during the course of our arguments as to whether this Bench would feel itself bound by the ratio propounded in - Kerala Education Bill, 1957, Re5 and Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v. State of Gujarat3 it is clarified that this d sized Bench would not feel itself inhibited by the views expressed in those cases since the present endeavour is to discern the true scope and interpretation of Article 30(1) of the Constitution, which being the dominant question would require examination in its pristine purity. The factum is recorded.' \" 30. The eleven-Judge Bench answered various questions raised therein. e 31. The petitioners/applicants before us are private unaided institutions. Most of them have been established by a society, trust or persons belonging to the minority community based on religion or language. 32. By reason of the impugned legislations/government orders, the State Governments, inter alia, while seeking to lay down the Government quota in relation to such unaided institutions, directed that while filling up the same, f the self-financed institutions must follow the merit list prepared by the State on the basis of External Common Entrance Test (CET). The State Governments also fixed/regulated fees to be charged from the students by such institutions. 33.

(ii) Such a fundamental right extends to education at all levels including professional education. (Paragraph 161) (iii) The right to establish and administer educational institutions comprises of the right to (a) admit students, (b) set up a reasonable fee structure, (c) constitute a governing body, (d) appoint staff and take disciplinary action. (Paragraph 50) (iv) Although such rights are subject to reasonable restrictions, but the same must be for the betterment of the institution and as such the right under Article 19(1)(g) and Article 30 cannot be undermined.

(Paragraph 38) Minority institutions are not to subsidize the c State nor can any principle of cross-subsidy be deciphered therefrom. (iii) In the case of unaided institutions, maximum autonomy has to be conceded as contradistinguished from the power of the State to exercise more control over aided institutions but even in relation thereto, aided institutions should not be treated to be wholly owned or controlled by the State or their Departments.

This committee should, after hearing the professional colleges, fix the fee once every three years or at such longer intervals, as it may think appropriate; (g) that it would be appropriate for the University Grants Commission to frame regulations under its Act regulating the fees that the affiliated colleges operating on a no-grant-in-aid basis were entitled to charge. AICTE, the Indian Medical Council and the Central Government were also given similar advice.

In T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 the Scheme framed by this Court restricting the right of the citizens to establish private unaided institutions including minority institutions and manage the same was held to be unconstitutional stating: (J) The Scheme enforced by the State Governments in relation to privately managed institutions would not be a reasonable restriction within the meaning of Article 19(6) of the Constitution of India as it resulted into revenue shortfalls making it difficult for the educational institutions. (2) The provision made for free seats and payment seats amounted to subsidising education of one segment of society at the cost of the other which was unreasonable having regard to the fact that higher education has been held not to be a fundamental right. 42. All orders and directions issued by the State pursuant to or in furtherance of the directions in Unni Krishnan 9 are, thus, also unconstitutional. 1 T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

The right of a minority educational institution to adopt its own method of selection is subject to the restrictions contained in clause (2) of a Article 29 of the Constitution of India, if the institution is an aided one. It was held that allowing minority educational institutions to select their own method of selection for admission of students to the extent of 50% of the seats would not impinge upon the right under Article 30 of the Constitution of India. It was further held that regulations can be imposed by the State for intake of minority categories with regard to the need of the minority in the b area which the institution intends to serve. 44. A question, however, arose therein as to whether the State could impose regulatory measures on the institution run by a minority community which provides for admission by conducting interviews but not solely on the marks obtained in the qualifying examination. In that case, the State had imposed restrictions on the college management compelling it to make c admission exclusively on the basis of marks obtained in the qualifying examination. But the management, in addition to the marks obtained by the students, also conducted interviews for making admission to the College. This Court observed that the denial of power to St. Stephen's College to conduct interviews to select candidates for admission would be violative of the rights of the minority community guaranteed under Article 30(1) of the d Constitution. It was held that, any regulatory measure imposed by the State on the minority institutions should be beneficial to the institution or for the betterment of those who join such institutions. 45. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 while upholding the judgment in St. Stephen2 that part of the direction whereby the right of the minority institutions were confined to 50% of the seats was held to be bad. e 46. From the above decisions of this Court, it is evident that though the right engrafted under Article 30(1) of the Constitution does not lay down any limitations or restrictions upon the right of a minority to administer its educational institutions, yet the right cannot be used absolutely and unreasonably. Questions posed in T.M.A. Pai Foundation 47. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 the Bench framed the following questions: 1. What is the meaning and content of the expression \"minorities\" in Article 30 of the Constitution of India? f 2. What is meant by the expression \"religion\" in Article 30(1)?

The right to administer, not being absolute, there could be regulatory measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof, and it is more so in the matter of admissions to professional institutions. A minority institution does not cease to be so, the moment grant-in- aid is received by the institution. An aided minority educational institution, therefore, would be entitled to have the right of admission of students belonging to the minority group and at the same time, would be required to admit a reasonable extent of non-minority students, so that the rights under Article 30(1) are not substantially impaired and further the citizens' rights under Article 29(2) are not infringed. What would be a reasonable extent, would vary from the types of institution, the courses of education for which admission is being sought and other factors like educational needs. The State Government concerned has to notify the percentage of the non-minority students to be admitted in the light of the above observations. Observance of inter se merit amongst the applicants belonging to the minority group could be ensured. In the case of aided professional institutions, it can also be stipulated that passing of the common entrance test held by the State agency is necessary to seek admission. As regards non-minority students who are eligible to seek admission for the remaining seats, admission should normally be on the basis of the common entrance test held by the State agency followed by counselling wherever it exists. A.5( a) A minority institution may have its own procedure and method of admission as well as selection of students, but such a procedure must be fair and transparent, and the selection of students in professional and higher education colleges should be on the basis of merit. The procedure adopted or selection made should not tantamount to maladministration. Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission, while exercising its right to admit students to the colleges as aforesaid, as in that event, the institution will fail to achieve excellence. A.5( b) While giving aid to professional institutions, it would be permissible for the authority giving aid to prescribe bye-rules or regulations, the conditions on the basis of which admission will be granted to different aided colleges by virtue of merit, coupled with the reservation policy of the State qua non-minority students. The merit may be determined either through a common entrance test conducted by the University or the Government concerned followed by counselling, or on the basis of an entrance test conducted by individual institutions - the method to be followed is for the University or the Government to decide. The authority may also devise other means to ensure that admission is granted to an aided professional institution on the basis of merit. In the case of such institutions, it will be permissible for the Government or the University to provide that consideration should be shown to the weaker sections of the society. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The right to establish and administer educational institutions was held to be guaranteed to citizens under Article 19(1 )(g) of the Constitution of India and to the minorities under Article 30. 54. One of us (Chief Justice Khare), while agreeing with the majority delivered a separate opinion relating to aided minority institutions and non- minority institutions as also interpretation of the right of the minorities under clause (1) of Article 30 vis-a-vis clause (2) of Article 29 and held that such right is limited by the conditions laid down in clause (2) of Article 29 and clause (3) of Article 28. 55. Quadri, J. agreed with the aforementioned view stating: (SCC p. 624, paragraph 259) \"259. In regard to the minorities seeking recognition and/or aid it was observed in Kerala Education Bill, 19575 that the minorities cannot surely ask for aid or recognition for an educational institution run by them in unhealthy surroundings, without any competent teachers, possessing any semblance of qualification, and which does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which teaches matters subversive of the welfare of the scholars. In such matters, 'the State can insist that in order to grant aid the State may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the institutions to be aided'. (emphasis supplied*) Thus, it is clear that regulations postulated for granting recognition or aid ought to be with regard to the excellence of education and efficiency of administration viz. to make certain healthy surroundings for the institutions, existence of competent teachers possessing requisite qualifications and maintaining fair standard of teaching. Such regulations are not restrictions on the right but merely deal with the aspects of proper administration of an educational institution, to ensure excellence of education and to avert maladministration in minority educational institutions and will, therefore, be permissible. This is on the principle that when the Constitution confers a right, any regulation framed by the State in that behalf should be to facilitate exercise of that right and not to frustrate it.\" Ruma Pal, J. also agreed with the said view stating: (SCC pp. 661-62, paragraphs 371-72) \"371. Similarly, the Constitution has also carved out a further exception to Article 29(2) in the form of Article 30(1) by recognising the rights of special classes in the form of minorities based on language or religion to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. The right of the minorities under Article 30(1) does not operate as discrimination against other citizens only on the ground of religion or language.

Although, it is not necessary to justify a classification made by the Constitution, this fact of 'minorityship' is the obvious rationale for making a distinction, a the underlying assumption being that minorities by their very numbers are in a politically disadvantaged situation and require special protection at least in the field of education. 372. Articles 15(4), 337 and 30 are therefore facets of substantive equality by making special provisions for special classes on special considerations.\" b 56. One of us (Variava, J.) speaking for himself and Bhan, J. agreed with the majority but thought it appropriate that a mechanism therefor should be set up observing: (SCC pp. 709-10, paragraph 450) \"So far as the statutory provisions regulating the facets of administration are concerned, in case of an unaided minority educational institution, the regulatory measure of control should be minimal and the c conditions of recognition as well as conditions of affiliation to a University or board have to be complied with, but in the matter of day-to- day management, like appointment of staff, teaching and non-teaching and administrative control over them, the management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency.

A delicate balance was sought to be struck by stipulating that minority educational institutions may admit non-minority students to a \"reasonable extent\" so that the rights of both minorities and non-minorities are protected. However, the extent to which such balance is to be struck may be determined by the State having regard to such factors as \"the type of institution\", \"course of education\", \"population and educational needs of minorities\". It was further laid down that the minority institutions are required to admit students having regard to inter se merit amongst the applicants. Non-minority students, who qualify the test, would be entitled to seek admission against the \"allotted seats\" as per their own respective cumulative merit. 59. However, one of us Variava, J., speaking for himself and Bhan, J. clearly held that where the minority institutions take aid from the State they do not have any right to admit students of minority community alone. For arriving at the said conclusion, the learned Judge referred to the history of the said provision and the intention of the founding fathers, which was the conferment of a right of minorities to establish \"a secular State wherein people belonging to the different religions should all have a feeling of equality and non-discrimination\"* (SCC p. 673, paragraph 401). 60. The learned Judge further referred (at SCC pp. 674 & 675, paragraph 403) to the significance of the conditional clause, \"at their own expense\" in Draft Article VI which reads as follows: \"Citizens belonging to national minorities in a State whether based on religion or language have equal rights with other citizens in forming, controlling and administering at their own expense, charitable, religious and social institutions, schools and other educational establishments with the free use of their language and practice of their religion. No legislation providing State aid for schools shall discriminate against schools under the management of minorities whether based on religion or language.\" 61. The learned Judge further observed that by reason of Article 30(1) no \"special\" or \"additional\" right is conferred on the minorities. 62. The expression \"minorities\", although is not defined in the Constitution, one of us Khare, C.J., referred to the Year Book on Human Rights (1950) and Encyclopaedia Britannica and some other standard works on the theme of protection of minorities. 63. Though in paragraph 153 the view regarding merit was expressed, but while answering Question 7 was left open to be answered by the appropriate Benches. * As per Khanna, J. in Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v.

It was further held a that education within the meaning of the provision of Article 30 would mean and include education from primary level to the postgraduate level and would include professional education as well. 65. The Bench, however, overruled the dicta in Unni Krishnan case9 that education is not a \"business\" or \"occupation\" within the meaning of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, wherein referring to State of Gujarat v. b R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala 10 and incorporating the doctrine of res extra commercium, the Court1 had observed: (SCC pp. 534-35, paragraph 24) \"24 .

While declaring that the Scheme framed in Unni Krishnan case9 and the directions issued to the Government, UGC and other concerned bodies to give effect to the same vis-a-vis privately managed educational institutions as d unconstitutional, it upheld two propositions: (J) primary education is a fundamental right; and (2) the institution cannot charge any capitation fee or otherwise take recourse to profiteering. 67.

With a view to appreciate the extent to which the scheme formulated in Unni Krishnan 9 was not found favour with T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 we may set out the observations of this Court in T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 as follows: 1. Establishment of educational institutions All citizens have a right to establish and administer educational institutions under Articles 19(1 )(g) and 26, but this right is subject to provisions of Articles 19( 6) and 26-A. (See answer to Questions 10 and 11.) 2. Admission to courses (i) Private unaided professional colleges: (a) Admission to professional colleges should be based on merit by a common entrance test conducted by the government agencies. (See paragraph 59.) (b) Certain percentage of seats can be reserved for admission by management out of those students who have passed the common entrance test held by itself or by the State agency and the rest of the seats may be filled up on the basis of counselling by the State agency. Prescription by percentage has to be determined by the Government according to local needs. (See paragraph 68.) (c) When one considers the Constitution Bench's earlier statements that higher education is not a fundamental right, it seems unreasonable to compel a citizen to pay for the education of another, more so in the unrealistic world of competitive examinations which assess the merit for the purpose of admission solely on the basis of marks obtained, where urban students always have an edge over rural students. Those who seek professional education must pay for it. (See paragraphs 37 and 70.) (ii) Private aided professional institutions: It would be permissible for the authority giving aid to prescribe by rules or regulations the conditions on the basis of which the admissions shall be granted to different aided colleges by virtue of merit coupled with the reservation policy of the State. The merit may be determined either through the common entrance test conducted by the University or the Government followed by counselling or on the basis of an entrance test conducted by individual institution, and method to be followed is for the Government or the University to decide. (iii) Private aided minority institutions: The State Government is not entitled to interfere with the right of minority educational institutions to admit students of their choice so long as the admission is on a transparent basis and the merit is adequately taken care of. The right not being absolute, there could be regulatory measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof, especially in the case of admission to professional institutions.

Ltd. ~cccc® ION LINE;:' True Prinf 750 SUPREME COURT CASES (2003) 6 sec (iv) Unaided minority institutions: Such institutions would have the right of admission of students belonging to minority groups and at the same time would be required to a admit reasonable extent of non-minority students as notified by the State Government. In case of professional institutions it can also be stipulated that passing of a common entrance test held by the State agency is necessary to seek admission. [P. 588, Questions 4, 5(a) and 5(b)] 3. Reservation of seats While the State has a right to prescribe qualifications necessary for b admission, private unaided colleges have right to admit students of their choice subject to objective and rational procedure of selection and the compliance with the conditions, if any, requiring admission of certain percentage of students belonging to weaker sections by granting them free scholarships or scholarships if not granted by the Government (paragraph 53). C 4. Fee structure (i) Scheme of \"free\" and \"payment\" seats was evolved on the presumption that the economic capacity of 50 per cent of admitted students would be greater than the remaining 50%, whereas the converse has proved to be the reality. In this Scheme, the \"payment-seat\" student would not only d pay for his own seat, but also finance the cost of a \"free-seat\" classmate. It seems unreasonable to compel a citizen to pay for the education of another, more so, in the unrealistic world of competitive examinations which assess the merit for the purpose of admission solely on the basis of marks obtained where urban students always have an edge over rural students. In practice, it has been the case of the marginally less merited rural or poor students bearing the burden of rich and well-exposed and urban students. (See e paragraph 3 7.) (ii) The decision in Unni Krishnan 9 insofar as it framed the Scheme relating to grant of admission and fixing fee was not correct, and to that extent the said decision and consequent direction given to UGC, AICTE, Medical Council of India, Central and State Governments etc. is overruled. (Paragraph 45) f (iii) A rational fee structure should be adopted by the management and it would not be entitled to charge capitation fee and appropriate machinery can be devised by the State or University to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and that there is no profiteering, though a reasonable surplus in furtherance of education is permissible. The conditions of granting recognition or affiliation can broadly cover academic and educational matters g including the welfare of students and teachers. (Paragraph 69, Question 9) 71. The problem presented in these matters should be viewed from the aforementioned perspective. 72. There is a fundamental right to set up educational institutions both under Article 19(1)(g) and Article 30 of the Constitution of India.

STATE OF KARNATAKA ( Sinha, J.) 75 l the scheme framed by this Court in Unni Krishnan 9 did not impose reasonable restrictions within the meaning of clause (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution of India. The unaided institutions compared to the aided institutions will have more autonomy to run the institutions. However, in the matter of non-professional institutions, the autonomy is absolute which is not the case in professional institutions. 73. The right to establish and administer an institution comprises of the right: (a) to admit students; (b) to set up a reasonable fee structure; (c) to constitute a Governing Body; (d) to appoint staff (teaching and non-teaching); and (e) to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of the employees. (SCC para 50, p. 542) 74. As regards fee structure, it was held that the fixing of a rigid fee structure, dictating the formation and composition of a Governing Body, compulsory nomination of teachers and staff for appointment or nominating students for admissions would be unacceptable restrictions. Although an educational institution is not a business, in order to examine the degree of independence that can be given to a recognized educational institution, like any private entity that does not seek aid or assistance from the Government, and that exists by virtue of the funds generated by it, including its loans or borrowings, it is important to note that the essential ingredients of the management of the private institution include the admission of students and recruiting staff, and the quantum of fee that is to be charged. (SCC paras 54 and 55, pp. 544 and 545) 75. An educational institution is established for the purpose of imparting education of the type made available by the institution. Different courses of study are usually taught by teachers who have to be recruited as per qualifications that may be prescribed. It is no secret that better working conditions will attract better teachers. More amenities will ensure that better students seek admission to that institution. One cannot lose sight of the fact that providing good amenities to the students in the form of competent teaching faculty and other infrastructure costs money. It has, therefore, to be left to the institution, if it chooses not to seek any aid from the Government, to determine the scale of fee that it can charge from the students. One also cannot lose sight of the fact that we live in a competitive world today, where professional education is in demand. We have been given to understand that a large number of professional and other institutions have been started by private parties who do not seek any governmental aid. In a sense, a prospective student has various options open to him/her where, therefore, normally economic forces have a role to play. The decision on the fee to be charged must necessarily be left to the private educational institution that does not seek or is not dependent upon any funds from the Government.

Since the object of setting up of an educational institution is charitable in nature, capitation fee and profiteering cannot be allowed to be indulged in: a (a) although the institutions may generate a reasonable revenue surplus for the purpose of development of education and expansion of the institutions. (SCC para 57, p. 545) (b) For admission in professional institutions, merit must play an important role and meritorious candidates should not be treated unfairly b or put at a disadvantage by preferences shown to less meritorious but more influential applicants. (SCC para 58, pp. 545-46) 77. Excellence in professional education would require that greater emphasis be laid on the merit of a student seeking admission for which appropriate regulations can be made. (SCC para 58, p. 546) 78. As regards determination of merit, it was stated: (SCC p. 546, c paragraph 59) \"59. Merit is usually determined, for admission to professional and higher education colleges, by either the marks that the student obtains at the qualifying examination or school-leaving certificate stage followed by the interview, or by a common entrance test conducted by the d institution, or in the case of professional colleges, by government agencies.\" 79. Educational institutions, however, cannot grant admission on their whims and fancies and must follow some identifiable or reasonable methodology of admitting the students. Any scheme, rule or regulation that does not give an institution the right to reject candidates who might otherwise e be qualified according to, say, their performance in an entrance test, would be an unreasonable restriction under Article 19(6), though appropriate guidelines/modalities can be prescribed for holding the entrance test in a fair manner. Even when students are required to be selected on the basis of merit, the ultimate decision to grant admission to the students who have otherwise qualified for the grant of admission must be left with the educational f institution concerned. However, when the institution rejects some students, such rejection must not be whimsical or for extraneous reasons. (SCC para 65, p. 548-49) 80. The principles governing private unaided professional colleges were dealt with separately in paragraphs 67, 68 and 69, the relevant portions whereof read thus: g \"68. It would be unfair to apply the same rules and regulations regulating admission to both aided and unaided professional institutions. It must be borne in mind that unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration while, at the same time, they do not forgo or discard the principle of merit.

This can be done through various methods. For instance, a certain percentage of the seats can be reserved for admission by the management out of those students who have passed the common entrance test held by itself or by the State/University and have applied to the college concerned for admission, while the rest of the seats may be filled up on the basis of counselling by the State agency. This will incidentally take care of poorer and backward sections of the society. The prescription of percentage for this purpose has to be done by the Government according to the local needs and different percentages can be fixed for minority unaided and non-minority unaided and professional colleges. The same principles may be applied to other non- professional but unaided educational institutions viz. graduation and postgraduation non-professional colleges or institutes. 69. In such professional unaided institutions, the management will have the right to select teachers as per the qualifications and eligibility conditions laid down by the State/University subject to adoption of a rational procedure of selection. A rational fee structure should be adopted by the management, which would not be entitled to charge a capitation fee. Appropriate machinery can be devised by the State or University to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and that there is no profiteering, though a reasonable surplus for the furtherance of education is permissible.

Although the parties have raised their contentions as regards constitutionality of some of the provisions of the aforementioned statutes, keeping in view the limited scope for which this Constitution Bench has been constituted, we refrain ourselves from going thereinto. This exercise has to be undertaken in appropriate cases. Are the rights under Article 19(1)(g) and Article 30(1) of the Constitution b of India equal? 89. T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 for the first time brought into existence the concept of education as an \"occupation\". In no uncertain terms, it was held that all citizens of India irrespective of the fact as to whether they belong to a minority group or not have a right to establish and run an institution. A right conferred on a citizen of India in terms of Article 19( 1 )(g) of the Constitution c of India, indisputably, is subject to reasonable restrictions, which may be imposed in public interest under clause (6) thereof. The makers of the Constitution no doubt while enacting Article 30 of the Constitution of India intended to confer on the minorities the same right as that of the majority. But, does it mean that for all intent and purport no further or additional right exists in the minority community, is the question. d 90. Drawing our attention to paragraphs 54, 65, 138, 139, 224-29 of the judgment, Mr Venugopal and Mr Vaidyanathan, the learned Senior Counsel for the respondents would submit that the minority right is equal to that of the majority and not vice versa. According to the learned counsel, if it is to be held that the minority exercises a higher right than the majority, the same would be counterproductive to the Indian ethos. Right to admit students of e their own choice, the learned counsel would contend, in a professional college, therefore, is not absolute. 91. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitioners/applicants would contend that the discussions in T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 centred around the question as to whether the right conferred upon minorities under Article 30 was subject to clause (2) of Article 29 or f not. Our attention was drawn to paragraphs 31 to 45 of the judgment and in particular paragraphs 31, 45 and 459 of the judgment. The learned counsel would submit that while considering the question as to whether the scheme framed by this Court in Unni Krishnan9 was reasonable, it was categorically held that the provisions contained therein to the extent that 50% seats would be free seats and 50% thereof would be payment seats and all examinations g would be conducted through Common Entrance Test (CET) and the ceiling on fees was declared unconstitutional as being violative of clause ( 6) of Article 19 of the Constitution of India. It was submitted that in the event if it be held that the said provisions are ultra vires for the purpose of clause (6) of Article 19, the same consequences must ensue for construction of Article 30 of the Constitution of India.

A citizen of India whether belonging to a minority community or not will have the right under Article 19. A person belonging to a minority b community apart from Article 19(1 )(g) has a right to establish and administer institution of his choice. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 this Court held that minorities can establish and run a professional institution in terms of clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution having regard to the fact that they have a right to establish an institution of their own choice. 93. A citizen of India with a view to establish an unaided professional c institution exercises his right of occupation. To the said extent, admittedly, the right of the minority and non-minority is equal. Article 30, however, seeks further to protect the minorities so that they may admit students in the institution established by them. This privilege is not extended to the non-minority community. They also have a right to establish an institution and admit students of their own choice in terms of paragraph 68 of the d judgment in T.M.A. Pai1 but they do not have any right of admitting students belonging to a particular locality or speaking a particular language as such institutions are not meant to serve the said purpose. But the same for all intent and purport, having regard to the question involved in the matter, may not be of much consequence as would appear from the discussions made hereinafter. e 94. The Bench held: (SCC p. 539, paragraph 36) \"36. The private unaided educational institutions impart education, and that cannot be the reason to take away their choice in matters, inter alia, of selection of students and fixation of fees. Affiliation and recognition has to be available to every institution that fulfils the conditions for grant of such affiliation and recognition. The private f institutions are right in submitting that it is not open to the Court to insist that statutory authorities should impose the terms of the scheme as a condition for grant of affiliation or recognition; this completely destroys the institutional autonomy and the very objective of establishment of the institution.\" 95.

By framing this scheme, which has led to the State Governments legislating in conformity with the scheme, the private institutions are indistinguishable from the government institutions; curtailing all the essential features of the right of administration of a private unaided educational institution can neither be called fair nor reasonable. Even in the decision in Unni Krishnan case9 it has been observed by Jeevan Reddy, J., at page 749, paragraph 194, as follows: '194. The hard reality that emerges is that private educational institutions are a necessity in the present-day context. It is not possible to do without them because the Governments are in no position to meet the demand - particularly in the sector of medical and technical education which call for substantial outlays. While education is one of the most important functions of the Indian State it has no monopoly therein. Private educational institutions - including minority educational institutions - too have a role to play.'\" (emphasis supplied) However, it was also noticed: (SCC pp. 578-79, paragraphs 138-39) \"138. As we look at it, Article 30(1) is a sort of guarantee or assurance to the linguistic and religious minority institutions of their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Secularism and equality being two of the basic features of the Constitution, Article 30(1) ensures protection to the linguistic and religious minorities, thereby preserving the secularism of the country. Furthermore, the principles of equality must necessarily apply to the enjoyment of such rights. No law can be framed that will discriminate against such minorities with regard to the establishment and administration of educational institutions vis-a-vis other educational institutions. Any law or rule or regulation that would put the educational institutions run by the minorities at a disadvantage when compared to the institutions run by the others will have to be struck down. At the same time, there also cannot be any reverse discrimination. It was observed in St. Xavier's College case3 at SCR p. 192 that: (SCC p. 743, paragraph 9) 'The whole object of conferring the right on minorities under Article 30 is to ensure that there will be equality between the majority and the minority. If the minorities do not have such special protection they will be denied equality.' In other words, the essence of Article 30(1) is to ensure equal treatment between the majority and the minority institutions. No one type or category of institution should be disfavoured or, for that matter, receive more favourable treatment than another. Laws of the land, including rules and regulations, must apply equally to the majority institutions as well as 9 (1993) 1 sec 645 3 Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v.

They will have to comply with the conditions of recognition, which cannot be such as to whittle down the right under Article 30.\" (emphasis in original) 96. The findings of this Court in the aforementioned paragraphs must be b given their full effect. Although the width and scope of Article 19(l)(g) and Article 30 are different, but they seek to fulfil the same purpose. A minority institution has no additional rights but it enjoys a constitutional protection to admit students belonging to the minority communities whether based on religion or language. All regulations in this behalf must satisfy the requirement of Article 30. The doctrine of equality shall further apply once c the institutions have been established. 97. We may notice that this Court in Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College3 stated: (SCC p. 774, paragraph 79) \"In order to attain that object, two things were regarded as particularly necessary, and have formed the subject of provisions in these d treaties. The first is to ensure that nationals belonging to racial, religious or linguistic minorities shall be placed in every respect on a footing of perfect equality with the other nationals of the State. The second is to ensure for the minority elements suitable means for the preservation of their racial peculiarities, their traditions and their national characteristics. These two requirements are indeed closely interlocked, for there e would be no true equality between a majority and a minority if the latter were deprived of its own institutions and were consequently compelled to renounce that which constitutes the very essence of its being a minority.\" 98. The purport and object for which Article 30(1) was inserted in the Constitution cannot be lost sight of. Judgments of Khare, J. (as the C.J. then f was) and Variava, J. are replete with the Debates in the Constituent Assembly. 99. The argument that the management of the minority institutions cannot be taken over, whereas that of the non-minority institutions can be, is misplaced and in any event irrelevant. This Court in no unmistakable terms held that the State cannot take any step by way of imposing conditions at the time of grant of recognition which would amount to nationalization of 9 education. This applies to both minorities and non-minorities. 100. The Constitution prohibits acquisition of property of any citizen of India except in accordance with law. Any action taken on the part of the State to take over the property of a minority institution must also receive legal sanction through an act of a legislation and not otherwise. h 3 Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v.

It will not be a correct proposition of law, on the face of clause (1-A) of Article 30 of the Constitution to contend that the properties of the minority institutions cannot be taken over at all. The only right which they have is to get reasonable compensation so as to enable them to establish another educational institution at some other place. It is not necessary to raise a hypothetical question to drive home a point which is of not much consequence. As and when laws are made, their constitutionality will have to be tested on their own merit. Pre-emptive answers should not be given on hypothetical questions. 102. Furthermore, in the event, running of a minority institution is found to be against the national interest or permissible limits of regulations, it can be taken over with a view to maintain morality, public order, health, national interest. Similar such considerations would empower the State to close the institution or take over the management thereof, although the same may be done only in extreme cases. 103. In case of gross mismanagement and violation of the conditions of essentiality certificate also, the State may be held to have the power to close down the institution. 104. The right of the minority institutions to admit their own students, in other words, is only by way of protection of the minorities' interest so that they may get the benefit of the equality clause. Such a protection should not be confused to be a right. This is evident not only from paragraphs 138 and 139 of the judgment but also from paragraph 371, (opinion of Ruma Pal, J.). 105. The statement of law contained in paragraphs 138 and 139 is absolutely clear and unambiguous and no exception can be taken thereto. The doubt, if any, that the minorities have a higher right in terms of Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India may be dispelled in clearest terms inasmuch as the right of the minorities and non-minorities is equal. Only certain additional protection has been conferred under Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India to bring the minorities on the same platform as that of non-minorities as regards the right to establish and administer an educational institution for the purpose of imparting education to the members of their own community whether based on religion or language. 106. Demographically, every Indian can become a minority having regard to the fact that even Hindus are in minority in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and some other States in north-east of India. Even Hindi-speaking people except in northern India are in minority in other parts of the country. 107. The question, thus, has to be considered keeping in view the fact that every Indian may be a minority, either based on religion or language, in one part of the country or the other. The right of a citizen as a minority in one part of the country cannot be higher than his right as a member of majority in another part of the country. 108. Furthermore, one of us (Variava, J.) speaking for himself and Bhan, J. clearly said: (SCC p. 690, paragraph 426) \"Article 30 merely protects the right of the minority to establish and administer an educational institution i.e. to have the same rights as those ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It is for the institution to decide whether it wants to receive aid. If it decides to take State aid then Article 30(2) merely provides that the State will not a discriminate against it. When State, whilst giving aid, asks the minority educational institute to comply with a constitutional mandate, it can hardly be said that the State is discriminating against that institute. The State is bound to ensure that all educational institutes, whether majority or minority, comply with the constitutional mandate.\" (emphasis supplied) b 109. The right of the minorities in the matter of admission of students can also be restricted like the non-minorities. T.M.A. Pai 1 says so. 110. The professional institutions indisputably are governed by statutes like the MCI Act, the AICTE Act and the UGC Act. In terms of the provisions of the statutes and the regulations framed thereunder, the private professional institutions are required to maintain certain standards. They c cannot be deviated or departed from. In the context of giving admissions to the meritorious students, it cannot be said that the students belonging to the minority community shall be admitted without reference to merit. 111. The courts, it is relevant to place on record, would not encourage establishment of pseudo-minority institutions imparting professional courses. d The statutory rules and regulations, thus, must be equally applied to all the professional institutions whether aided or unaided, whether run by a minority or non-minority. In the matter of maintenance of standard, these institutions must be equally treated. 112. If it be held that the minority institutions can admit all the students belonging to their own community whereas the non-minority institutions e cannot, the same, in my opinion, would amount to rewriting the judgment. 113. The arguments which have been advanced in this behalf, if accepted, would clearly lead to the conclusion that the majority decision in T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 is wrong. 114. Even while laying down the law in terms of Articles 15(3), 15(4), 16(1) and 16(4), the object is to attain equality. Reverse discrimination even f in the majority judgment has been frowned upon. Can we say that the right of the minorities is higher than the other disadvantaged group? Possibly not, having regard to Part III of the Constitution. 115. It is interesting to note that recently in Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher v. Lee Bollinger11 decided by the US Supreme Court, the guidelines providing for selection method under which every applicant from g an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group was to be automatically awarded 20 points out of 100 points needed to guarantee admission, was struck down as being violative of the equality protection clause.

Since college admission is not left entirely to inarticulate intuition, it is hard to see what is inappropriate in assigning some stated value to a relevant characteristic, whether it be reasoning ability, writing style, running speed, or minority race. Justice Powell's plus factors necessarily are assigned some values. The college simply does by a numbered scale what the law school accomplishes in its 'holistic review', Grutter, post, at 25; the distinction does not imply that applicants to the undergraduate college are denied individualized consideration or a fair chance to compete on the basis of all the various merits their applications may disclose.\" 116. Justice Ginsburg, however, speaking for himself and Justice Souter in their minority opinion stated: \"Our jurisprudence ranks race a 'suspect' category, 'not because (race) is inevitably an impermissible classification, but because it is one which usually, to our national shame, has been drawn for the purpose of maintaining racial inequality'. Nonvalk Core v. Nonvalk Redevelopment Agency12 (footnote omitted). But where race is considered 'for the purpose of achieving equality,' ibid., at 932, no automatic proscription is in order. For as insightfully explained, 'the Constitution is both color- blind and color-conscious'. To avoid conflict with the equal protection clause, a classification that denies a benefit, causes harm, or imposes a burden must not be based on race. In that sense, the Constitution is color- blind. But the Constitution is color-conscious to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past discrimination. United States v. Jefferson County Bd. of Ed. 13 (Wisdom, J.): see Wechsler, The Nationalization of Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Supp. to 12 Tex.Q.10, 23(1968) (Brown may be seen as disallowing racial classifications that 'imply an invidious assessment' while allowing such classifications when 'not invidious in implication' but advanced to 'correct inequalities'). Contemporary human rights documents draw just this line; they distinguish between policies of oppression and measures designed to accelerate de facto equality. See Grutter, post, at 1 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (citing the United Nations initiated Conventions on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women).\" 117. It is not necessary to express any opinion on this judgment one way or the other but it is referred to as the same points out two different viewpoints.

Human history would show that the struggle of man for democratic polity was inspired by a desire to achieve equality among them. Indeed, some of the world constitutions in their preamble abhor inequality and proclaim to a achieve equality in all respects. Whatever may be the power and jurisdiction of the State and State authorities to make a special provision in favour of the backward and the downtrodden, when the court tests the reasonableness of such distinctive State action, it should be done by posing a question whether such State action to ameliorate social, economic and political poverty; whatever be the reason, delays the journey towards the proclaimed goal of b equality. If a measure tends to perpetuate inequality and makes the goal of equality a mirage, such measure should not receive the approval of the Court. The Court, in such circumstances, has to mould the relief by indicating what would be the reasonable measure or action which furthers the object of achieving equality. The concept of equality is not a doctrinaire approach. It is a binding thread which runs through the entire constitutional text. An c affirmative action may, therefore, be constitutionally valid by reason of Articles 15(4) and 16(4) and various directive principles of State policy, but the Court cannot ignore the constitutional moralityt which embraces in itself the doctrine of equality. It would be constitutionally immoral to perpetuate inequality among majority people of the country in the guise of protecting the constitutional rights of minorities and constitutional rights of the d backward and downtrodden. All the rights of these groups are part of the right to social development which cannot render national interest and public interest subservient to right of an individual or right of a community. 119. In the event the minorities are not granted the right to establish educational institutions of their choice and admit students of their community, the right of equality would lose all its purpose and relevance. It e is in that sense the rights of the majority and minority must be held to be equal. In my opinion the provisions of Articles 19(1)(g), 29(2) and 30 must be so construed.

The purported right of the States to prescribe a certain percentage of seats for their nominees including those belonging to the reserved-category candidates is said to have arisen from: (i) The State grants essentiality certificate in terms whereof in the event of closure of the institution the State undertakes to take over. (ii) The States have a duty to enforce the directive principles of State d policy in terms of Articles 3 8, 41, 45 and 4 7 of the Constitution of India. 126. The directive principles of State policy contained in Part IV of the Constitution of India are not justiciable. 127. Equality clauses contained in Part III of the Constitution are to be found in Articles 14, 15 and 16. Whereas Article 14 mandates equality amongst all sections of people, Articles 15 and 16 deal with the matters e specified therein, namely, prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth and equality of opportunities in matters of public employment. 128.

Such a legislation or executive order would be in relation to the State action. The said provisions cannot be extended by way of imposition of restriction or regulation so as to impair the right of a citizen of India under Article 19(1 )(g) or Article 30 thereof. The question which may arise is as to whether the State can mandate upon an industry or a business house (for example) to provide job to a person belonging to a reserve category. If not, the necessary corollary would be that such a restriction or regulation cannot be imposed on a citizen carrying on an \"occupation\". The right of a citizen in terms of Article 19(1 )(g) of the Constitution whether \"to practise any profession\" or \"to carry on any business/occupation\" must be the same or similar. The reasonable restrictions in terms of clause (6) must be on the exercise of a right conferred by the said sub-clause. Although reasonable restrictions can be imposed on exercise of such right in terms of the constitutional scheme, the State cannot impose its own duties and obligations upon a citizen. 130. Furthermore, clauses (3) and (4) of Article 15 are enabling provisions. The States were to take appropriate steps required therefor within the bounds, that is, limited only for uplifting the weaker sections and not for conferring upon them a preferential right.

To pamper to the selfish claims of these minorities is, according to learned counsel, to set back the hands of the clock of progress.

It is not for this Court to question the wisdom of the supreme law of the land. We the people of a India have given unto ourselves the Constitution which is not for any particular community or section but for all. Its provisions are intended to protect all, minority as well as the majority communities. There can be no manner of doubt that our Constitution has guaranteed certain cherished rights of the minorities concerning their language, culture and religion. These concessions must have been made to them for good and b valid reasons. Article 45, no doubt, requires the State to provide for free and compulsory education for all children, but there is nothing to prevent the State from discharging that solemn obligation through government and aided schools and Article 45 does not require that obligation to be discharged at the expense of the minority communities. So long as the Constitution stands as it is and is not altered, it is, we conceive, the duty c of this Court to uphold the fundamental rights and thereby honour our sacred obligation to the minority communities who are of our own. Throughout the ages endless inundations of men of diverse creeds, cultures and races - Aryans and non-Aryans, Dravidians and Chinese, Scythians, Huns, Pathans and Mughals - have come to this ancient land from distant regions and climes. India has welcomed them all. They have d met and gathered, given and taken and got mingled, merged and lost in one body. India's tradition has thus been epitomised in the following noble lines: 'None shall be turned away From the shore of this vast sea of humanity That is India' (Poems by Rabindranath Tagore.) Indeed India has sent out to the world her message of goodwill enshrined and proclaimed in our national anthem: 'Day and night, thy voice goes out from land to land, calling Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains round thy throne and Parsees, Mussalmans and Christians. Offerings are brought to thy shrine by the East and the West to be woven in a garland of love.

(Rabindranath Tagore) It is thus that the genius of India has been able to find unity in diversity by assimilating the best of all creeds and cultures. Our Constitution accordingly recognises our sacred obligations to the minorities. Looking at the rights guaranteed to the minorities by our Constitution from the angle of vision indicated above, we are of opinion that clause 7 (except sub-clauses 1 and 3 which apply only to aided schools) and clause 10 may well be regarded as permissible regulation which the State is entitled to impose as a condition for according its recognition to any educational institution but that clause 20 which has been extended by clause 3(5) to newly established recognised schools, insofar as it affects educational institutions established and administered by minority communities is violative of Article 30(1).\" 132. Mathew, J. speaking for a nine-Judge Bench of this Court in Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society3 laid down that the State necessity cannot be foisted upon the minority. It was held: (SCC pp. 811-12, paragraph 174) \"174. We find it impossible to subscribe to the proposition that State necessity is the criterion for deciding whether a regulation imposed on an educational institution takes away or abridges the right under Article 30(1 ). If a legislature can impose any regulation which it thinks necessary to protect what in its view is in the interest of the State or society, the right under Article 30(1) will cease to be a fundamental right. It sounds paradoxical that a right which the Constitution-makers wanted to be absolute can be subjected to regulations which need only satisfy the nebulous and elastic test of State necessity. The very purpose of incorporating this right in Part III of the Constitution in absolute terms in marked contrast with the other fundamental rights was to withdraw it from the reach of the majority. To subject the right today to regulations dictated by the protean concept of State necessity as conceived by the majority would be to subvert the very purpose for which the right was given.\" 133. This Court in Suneel Jatley v. State of Haryana 16 held that reservations for students coming from rural areas would be bad in law. Local needs 134. It is difficult to define precisely what would constitute \"local needs\". Mr Venugopal refers to the Medical Council of India Regulations, h 3 Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v.

The State Government alone would be in a position to determine local needs which a may be based, for instance, in the case of doctors, on the ratio of doctors to the population of the State. Other factors such as the percentage of the relevant minority in the State, the number of minority professional colleges belonging to that particular linguistic/religious minority in the State, percentage of poorer and backward sections in the State, total number of professional colleges therein, contends Mr Venugopal, would be relevant b factors. This may be so, but similarly there are many more factors that would contribute to local needs. The criteria laid down in the MCI Regulations no doubt provide for some guidelines for the purpose of determination of local needs but the same cannot be said to be exhaustive. Local needs would vary from State to State. Even development of a backward area may be a local need. Absence of good educational institutions in a particular area may also c be a local need. The State may, in pursuit of its policy for the development of the people, consider it expedient to encourage entrepreneurs for establishing educational institutions in remote and backward areas for the benefit of the local people. Local needs, therefore, cannot be defined only with reference to the State as a unit. For good reasons the State may not like to establish professional colleges or institutions only in their capitals. d Essentiality certificate 135. Although local needs, thus, may have to be determined keeping in view the factors enumerated therein but it must also be noticed that no essentiality certificate is required to be given by the State in relation to engineering and other professional colleges. While laying down the law based on interpretation of a constitution as well as a judgment, we cannot e take a myopic view and hold that \"local needs\" must be referable to the medical education. Furthermore, it may be difficult to give a restrictive meaning to the expression \"local needs\" i.e. keeping the same confined to the area where the educational institution is sought to be established inasmuch as the right of minority extends to the entire State and, thus, the local needs may also have direct nexus having regard to the needs of the State. f 136. In State of Maharashtra v. Indian Medical Assn. 4 this Court did not decide the question as to whether the expression \"technical education\" occurring in Article 371(2)(c) of the Constitution is distinct and different from \"medical education\". The questions which arise for consideration herein did not arise there. 137. In Indian Medical Assn. case4 this Court was concerned with the g Maharashtra University of Health Sciences Act, 1998 wherein the question revolved round as to whether the essentiality certificate would be necessary for the State to establish a government-run medical college. 138.

It will not, therefore, be correct to contend, as has been contended a by Mr Nariman, that answers to the questions would be the ratio to a judgment. The answers to the questions are merely conclusions. They have to be interpreted, in a case of doubt or dispute with the reasons assigned in support thereof in the body of the judgment, wherefor, it would be essential to read the other paragraphs of the judgment also. It is also permissible for this purpose (albeit only in certain cases and if there exist strong and cogent b reasons) to look to the pleadings of the parties. 144. In Keshav Chandra Joshi v. Union of India26 this Court when faced with difficulties where specific guidelines had been laid down for determination of seniority in Direct Recruit Class II Eng g. Officers' Assn. v. State of Maharashtra21 held that the conclusions have to be read along with C the discussions and the reasons given in the body of the judgment. 145. It is further trite that a decision is an authority for what it decides and not what can be logically deduced therefrom. (See Union of India v. Chajju Ram28.) 146. The judgment of this Court in T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 will, therefore, have to be construed or to be interpreted on the aforementioned d principles. The Court cannot read some sentences from here and there to find out the intent and purport of the decision by not only considering what has been said therein but the text and context in which it was said. For the said purpose the Court may also consider the constitutional or relevant statutory provisions vis-a-vis its earlier decisions on which reliance has been placed. Fee structure e 147. On a bare reading of the relevant paragraphs of the judgment, some of which are referred to hereinbefore, it is beyond any doubt that in the matter of determination of the fee structure the unaided institutions exercise a greater autonomy. They, like any other citizen carrying on an occupation, must be held to be entitled to a reasonable surplus for development of f education and expansion of the institution. Reasonable surplus doctrine can be given effect to only if the institutions make profits out of their investments. As stated in paragraph 56, economic forces have a role to play. They, thus, indisputably have to plan their investment and expenditure in such a manner that they may generate some amount of profit. What is forbidden is: (a) capitation fee, and (b) profiteering. g 24 (1985) 1 sec 345 : 1985 sec (Tax) 92 25 c2001) 7 sec 573 26 1992 Supp (1) sec 212: 1993 sec (L&S) 694: (1993) 24ATC 545 21 (1990) 2 sec 715 : 1990 sec (L&S) 339: (1990) 13 ATC 348 28 c2003) 5 sec 568 1 T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

However, the different State Governments have prescribed different amounts by way of fees as would appear from the following: a State Fee b C Andhra Pradesh Delhi Gujarat Haryana Karnataka Kerala TamilNadu Uttar Pradesh Rs 22,000 per annum Rs 45,000 per annum Government seats -Rs 21,000 Management seats - Rs 50,000 Rs 40,000 per annum Rs 47,590 For non-Karnataka - Rs 75,590 Rs 37,100 Management seats - Rs 30,000 Merit students - Rs 25,000 Rs 45,000 per annum 149. The expression \"capitation fee\" does not have any fixed meaning. The legislatures of some of the States, however, have defined capitation fee. We may notice that in the Tamil Nadu Educational Institutions (Prohibition of Collection of Capitation Fee) Act, 1992, capitation fee has been defined d as: \"capitation fee means any amount by whatever name called, paid or collected directly or indirectly in excess of the fee prescribed under Section 4·\" ' 150. Section 4 of the said Act states that any amount collected in excess of the fee so prescribed is prohibited in the following terms: e \"Regulation of Jee etc.-(l) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the Government, may by notification, regulate the tuition fee or any other fee or deposit that may be received or collected by any educational institution or class or classes of such educational institutions in respect of any or all class or classes of students: Provided that before issuing a notification under this sub-section, the f draft of which shall be published, in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette stating that any objection or suggestion which may be received by the Government, within such period as may be specified therein, shall be considered by them. g h (2) No educational institution shall receive or collect any fee or accept deposit in excess of the amount notified under sub-section ( 1 ). (3) Every educational institution shall issue an official receipt for the fee or deposit received or collected by it.\" 151.

It is true, as has been contended by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicants, that the Central Government in answer to the question raised in Parliament a has stated that the expenses incurred by the State for imparting education to the students is very high. It may vary from three lakhs to five lakhs. Some States, however, in their colleges charge about rupees five thousand per year; whereas the unaided institutions demand anything between rupees two lakhs to five lakhs. 153. Some State Governments unfortunately followed suit, hiked fees b and like many private unaided institutions the State of Haryana has also demanded the entire amount of fees for the whole course. 154. The fee structure, thus, in relation to each and every college must be determined separately keeping in view several factors, including facilities available, infrastructure made available, the age of the institution, investment made, future plan for expansion and betterment of the educational standard c etc. The case of each institution in this behalf is required to be considered by an appropriate Committee. For the said purpose, even the books of accounts maintained by the institution may have to be looked into. Whatever is determined by the Committee by way of a fee structure having regard to relevant factors, some of which are enumerated hereinbefore, the management of the institution would not be entitled to charge anything more. d 155. While determining the fee structure, safeguard has to be provided for so that professional institutions do not become auction houses for the purpose of selling seats. Having regard to the statement of law laid down in paragraph 56 of the judgment, it would have been better, if sufficient guidelines could have been provided for. Such a task which is a difficult one has to be left to the Committee. While fixing the fee structure the Committee e shall also take into consideration, inter alia, the salary or remuneration paid to the members of the faculty and other staff, the investment made by them, the infrastructure provided and plan for future development of the institution as also expansion of the educational institution. Future planning or improvement of facilities may be provided for. An institution may want to invest in an expensive device (for medical colleges) or a powerful computer f (for technical college). These factors are also required to be taken care of. The State must evolve a detailed procedure for constitution and smooth functioning of the Committee. 156. While this Court has not laid down any fixed guidelines as regards fee structure, in my opinion, reasonable surplus should ordinarily vary from 6% to 15%, as such surplus would be utilized for expansion of the system g and development of education. 157. The institutions shall charge fee only for one year in accordance with the rules and shall not charge the fees for the entire course. 158.

With a view to ensure that an educational institution is kept within its bounds and does not indulge in profiteering or otherwise exploiting its a students financially, it will be open to the statutory authorities and in their absence by the State to constitute an appropriate body, till appropriate statutory regulations are made in that behalf. 160. The respective institutions, however, for the aforementioned purpose must file an appropriate application before the Committee and place before it all documents and books of accounts in support of its case. b 161. Fees once fixed should not ordinarily be changed for a period of three years, unless there exists an extraordinary reason. The proposed fees, before indication in the prospectus issued for admission, have to be approved by the concerned authority/body set up. For this purpose the application should not be filed later than April of the preceding year of the relevant education session. The authority/body shall take the decision as regards fees c chargeable latest by October of the year concerned, so that it can form part of the prospectus. No institution should charge any fee beyond the amount fixed and the fee charged shall be deposited in a nationalized bank. In other words, no employee or any other person employed by the management shall be entitled to take fees in cash from the students concerned directly. The statutory authority may consider the desirability of framing an appropriate d regulation inter alia to the effect that in the event it is found that the management of a private unaided professional institution has accepted any amount other than the fees prescribed by the Committee, it may have to pay a penalty ten to fifteen times of the amount so collected and in a suitable case it may also lose its recognition or affiliation. 162. However, there cannot be any doubt that before any such order is e passed, the institutions concerned shall be entitled to an opportunity of being heard. For the aforementioned purpose, the State shall set up a machinery to detect cases where amounts in excess of the permitted limit are collected as it is the general experience that students pay a huge amount. 163. However, if for some reason, fees have already been collected for a f longer period the amount so collected shall be kept in a fixed deposit in a nationalized bank against which no loan or advance may be granted so that the interest accrued thereupon may enure to the benefit of the students concerned. Ordinarily, however, the management should insist for a bond from the concerned students. Common entrance test and percentage of seats g 164.

However, paragraphs 58 and 59 also deal with professional institutions although discussions appear under different headings. This, however, would not minimize the importance of the statement of law made a therein. 166. Paragraph 68 does not state that the statement of law made therein, applies only to the minorities, as for the purpose of local needs it refers to different percentages both for minority unaided and non-minority unaided professional colleges. It cannot, therefore, be said that paragraph 68 has to be read in isolation and paragraphs 58 and 59 of the judgment would be b irrelevant for the said purpose. If the said paragraphs are read conjointly, there cannot be any doubt that merit must be at the forefront. For the said purpose professional and higher educational institutions have been clubbed together. 167. A dichotomy has arisen in view of the findings of the Bench occurring in paragraphs 58 and 59 on the one hand, and 68 of the judgment c on the other. Paragraph 68 refers to private unaided professional colleges which would include both minority and non-minority as would appear from the following: (SCC p. 549) \"The prescription of percentage for this purpose has to be done by the Government according to the local needs and different percentages d can be fixed for minority unaided and non-minority unaided and professional colleges.\" (emphasis supplied) 168. Paragraph 58 clearly states that the merit must play an important role. In no uncertain terms, it is directed: (SCC p. 546) \"[W]hile seeking admission to a professional institution and to become a competent professional, it is necessary that meritorious e candidates are not unfairly treated or put at a disadvantage by preferences shown to less meritorious but more influential applicants. Excellence in professional education would require that greater emphasis be laid on the merit of a student seeking admission. Appropriate regulations for this purpose may be made keeping in view the other observations made in this judgment in the context of admissions to unaided institutions.\" f (emphasis supplied) 169. It, therefore, takes into its fold inter se merit between minority and non-minority students. 170. Paragraph 59 contains an illustration as to how the merit is usually determined. It may be true that paragraph 59 being illustrative in nature, other options at the hands of the minority institutions are not excluded but a g confusion has certainly crept in as therein both minority and non-minority have been clubbed together. 171. Paragraph 59 deals with how to determine the merit by giving illustration. Thus, it does not rule out any other method for determining the merit which may also include marks obtained in qualifying examination. Paragraphs 58, 59 and 68, in my opinion, must be allowed to be given effect h to and read conjointly for the said purpose. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Paragraph 68 should be read in five parts: (1) A difference is sought to be made as regards rules and regulations applicable to the aided institutions vis-a-vis unaided professional institutions. (This shows that the regulations relating to admission of students shall be less rigid for unaided institutions as compared to aided institutions.) (2) While conceding autonomy to the unaided professional institutions (both minority and non-minority), it is mandatory that the principle of merit cannot be foregone or discarded. (This shows that the role played by merit must be given due importance.) (3) The conditions may be laid down by the University or the other statutory bodies entitled to grant recognition to provide for merit-based selection. (The same, however, in my opinion, would not mean that no conditions other than those imposed at the time of grant of recognition can be imposed by way of legislation or otherwise inasmuch as the field of imparting education in professional institutions is governed by statutes. To the said extent, it has to be read down.) (4) The management of private unaided professional colleges for the purpose of admitting students will have options: (a) to hold a common entrance test by itself; or (b) to follow the common entrance test held by the State or the University. The students belonging to the management quota may be admitted having regard to the common entrance test either held by the management or by the State/University, although the test may be common. So far as students belonging to the poorer or backward section of society are concerned, their seats will have to be filled up on the basis of counselling by the State agency. (As would appear from the discussions made hereinafter, it cannot be taken to its logical conclusion.) (5) The percentage of management quota and the rest is required to be prescribed having regard to the local needs. (However, the percentage for minority unaided and non-minority unaided institutions may be different.) 173. It is not correct to say that only because two different expressions \"certain\" and \"different\" have been mentioned at two places in paragraph 68, they connote two different meanings. They will have to be read in the context in which they have been used. As a logical corollary, it will also be incorrect to say that minority unaided institutions can fill up all the seats from amongst the students belonging to their community whereas the non-minority unaided institutions will have no such right. The very fact that different percentages are to be fixed up for minority unaided and non-minority unaided institutions is itself a clear pointer to show that although different percentages may be prescribed therefor; but both minority unaided and non-minority institutions can admit the students of their choice to the extent of the percentage so prescribed, albeit without giving a go-by to the merit criterion. 174. Thus, reservation can be made out of the candidates who have been found to be meritorious on the above basis.

The balance of the seats can then be made available to students who belong to the a non-minority community including poorer or backward section of society as mentioned in paragraph 68 of the judgment. This will not only take care of admission with regard to meritorious candidates including minority candidates for whom a reservation is made but also for other students as for the local needs of the State. 175. If it is to be held that in a case of minority institution all the seats b could be filled in by members of their community/language, if available, the same would run counter to paragraph 68 of the judgment which says about certain percentage which can never be 100%. The expression \"different percentages\" occurring in paragraph 68 would clearly mean there cannot be any fixed percentage. In a given case it may be more than 90% but in another it may be less than 50%. Different percentages must be worked out in terms c of the need of the institution. It has nothing to do with minority or non- minority; aided or unaided. 176. The dictum of the Court in St. Stephen2 vis-a-vis T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 must be read in that context. It cannot be said as a matter of legal proposition that in each and every case the minority educational institutions would be entitled to fill up more than 50% of the seats from d amongst the students of their choice and that too irrespective of merit. The fact that even students belonging to the minority community take admission in colleges run or aided by the State or other private unaided colleges cannot be lost sight of. On taking into consideration all the relevant criteria only the percentage can be worked out. It would be, in my considered opinion, wrong to compare the unaided institutions always with aided institutions. St. e Stephen2 should be understood in proper perspective. What is explained in T.M.A. Pail 1 is that there cannot be any fixed percentage. Each case will have to be considered on its own merit. Need of the institution should be the prime concern. Percentage will have to be worked out having regard to the need only. 177. For the purpose of achieving excellence in a professional institution, f merit indisputably should be a relevant criterion. Merit, as has been noticed in the judgment, may be determined in various ways (paragraph 59). There cannot be, however, any foolproof method whereby and whereunder the merit of a student for all times to come may be judged. Only, however, because a student may fare differently in a different situation and at different point of time by itself cannot be a ground to adopt different standards for g judging his merit at different points of time. Merit for any purpose and in particular, for the purpose of admission in a professional college should be judged as far as possible on the basis of same or similar examination. In other words, inter se merit amongst the students similarly situated should be h 2 (1992) 1 sec 558 1 T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

Different types of examinations, different sets of questions, different ways of evaluating the answer-books may yield different results in the case of the same student. 178. Selection of students, however, by the minority institutions even for the members of their community cannot be bereft of merit. Only in a given situation less meritorious candidates from the minority community can be admitted vis-a-vis the general category; but therefor the modality has to be worked out. For the said purpose de facto equality doctrine may be applied instead of de jure equality as every kind of discrimination may not be violative of the equality clause. [See Pradeep Jain (Dr) v. Union of India29 .] 179. It may be true that some self-financed professional institutions have been permitted to hold their own examination so as to enable the management to fill up their seats from its own quota, as fixed by the State Government. Although no complaint has yet been received by the respective Governments, it may be possible that the time was not ripe for it. As and when complaints are received with regard to holding of an impartial and transparent test, the same has to be examined by the State/University. We may, however, place on record that the State of Maharashtra has placed before us a chart showing that some of the students had appeared at two examinations and one who got only 8% in the common entrance test held by the State, passed the examination held by the management. From the above chart supplied to us by the State of Maharashtra, it appears that only three students who had appeared both at the common entrance test held by the State and the management had passed the common entrance test held by the State whereas a large number of students had passed the test held by the management, although they could not pass the common entrance test. The merit of the students whether belonging to the minority community or otherwise, thus, may be required to be placed on a more rigid test. 180. While considering this question, we may not also lose sight of the fact that a student who aspires to take admission in a professional college keeping in view the extent of competition he has to face, would like to appear in as many examinations as possible. For the said purpose he or she may not choose only one State. Even in a State like Karnataka, as has been noticed in T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 a large number of private institutions exist. But, if they are permitted to hold their own examinations, not only the students will have to purchase different admission forms, which as noticed hereinbefore, may cost between Rs 500 and Rs 1000 but they may be asked to appear in examinations at various places on the same day or on the next day and having regard to the distance, the transport facilities and other factors, he may not be able to appear therein. Travelling from place to place for the purpose of appearance at the examinations in quick succession would also entail a huge expenditure. It may also be difficult to direct that such examinations be held with sufficient time gap. The fact remains that in terms of this judgment each 29 (1984) 3 sec 654 1 T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

We are also not oblivious of the fact that allegations have been made that some institutions even may not sell an admission form unless they are assured of a hefty sum at a the time of admission. It may be true that the States like Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil N adu have permitted the minority institutions to conduct their own examinations for the purpose of admitting the students of their choice. Some institutions have pointed out that they have been holding such examinations for a long long time on all-India basis and fairness and transparency of such examinations have never been questioned by any State or the statutory b authorities. We do not intend to go into the correctness or otherwise of the said plea. However, their cases may be considered separately by the appropriate body if any occasion arises therefor. While granting the right to determine the suitability of a candidate on the basis of marks obtained in the qualifying examination or on the basis of their own examination, or an examination conducted by the State, merit cannot be sacrificed. Some c mechanism as far as practicable must be found out also for the purpose of judging the inter se merit. 181. Furthermore, answers to Questions 5(a) and (c), would go to show that the minority unaided institutions have a right to evolve their own machinery for admitting the students on the basis of merit subject of course to passing the fairness and transparency test. Even for non-minority d professional institutions such a right has been recognized. There is no mechanism which would ensure fairness or transparency of the examination held by each and every unaided professional institution. A suggestion has been mooted out that associations/federations of private institutions have been formed. It may, thus, be possible to protect the right of the minority if such associations/federations take a decision in this behalf in consultation e with the statutory authorities or the concerned State as regards holding of a common entrance test for the said purpose. 182. We may notice that Mr R.N. Trivedi, learned Additional Solicitor General has submitted that the Central Government may hold such all-India examinations but there are practical difficulties in this behalf, as has been rightly pointed out by Mr Venugopal. The need of each State must be judged f separately. A number of students may like to take a chance of taking admission in more than one State. Unless a proper mechanism and requisite infrastructure therefor is created, as at present advised, it may not be possible for the Central Government to hold any examination on an all-India basis. There is another aspect of the matter which cannot be lost sight of. There must be an agency which would have to determine the equivalence of several g examinations. Many Universities have adopted such a mechanism. The standard of education varies from State to State or University to University or Board to Board. In such a situation, equivalence of degrees must be considered for the said purpose by an appropriate authority. 183.

It goes without saying that having regard to the number of institutions vis-a-vis number of candidates with reference to the local needs, it will be open to the State/University to fix higher cut-off marks than prescribed by the Medical Council of India or the All India Council for Technical Education. So far as the common entrance test proposed to be held by the federation/association of private unaided professional institutions is concerned, the modalities and the detailed procedure therefor must be worked out so that it may not cause any undue inconvenience to either the students or the institution(s). By way of an example, we may state that if a common entrance test is held under the auspices of the federation/association, it must clearly spell out that those who belong to the minority community, whether based on religion or language, shall be admitted only in the institutions run by such community and not in the institutions run by the other community at the first instance. Only in the event the seats remain unfilled, they would clearly be filled up by the students belonging to the general category including those who do not belong to that particular community running the institution. Similarly, the mode and manner in which the expenses are to be incurred for holding the examinations, the apportionment thereof as well as the disbursement of the amount earned by way of selling the admission forms etc. have to be worked out by the Committee. 185. The minority institutions imparting professional courses may have a legal or constitutional right to hold their own examination; but a serious consideration is required to be bestowed as to whether for the purpose of judging merit they should opt for the common entrance test held by the State. Such a course, if resorted to, would not only be helpful for determining the inter se merit between the students/candidates but also would be sufficient to be indicative of the fact how and to what extent the students belonging to minorities lag behind the majority so that special efforts can be made to bring their standard up to the national level. 186. The quota of seats to be filled up by the State Government for the poor or weaker sections of society may be fixed on the basis of the entrance test held by the concerned State Government or the University. Economic disability of a meritorious student should come to the forefront for determining the criteria as regards poor or weaker sections of the society. 187. There cannot, however, be any gainsaying that the appropriate statutory authority on a deeper consideration of the matter may prescribe a suitable method for the purpose of determining the merit as also the fair and transparent manner in which such examinations can be conducted.

Furthermore, any institution if it thinks proper and expedient, may file an application for grant of exemption so as to enable it to hold its own examination. An application in this behalf should be filed by the end of April of the previous year in which such examination is sought to be held. The aforementioned body would pass an appropriate order within three months b from the date of receipt of such representation upon giving an opportunity of hearing and placing of material in support of its stand, to the institution concerned. 189. Several States like the States of Tamil Nadu, Kamataka and Kerala have permitted the educational institutions to hold their own examination for the purpose of admitting students within their quota. Some of the States like c Maharashtra and Gujarat insist on admitting the students through a common entrance test. The following chart gives a glimpse as to how different States understood the judgment of this Court differently: State Andhra Pradesh Delhi Gujarat Haryana Karnataka Kerala Orissa TarnilNadu Uttar Pradesh Chhattisgarh Maharashtra Admissions Govt. 85% 95% 85% 15%AIEEE 70% CEET 2003 75% 50% 85% 50% 85% 60% 85% Management 15% 15% max 15% 15% 25% 50% 15% 50% 15% 40% d e 15% (These seats must f also be filled from the State common entrance test list) 190.

However, all such students must be admitted only on merit. In the event, some seats remain vacant, they must be filled by general category students g strictly on merit. 191. As noticed hereinbefore, different States and different High Courts have laid down different percentages of seats for the management and the State.

The need of the minority community may have a nexus with the population belonging to that community in that State. It will further depend upon various other relevant factors. By way of example, we may say that in a State where the percentage of a particular religion may be 30 or 35, the minority institution established by members of that religion may have a higher stake than the members of the community professing a religion but the population of which is negligible. Similar may be the case with minority institutions based on language. 192. The percentage of seats will also depend upon the need of the community in a particular State as also the need of the institution itself. The nature of the professional course would also have relevance. All these factors must be taken into consideration by the appropriate committee or body so long a statutory regulation is not framed in this behalf. 193. Furthermore, the need of the community vis-a-vis the local needs must be judged upon taking into consideration the relevant factors and ignoring irrelevant ones. In terms of paragraph 68 of the judgment, local need would be a relevant factor for the purpose of determining the percentage of students who would be admitted on non-minority quota. Local needs, if it is compelling State interest, will have a primacy over the need of the minority community and in that view of the matter, it would not be correct to lay down a proposition of law that the need of that community in the State would be paramount. Each case, thus, has to be considered on its own merit and no hard-and-fast rule can be laid down therefor. 194. For the aforementioned purpose also, a machinery should be evolved in the respective States, the decision of which shall be final and binding. 195. However, there may not be any permanent Committee functioning as a tribunal. Such a body, if any, must be created under a statute. A Tribunal with an adjudicatory power should not be directed to be created by this Court in exercise of its power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. This direction is only interim in nature and is being issued in the interest of all concerned. It is, therefore, clarified that the body created in terms of this judgment would function only so long a statutory body, if any, does not come into being by reason of a statute or statutory rules. The legislature or the rule-making authority may, however, lay down the procedure for proper functioning thereof. Merit 196.

Thirdly, to ensure high standard of education and for that purpose to ensure admission to the most eligible candidates, requiring merit in a poor country like ours, the tuition and other fees should be within the reach of common people. b 199. So far as minority institutions are concerned, the merit criterion would have to be judged like a pyramid. At the kindergarten, primary, secondary levels, minorities may have 100% quota. At this level the merit may not have much relevance at all but at the level of higher education and in particular, professional education and postgraduate-level education, merit indisputably should be a relevant criterion. At the postgraduation level, where c there may be a few seats, the minority institutions may not have much say in the matter. Services of doctors, engineers and other professionals coming out from the institutions of professional excellence must be made available to the entire country and not to any particular class or group of people.

This aspect of the matter may also be considered from the human rights angle. 201. Rights of minorities, on the one hand, and rights of persons to have higher education and right of development should be so construed so as to enable the court to give effect thereto. 202. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 provides for 27 e rights. Right of Education is also one of the human rights. Article 26 reads thus: \"(J) Everyone has the right to education.

Apart from the aforementioned rights, right to development is also a human right. \"Development\" connotes an ongoing process. An economic prosperity or elimination of poverty is not the only goal to be achieved but along with it it allows individuals to lead a life with dignity with a view to participate in the governmental process so as to enable them to preserve their identity and culture. 205. We may refer to the UN Declaration on the Right to Development, 1986. The Declaration describes development as a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process, which aims at constant improvement of the well being of people and of individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in the process. 206. In the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, the State parties agree [Article 5(c)] that \"it is essential to recognize the right of members of national minorities to carry on their own educational activities, including the maintenance of schools and, depending on the educational policy of each State, the use or the teaching of their own language,\" and set out the circumstances in which this right may be exercised. The European Convention on Human Rights contains a provision (Article 14) in which \"association with a national minority\" is listed among a series of grounds upon which discrimination is prohibited. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966, includes an article on the rights of persons belonging to minorities which reads: \"Article 2 7 In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minont1es exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language.\" 207. Among the decisions of the principal organs of the United Nations which have dealt with the question of special protective measures for ethnic, religious, or linguistic groups are three resolutions of the General Assembly: (1) on the future Government of Palestine, (2) on the question of the disposal of the former Italian colonies, and (3) on the question of Eritrea.

From the texts of the instruments and decisions mentioned above, it a may be inferred that the term \"minority\" is applied internationally to two distinct categories of persons: (a) minorities whose members desire equality with the dominant groups in the sole sense of non-discrimination, and (b) those whose members desire equality with the dominant groups in the sense of non-discrimination and the recognition of certain special rights and the rendering of certain positive services. The kind of \"minority rights\" that they b feel they are entitled to claim if their equality within the State is to be real includes one or more of the following: (a) provision of adequate primary and secondary education for the minority in its own language and its cultural traditions; (b) provision for maintenance of the culture of the minority through the establishment and operation of schools, libraries, museums, media of c information, and other cultural and educational institutions; (c) provision of adequate facilities to the minority for the use of its language, either orally or in writing, in the legislature, before the courts, and in administration, and the granting of the right to use that language in private intercourse; (cl) provision for respect of the family law and personal status of the minority and their religious practices and interests; and (e) provision of a certain degree of autonomy. d 209. Several areas are sought to be secured wherefor the struggle continues. The gap between the developed and the developing countries is a yawning one. Whereas there has been a rapid economic growth in a few e countries bringing millions of people out of poverty, narrowing the gap between haves and have-nots, a large number of countries have seen the gap grow and poverty increase. Development and the eradication of poverty vis- a-vis human rights must be seen in that perspective. 210. The right to establish professional colleges both by minorities and non-minorities has been found in Article 19(l)(g) as also Article 30 of the f Constitution of India. These rights vis-a-vis restrictions and limitations thereupon should be construed not only from an economic point of view but also having regard to the International Treaties, Declarations and Conventions on Human Rights. The right of a minority is a human right so also the right of development. Thus, subject to reasonable restrictions, any unaided institution imparting professional courses may although exercise 9 greater autonomy in the matter of management and determination of the fee structure, it will have a limited right so far as the right to admit students is concerned.

In order to compete with the other developed countries, GDP of India should be around 15% instead of the present rate of 5%. This can be achieved only by producing students of excellence, which can be achieved only by encouraging institutions of excellence imparting professional education to those who are meritorious. Giving encouragement to the students having better merit will, thus, have a direct nexus with the economic and consequently, the national interests of the country. The right of development from the human rights point of view must be construed liberally. When there are two competing human rights, namely, human rights for the religious minorities and the human rights for development, having regard to the economic and national interests of the country in the matter of admission of students, the latter should be allowed to prevail subject to protection of the basic minority rights. The State may have to strike a delicate balance between these two competing rights. Furthermore, the right to admit students may vary from course to course, discipline to discipline. At the stage of postgraduate level, there may be only one seat or two seats, and, thus, in such a situation the right of the minority institutions to admit a student may be less than in the case of a non-professional course. 211. \"Proper education\", Nani Palkhivala said, \"should lead to civilization\". Recently, in Kapila Hingorani v. State of Bihar30 a Bench of this Court noticed (SCC p. 28, paragraph 55) the following observations of Field, J. in Munn v. Illinois31 as to what is \"life\", which was in the following terms: \"[S]omething more than mere animal existence and the inhibition against the deprivation of life extends to all those limits and faculties by which life is enjoyed.\" Therein it was noticed: (SCC p. 32, paragraph 62) \"62. The right to development in the developing countries is itself a human right. The same has been made a part of WTO and GATT. In The World Trade Organization, Law, Practice, and Policy (Oxford) by Matusushita Schoenbaum and Mauroidis at p. 389, it is stated: 'The United Nations has proclaimed the existence of a human right to development. This right refers not only to economic growth but also to human welfare, including health, education, employment, social security, and a wide range of other human needs. This human right to development is vaguely defined as a so-called third-generation human right that cannot be implemented in the same way as civil and political human rights. Rather, it is the obligation of States and intergovernmental organizations to work within the scope of their authority to combat poverty and misery in disadvantaged countries.'\" (emphasis supplied) 30 c2003) 6 sec 1 : JT c2003) s sc 1 31 94 US 113: 24 L Ed 77 (1877) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Having regard to globalisation and opening up of the market, the State expects various medical colleges and educational institutions and a Universities to move in. Under WTO and GATT human development has taken its firm root. A decent life to the persons living in the society in general is perceived. 214. In the said scenario this Court in Kapila Hingorani30 observed: (SCC p. 34, paragraph 71) \"71. The States of India are welfare States. They having regard to the b constitutional provisions adumbrated in the Constitution of India and in particular Part IV thereof laying down the directive principles of State policy and Part IV-A laying down the fundamental duties are bound to preserve the practice to maintain the human dignity.\" 215. To achieve this, the promotion of human development and the C preservation and protection of human rights proceed from a common platform. Both reflect the commitment of the people to promote freedom, the well-being and dignity of individuals in the society. Human development as a human right has a direct nexus with the increase in capabilities of human beings as also the range of things they can do. Human development is eventually in the interest of society and on a larger canvas, it is in the national d interest also. As a human right, human development finds its echo in several areas as, for example, in excellence in professional education, be it the study of Medicine, Engineering or Law. Progress and development in these fields will not only give a boost to the economy of the country but also result in better living conditions for the people of India. 216. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation case1 this Court called upon the private e unaided institutions including the minority educational institutions to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the meritorious students and in particular the meritorious socially and educationally backward students. Higher education as contained in Article 26 must be based on merit. The competing human rights of the minorities vis-a-vis any other citizen, thus, require a delicate balance. 217. Furthermore, Article 51-A(j) enjoins a duty on every citizen of India inter alia to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of excellence and achievement. f 218. In T.M.A Pai Foundation 1 this Court in no uncertain terms said that merit would be the first criterion for imparting professional education. It g must be given full effect with the aid of these additional reasons. Recognition/affiliation 219. Although the minorities have a right to establish institutions of their own choice, they admittedly, do not have any right of recognition or affiliation for the said purpose. They must fulfil the requirements of law as 30 c2003) 6 sec 1 : JT (2003) s sc 1 l T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

In T.M.A. Pai Foundation 1 it was laid down that certain conditions can be imposed as regards admission of students and mode of holding examinations at the time of grant of recognition. A question has been raised by Mr Nariman that once recognition has been granted, no further restriction can be imposed. We do not agree. There exist some institutions in this country which are more than a century old. It would be too much to say that b only because an institution receives recognition/affiliation at a distant point of time the appropriate Government is denuded of its power to lay down any law in imposing any fresh condition despite the need of change owing to passage of time. Furthermore, Parliament or the State Legislatures are not denuded of their power having regard to restrictions that may satisfy the test of clause (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution of India or regulations in terms c of Article 30 depending upon the national interest/public interest and other relevant factors. We, however, wish to emphasise that the State/University while granting recognition or the affiliation cannot impose any condition in furtherance of its own needs or in pursuit of the directive principles of State policy. An epilogue d 221. It is unfortunate that a Constitution Bench had to be constituted for interpreting a eleven-Judge Bench judgment. Probably, in judicial history of India, this has been done for the first time. It is equally unfortunate that all of us cannot agree on all the points, despite the fact that the matter involves construction of a judgment. In the name of interpretation we have to some extent, however little it may be rewritten the judgment. We have laid down e new laws and issued directions purported to be in terms of Article 142 of the Constitution. We have interpreted T.M.A. Pai1, but we have also made endeavours to give effect to it. In some areas it was possible, in some other, it was not. f g h 222. We have refrained ourselves from expressing any opinion at this stage as to whether grant of settlement of government land at a throwaway price or allowing the private institutions to avail the facilities of government hospitals would amount to grant-of-aid or not. We have also not expressed any opinion on cross-subsidy. 223. The superior courts in India exist for interpretation of the Constitution or interpretation of statutes. They cannot evolve a foolproof system on the basis of affidavits filed by the parties or upon hearing their counsel. Certain details of vexing problems on the basis of the interpretation given by this Court must be undertaken by the statutory bodies which have the requisite expertise. It is expected that statutory bodies would be able to perform their duties for which they have been established. The doors of the Court should not be knocked every time, if a problem arises in implementation of the judgment, however slight it may be. The Court has its 1 T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

The problems which can be sorted at the ground level by holding consultations should not be allowed to be brought to the Court. It is, in that view of the matter, we have thought it fit to direct setting up of a committees for the aforementioned purposes. 224. In the present constitutional set-up, having regard to Entry 66 List I of the Constitution of India, the legislative power of the State may be very limited; the extent whereof may have to be determined in appropriate cases. But the stake of the State in such matters is also not minimal. The State has to evolve its own policies generating the source of employment. b 225. We have come across several schemes framed by the States in terms whereof incentives are being given to the private industries for generating employment or reduction in taxes is being proposed if graduates are employed. The respective States, therefore, must apply their mind while granting essentiality certificate inasmuch as the human resource development C problems will have to be faced by them. In evolving a sound policy decision in this behalf, the statutory bodies shall also have to lend their ears to the respective State Governments while granting permission for establishment of the professional educational institutions. The Human Resource Development Ministry of the Central Government should also play its role. 226. The IAs for clarification are, thus, disposed of.
