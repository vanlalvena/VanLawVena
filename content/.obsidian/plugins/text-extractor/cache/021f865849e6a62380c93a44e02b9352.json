The SEBI Act, as the object of its enactment would indicate, was enacted \"to provide for the establishment of a Board to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate, the securities market and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto\". 3. For the purposes of the present reference, we may proceed to consider the provisions contained in Chapter VI-A of the SEBI Act. Sections 15-A to 15-HA are the penalty provisions whereas Section 15-1 deals with the power of adjudication and Section 15-J enumerates the ''factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer\" while adjudging the quantum of penalty. 4.

Explanation.-for the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power of an adjudicating officer to adjudge the quantum of penalty under Sections 15-A to 15-E, clauses (b) and (c) of Sections 15-F, 15-G, 15-H and 15-HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.\" [Explanation added by Act 7 of 2017] S.

We must avoid conflict and head-on-clash and construe the said provisions harmoniously. Provision of one section cannot be used to nullify and obtrude another unless it is impossible to reconcile the two provisions. The Explanation to Section 15-J of the SEBI Act added by Act 7 of 2017, quoted above, has clarified and vested in the adjudicating officer a discretion under Section 15-J on the quantum of penalty to be imposed while adjudicating defaults under Sections 15-A to 15-HA. Explanation to Section 15-J was introduced/added in 2017 for the removal of doubts created as a result of pronouncement in Roofit Industries Ltd. case2 . We are in agreement with the reasoning given in reference order dated 14-3-2016 1 that Roofit Industries Ltd. 2 had erroneously and wrongly held that Section 15-J would not be applicable after Section 15-A(a) was amended with effect from 29-10-2002 till 7-9-2014 when Section 15-A(a) of the SEBI Act was again amended. It is beyond any doubt that the second referred question stands fully answered by clarification through the medium of enacting the Explanation to Section 15-J vide Act 7 of 2017, which also states that the adjudicating officer shall always be deemed to have exercised and applied the provision. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to hold that the provisions of Section 15-J were never eclipsed and had continued to apply in terms thereof to the defaults under Section 15-A(a) of the SEBI Act. 6. Reference order in Siddharth Chaturvedi 1 on the said aspect has observed that Section 15-A(a) could apply even to technical defaults of small amounts and, therefore, prescription of minimum mandatory penalty of Rs 1 lakh per day subject to maximum of Rs 1 crore, would make the section completely disproportionate and arbitrary so as to invade and violate fundamental rights. Insertion of the Explanation would reflect that the legislative intent, in spite of the use of the expression \"whichever is less\" in Section 15-A(a) as it existed during the period 29-10-2002 till 7-9-2014, was not to curtail the discretion of the adjudicating officer by prescribing a minimum mandatory penalty of not less than Rs 1 lakh per day till compliance was made, notwithstanding the fact that the default was technical, no loss was caused to the investor(s) and no disproportionate gain or unfair advantage was made. The legislative intent is also clear as Section 15-A(a) was amended by Amendment Act 27 of 2014 to state that the penalty could extend to Rs 1 lakh for each day during which the failure continues subject to a maximum penalty of Rs 1 crore. This amendment in 2014 was not retrospective and therefore, clarificatory and for removal of doubt Explanation to Section 15-J was added by Act 7 of 2017. Normally the expression \"whichever is less\" would connote absence of discretion by prescribing the minimum mandatory penalty, but in the context of Section 15-A(a) as it was between 29-10-2002 till 7-9-2014, read along with Explanation to Section 15-J added by Act 7 of 2017, we would hold that the legislative intent was not to prescribe minimum mandatory penalty of Rs l lakh per day during which the default and failure had continued.

This will require us to consider the first question referred. Having dealt with the submissions advanced by the rival parties, (both parties have actually canvassed for a wider and more expansive interpretation of Section 15-J), we b are inclined to take the view that the provisions of clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15-J are illustrative in nature and have to be taken into account whenever such circumstances exist. But this is not to say that there can be no other circumstance(s) beyond those enumerated in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15-J that the adjudicating officer is precluded in law from considering while deciding on the quantum of penalty to be imposed. c 8. A narrow view would be in direct conflict with the provisions of Section 15-1(2) of the SEBI Act which vests jurisdiction in the adjudicating officer, who is empowered on completion of the inquiry to impose \"such penalty as he thinks fit in accordance with the provisions of any of those sections\". 9. The above apart, the circumstances enumerated in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15-J of the SEBI Act may have no relevance and may never arise in case of contraventions contemplated by certain provisions of the SEBI Act, for instance Sections 15-A, 15-B or 15-C of the SEBI Act. Failure to furnish information, return, etc.; failure to enter into agreement with clients; and failure to redress investors' grievances cannot give rise to the circumstances set out in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15-J. 10. Therefore, to understand the conditions stipulated in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15-J to be exhaustive and admitting of no exception or vesting any discretion in the adjudicating officer would be virtually to admit/concede that in adjudications involving penalties under Sections 15-A, 15-B and 15-C, Section 15-J will have no application. Such a result could not have been intended by the legislature. We, therefore, hold and take the view that conditions stipulated in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15-J are not exhaustive and in the given facts of a case, there can be circumstances beyond those enumerated by clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 15-J which can be taken note of by the adjudicating officer while determining the quantum of penalty. 11. At this stage, we must also deal with and reject the argument raised by some of the private appellants that the conditions stipulated in clauses (a) to (c) of Section 15-J are mandatory conditions which must be read into Sections 15-A to 15-HA in the sense that unless the conditions specified in clauses (a) to (c) are satisfied, penalty cannot be imposed by the adjudicating officer under the substantive provisions of Sections 15-A to 15-HA of the SEBI Act. The argument is too far-fetched to be accepted. Section 15-J of the SEBI Act enumerates by way of illustration(s) the factors which the adjudicating officer should take into consideration for determining the quantum of penalty imposable.

There is a distinction between a continuing offence and a repeat offence. The continuing offence is one which is of a continuous nature as distinguished from one which is committed once and for all. The term \"continuing offence\" was explained and elucidated by giving several illustrations in State of Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi 3. In case of continuing offence, the liability continues until the rule or its requirement is obeyed or complied with. On every occasion b when disobedience or non-compliance occurs and reoccurs, there is an offence committed. Continuing offence constitutes a fresh offence every time or occasion it occurs. In Union of India v. Tarsem Singh 4 , continuing offence or default in service law was explained as a single wrongful act which causes a continuing injury. A recurring or successive wrong, on the other hand, are those which occur periodically with each wrong giving rise to a distinct and c separate cause of action. We have made reference to this legal position in view of clause (c) of Section 15-J of the SEBI Act which refers to repetitive nature of default and not a continuing default. The word \"repetitive\" as used therein would refer to a recurring or successive default. This factum has to be taken into consideration while deciding upon the quantum of penalty. This dictum, however, does not mean that factum of continuing default is not a relevant d factor, as we have held that clauses (a) to (c) in Section 15-J of the SEBI Act are merely illustrative and are not the only grounds/factors which can be taken into consideration while determining the quantum of penalty. e f g 13. We now proceed to consider each of the case as, in our considered view, such exercise would be appropriate to finally terminate/decide the appeals under consideration.

The share price of the scrips during the period 1-12-2005 to 11-1-2006 was in the range of Rs 31.50 to Rs 49.90 with an average daily volume of 8255 shares. b 16.4. The three appellants along with Neeraj Sanghvi, during the period c 10-4-2006 to 8-9-2006 had traded with each other in 18,48,081 shares of the GPL which had accounted for around 16.29% of the total traded volume in this period. 16.S. About 45% of the total shares i.e. 8,34,453 shares were executed via structured orders i.e. buy and sell orders which were placed within a gap of one minute. Out of this, trade in 5,97,835 shares (32% of the total shares traded) were through synchronised orders as the rate and quantity of the buy and sell order were identical. 16.6. On 64 trading dates between 10-4-2006 to 8-9-2006, a reverse trading pattern was espied in 15,18,204 shares, which had accounted for 13.38% of d the total market value and was more than 20% of the market volume in the e aforesaid period. 16.7. On 24 days between the period from 10-4-2006 to 8-9-2006, the quantity traded in the GPL scrips between the connected persons was more than 50% of the market volume. 16.8. On 1-8-2006, the connected transactions were 83.79% of the market f volume. 16.9.

C d e f g h 16.15. Similarly, there were 13 buy and sell trades with N eeraj Sanghvi. 17. The sole contention of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of Bhavesh Pabari and Mis Shree Radhe is that penalties of Rs 20,00,000 (Rupees twenty lakhs only) each should not have been separately imposed on Bhavesh Pabari and Mis Shree Radhe, of which he was the sole proprietor. 18. This contention superficially seems attractive, but on an in-depth reflection should be rejected as Bhavesh Pabari had indulged in trading in its personal name and as also the sole proprietor of Mis Shree Radhe. This is clear from inter se transactions and transactions with connected persons. Thus, Bhavesh Pabari had transacted in two different capacities i.e. in his personal name and as sole proprietor of Mis Shree Radhe. It is in this background that total penalty ofRs 40 lakhs (Rupees forty lakhs only) under Section 15-HA of the SEBI Act had been imposed for violation of Regulations 4(2)(a), (b) and (g) of the PFUTP Regulations as the transactions were in two different names, though belonging to the same individual. 19. Accordingly, CA No. 9798 of 2014 preferred by Mis Shree Radhe and CA No. 9797 of 2014 preferred by Bhavesh Pabari hold no merit and are dismissed affirming the order5 passed by the Appellate Tribunal and confirming the penalty of Rs 20,00,000 (Rupees twenty lakhs only) each imposed under Section 15-HA of the Act. CA No. 9799 of 2014 by Hemant Sheth must also fail. In the given facts, we are not inclined to show indulgence and leniency to the three appellants, as the facts found are highly ignominious and scandalous. CA No. 11311 of 2013 (SEBI v.

The relevant portion of the impugned order5 passed by the Appellate Tribunal reads: \"Additional challenge in Appeals Nos. 71 of 2012 and 72 of 2012, relates to imposition of Rs 10 lakhs penalty upon each appellant for violating Sections 11-C(3) and 11-C(5) of the SEBI Act. Grievance of the appellants is that failure to furnish requisite information was due to circumstances beyond control viz. grandmother of Bhavesh Pabari (Appellant in Appeal No. 71 of 2012) who is proprietor of Mis Shree Radhe (Appellant in Appeal No. 72 of 2012) had expired during the relevant period and, therefore, he was in disturbed mind at the material time. Though, explanation given does not inspire confidence in the facts of the present case, where penalty of Rs 20 lakhs has already been upheld, in our opinion, it would be just and proper to delete penalty of Rs 10 lakhs imposed upon both the appellants\". 22. Submission of SEBI that the impugned order did not record any reason for deleting the said penalty, in spite of observing that the explanation given by Bhavesh Pabari did not inspire confidence, would be a just and fair criticism and a good challenge. We clearly have reservations on the ground stated or rather lack of reasoning given by the Appellate Tribunal, especially in the light of the language of Section 15-A(a) and Section 15-J of the Act. However, during the hearing, the learned counsel appearing for Bhavesh Pabari had drawn our attention to his reply dated 28-9-2009 stating that Bhavesh Pabari's grandmother had expired and, therefore, he had requested for time to make an appearance. It was stated at the Bar that grandmother of Bhavesh Pabari had expired on 19-9-2009, and this aspect was highlighted and made known to the authorities. Furthermore, Bhavesh Pabari/M/s Shree Radhe had submitted part information vide letter dated 2-11-2009. These aspects and explanations have not been considered by the Appellate Tribunal. 23. The adjudicating officer, while imposing penalty had referred to the letter dated 6-5-2009 by which Bhavesh Pabari and M/s Shree Radhe were required to furnish information of details regarding trading in the GPL scrips, connection/relation with the GPL, its promoters/directors, connection/ relation between Hemant Sheth, etc. but the said notice was not complied with. Thereafter, reminders dated 21-7-2009 and 14-8-2009 were issued, but again to no avail. This was followed by summons dated 4-9-2009, 23-9-2009, 20-10-2009 and 5-11-2009. 24. Given the aforesaid facts, we should have remitted the matter to the Appellate Tribunal for a fresh adjudication and examination but would refrain from doing so in view of the time gap, the quantum of fine imposed, and, as we have upheld the total penalty of Rs 40,00,000 (Rupees forty lakhs only) imposed on the appellant under Section 15-HA of the SEBI Act. We would rather close the proceedings. Accordingly, the appeals preferred by SEBI i.e. CA No. 11311 of2013 and CA No. 1824 of2014 are also disposed of. 5 Hemant Sheth v.

It is accepted and admitted that the appellants Ankur Chaturvedi, Sidharth Chaturvedi and Jay Kishore Chaturvedi having purchased shares of M/s Brij Laxmi Leasing and Finance Co. Ltd. on 2, 3 and 6 occasions respectively, were required but had failed to make necessary disclosures to the stock exchange as stipulated and statutorily mandated by Regulations 13( 4) and 13(4-A) read with Regulation 13(5) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Probation oflnsider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (\"the PIT Regulations\", for short). 27. For the said violations, penalty ofRs 5,00,000 (Rupees five lakhs only) in the case of Ankur Chaturvedi and Sidharth Chaturvedi and Rs 11,00,000 (Rupees eleven lakhs only) in the case of Jay Kishore Chaturvedi were imposed under Section 15-A(b) of the SEBI Act. Ankur Chaturvedi had also suffered penalty of Rs 2,00,000 (Rupees two lakhs only) under Section 15-HB of the SEBI Act as he had sold 45,032 shares after acquiring 45,000 shares on 29-1-2013, which was in violation of Clause 4.2 of the Model Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading for Listed Companies as set out in Schedule I, Part A of the PIT Regulations. 28. The aforesaid penalties were affirmed in the impugned orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal, rejecting the contention that the penalty so imposed was harsh and deserved substantial reduction as there was no intention on the part of the appellants to suppress purchase or sale or that non-disclosure had not caused profits to the appellants or otherwise a loss to the investors and that the failure to make disclosure was an inadvertent error without mala fide intention. 29. The Appellate Tribunal, considering the factual matrix, has held that the maximum penalty stipulated in the PIT Regulations was Rs 1,00,000 (Rupees one lakh only) for each day during which the failure continued or Rs 1,00,00,000 (Rupees one crore only), whichever was less. The penalty imposed by the adjudicating authority took into consideration the mitigating factors and cannot be said to be excessively harsh or unreasonable. 30. In view of the factual background and the reasoning given by the Appellate Tribunal, we do not find any good ground and reason to interfere with the quantum of penalty confirmed by the impugned orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal. 5 Hemant Sheth v.

We have jointly dealt with these two appeals as they both relate to shares of M/s Bhawani Paper Mills Ltd. (\"the target company\", in short). 32. In the first appeal, Akshat Tandon and 14 others are aggrieved by the order dated 5-10-20166 passed by the Appellate Tribunal wherein their appeal against order dated 31-7-2014 passed by the adjudicating officer imposing penalty between Rs 3,00,000 (Rupees three lakhs only) to Rs 6,00,000 (Rupees six lakhs only) for each of the 15 violations of Regulations 3(3) and 3(4) of the Securities and Exchange Board oflndia (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 1997 (\"the SAST Regulations\", for short) was upheld. 33. The appellants were promotors of the target company and together were holding 54% of the paid-up shares of the target company, which were acquired on various dates. The acquisition was in excess of the limits prescribed under Regulations 3(3) and 3(4) of the SAST Regulations. Failure to notify/ submit report to the authorities concerned within the stipulated time in terms of Regulations 3(3) and 3( 4) is accepted. The case of the appellants is predicated on the principle of proportionality, for it is asserted that the quantum of penalty imposed is excessive and unreasonably harsh. Similar contentions were raised before the Appellate Tribunal with the submission that the target company had incurred huge losses and that it was a sick company. Furthermore, there was an absence of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage to the appellants or otherwise a loss to the investors. Contentions were rejected on the ground that the penalty imposed was reasonable and not harsh. To justify the quantum, reference was made to Sections 15-A(a) and (b) of the SEBI Act, which stipulate that the penalty could be Rs 1,00,000 (Rupees one lakh only) for each day during which the violation continued and could be as high as Rs 1,00,00,000 (Rupees one crore only) for each violation. 34. This Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 15-Z of the SEBI Act, cannot go into the proportionality and quantum of the penalty imposed, unless the same is distinctly disproportionate to the nature of the violation which makes it offensive, tyrannous or intolerable. Penalty by the very nature of the provision is penal. We can interfere only where the quantum is wholly arbitrary and harsh which no reasonable man would award. In the instant case, the factual findings are not denied and, thus, we are not inclined to intermeddle with the quantum of penalty. The penalty imposed is just, fair and reasonable and, thus, upheld. 35. The appellants have also contended that in the absence of any prescribed limitation period, SEBI should have issued show-cause notice within a reasonable time and there being a delay of about 8 years in issuance of show-cause notice in 2014, the proceedings should have been dropped. This contention was not raised before the adjudicating officer in the written submissions or the reply furnished. It is not clear whether this contention was argued before the Appellate Tribunal.

What would be reasonable time, would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of the default/ statute, prejudice caused, whether the third-party rights had been created, etc. The show-cause notice in the present case had specifically referred to the respective dates of default and the date of compliance, which was made between 30-8-2011 to 29-11-2011 (delay was between 927 days to 1897 days). Only upon compliance being made that the defaults had come to notice. In the aforesaid background, and so noticing the quantum of fine/penalty imposed, we do not find good ground and reason to interfere. 36. Now coming to the second appeal, Badri Vishal Tandon has in the impugned order dated 20-6-20187 passed by the Appellate Tribunal affirming the order dated 29-12-2017 passed by the adjudicating officer, whereby he has been saddled with penalty of Rs 1,50,000 (Rupees one lakh fifty thousand only) for violation of Regulation 7(1-A) read with Regulation 7(2) of the SAST Regulations. The appellant as Karla of Ram Mohandas Tandon (HUF) was allotted 22,50,000 shares of the target company by way of preferential allotment, which constituted 6.46% of its total share capital. The shares were allotted pursuant to the approval given by the Board of Directors vide letter dated 25-6-2011. The letter of allotment was received by him on 27-6-2011, and 22,50,000 shares of the Target Company were transferred to his demat account on 12-8-2011. 37. The Appellate Tribunal has affirmed the factual findings that there was a delay in disclosure, which was required to be made within two days of the receipt of intimation of allotment of shares, as per Regulations 7(1-A) and 7(2) of the SAST Regulations. The intimation/letter from the Target Company about the said acquisition was received by the Bombay Stock Exchange only on 11-7-2011. 38. Maximum penalty imposable on Badri Vishal Tandon was up to Rs 1,00,00,000 (Rupees one crore only).

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 106 SUPREME COURT CASES (2019) s sec 40. The brief facts are that the appellant was a stockbroker and member of the Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd. The appellant had executed synchronised trades in the aforesaid scrips on behalf of its clients - Mr Ronak Choski, a Mr Shailesh Patel, Ms Nitaben Patel and Ms Kapilaben Patel, acting both as a stockbroker as well as party stockbroker. Total volume of synchronised trade in the scrip of WTIL was 68,02, 131 shares, which were executed on one day. Total volume of 88,89,052 shares in the case of scrip of ADPL were transacted over a period of five days. The appellate order succinctly refers to the figures and details of such transactions, for example, on 19-2-2009, the appellant's b clients had executed 18 trades in the scrip of WTIL, which constituted 68% of the total number of shares traded on that date and 38% of the trades executed on that date. For 7 out of 18 synchronised trades, the buy and sell orders were perfectly matching in price and quantity. Similarly, on 20-3-2009, there were 73 synchronised trades in the scrip of ADPL amounting to 43.8% of the shares traded and 63.4% of the trades executed. The appellate order observes that c such synchronised trades create an artificial volume, leading to ratcheting up in the trading of the scrip and cause price fluctuations, thereby misleading the potential investors. Such transactions create a deceptive appearance as to the quantum of trading in the scrip which could be understood as a viable investment opportunity when it is not. This hurts and damages sanctity of the securities market. Reference was specifically made to the factum that the d synchronised trade on different dates was amounting to 3.4%, 7.17%, 20.4% and 15.12% of the total market volume on 25-3-2009, 23-3-2009, 26-3-2009 and 27-3-2009 respectively. 41. The appellant does not controvert the transactions/trades. The case of the appellant is that the trades were executed within a normal price range and did not lead to an artificial price movement. Reliance was placed on SEBl's e Circular dated 14-9-1999 that cross deals executed between two clients of the same broker can be conducted through the screen mechanism of the stock exchange. Submission was that the synchronised trade was not a result of any illicit scheme. However, the Appellate Tribunal had rejected the contentions as the transactions/trades made by the appellants were between family members restricted to two scrips of WTIL and ADPL spread over a period of 6 days and f had referred to the factual matrix of the case. 42. Reference to SEBI v. Rakhi Trading (P) Ltd. 9 which refers to an earlier decision in SEBI v. Kishore R. Ajmera 10 is misconceived, for the said decisions do not hold that a broker cannot be proceeded against for violation of Regulation 7 of the SEBI (Stockbrokers and Sub-Brokers) Regulations, 1992 (\"the Stockbrokers Regulations\", for short) for violation of Clause A(2) of the g Code of Conduct for Stockbrokers. The decisions hold that a broker would not be liable merely because he had facilitated the transactions, in the absence of any material to suggest negligence and connivance on the part of the broker. Thus, the matter would be different as observed in the concurring judgment 9 (2018) 13 sec 753, para 40 10 (2016) 6 sec 368 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

BHAVESH PABARI (Sanjiv Khanna, J.) 107 of Banumathi, J. in Rakhi Trading (P) Ltd. 9 , where there was evidence to show involvement and meeting of minds of the share broker with the client to indulge in egregious and foul transactions, in which circumstances the stockbroker would be held liable. While proximity of time in an isolated case may not be conclusive, but huge volume of trading between same set/group of brokers can in a given case reasonably point to some kind of a fraudulent and manipulative exercise with prior meeting of minds. Further, there is a difference between synchronised trading involving bulk quantities and negotiated trades as a result of consensual bargaining involving synchronisation of buy and sell orders resulting in matching thereof as per permissible parameters which are programmed accordingly. Test of preponderance of probability applies for the adjudication and determination of civil liability for violation of the SEBI Act or the provisions of the Regulations framed thereunder [see paras 65 to 69 in Rakhi Trading ( P) Ltd. 9]. Keeping the aforesaid parameters in mind, the adjudicating authority had imposed penalty of Rs 3,00,000 (Rupees three lakhs only) under Section 15-HB of the SEBI Act, which has been upheld by the Appellate Tribunal being commensurate with the violation. 43. For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any infirmity with the concurrent findings or with the quantum of penalty imposed and the same is upheld. CA No. 2641 of 2017 (Quantum Global Securities & Leasing Co. Ltd. v. SEBI) 44. In the present appeal, the appellant is the registered stockbroker and had indulged, as per the findings recorded in the adjudication order dated 22-7-2014 and upheld by the Appellate Tribunal vide order dated 18-1-2017 11 , in synchronised trades, circular trades and reversal trades in the scrips of Mis Gangotri Textiles Ltd. during the period 7-4-2006 to 31-5-2006. Accordingly, the appellant had violated Sections 12-A (a), (b ), (c) of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1), 4(2)(a), (e) and (g) of the PFUTP Regulations and Regulation 7 read with Clauses A(l), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of the Code of Conduct for Stockbrokers specified under Schedule II of the Stockbroker Regulations. Consequently, penalty ofRs 60,00,000 (Rupees sixty lakhs only) was imposed under Section 15-HA for violation of the provisions of the SEBI Act and the PFUTP Regulations and the penalty of Rs 15,00,000 (Rupees fifteen lakhs only) was imposed under Section 15-HB of the SEBI Act for the violation of the provisions of the Code of Conduct for Stockbrokers. 45. The appellant did not dispute the factual findings of having indulged in synchronised trade, circular trade and reversal trade in the scrips of Mis Gangotri Textiles Ltd. They pleaded leniency claiming that they had no mala fide intention and their annual turnover for several years was around Rs 5,00,000 (Rupees five lakhs only). Lastly, their contribution towards Last Traded Price (LTP) variation was nominal. The contentions have to be rejected as the appellant was a part of the larger game plan along with other entities who had indulged in synchronised, circular and reversal trading leading to a total 9 SEBI v.

It is to be further noted that the penalty imposable under Section 15-HA of the SEBI Act could be up to Rs 25,00,00,000 (Rupees twenty-five crores only) or three times the amount of profit made out of such practices whichever was higher. Thus, the penalty ofRs 60,00,000 (Rupees sixty lakhs only) was not unreasonable and excessive. Similarly, penalty ofRs 15,00,000 (Rupees fifteen lakhs only) for failing to adhere to the standards required to be maintained by the stockbrokers which could be as high as Rs 1,00,00,000 (Rupees one crore only) was not excessive, unreasonable or harsh. Penalty was also imposed on others who had participated in the nefarious plan. Findings are correct and unchallengeable. We do not find any good ground and reason to interfere with the quantum of penalty. CA No. 6160 of 2018 (Durga Prasad Yadav v. SEBI) 47. Durga Prasad Yadav and Jai Hind Kumar have filed the present appeal having suffered penalty of Rs 1,00,00,000 (Rupees one crore only) under Section 15-A(a) of the SEBI Act for violation of Section 11-C(3) of the SEBI Act vide adjudication order dated 20-1-2016 which stands affirmed by the Appellate Tribunal in its order dated 15-1-2018 12. 48. The appellants were required to furnish particulars about the plans/ schemes offered to the public, funds mobilised, Memorandum of Association, details of Directors, etc. in order to examine the matter under Section 11-AA of the SEBI Act and the SEBI (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 1999 (\"the CIS Regulations\", for short). For this purpose, various letters dated 22-11-2012, 11-1-2013, 7-11-2013 and 20-2-2014 were written by SEBI to the two appellant Directors, two other Directors and M/s Skylark Land Developers & Infrastructure India Pvt. Ltd. for furnishing of information/ documents/reports. Since there was an inordinate delay, default and failure in furnishing information and responding to these letters, fresh summons were issued on 30-7-2014 under Section 11-C(3) of the SEBI Act requiring them to furnish the details to which again there was no response. Consequently, second summons dated 12-9-2014 were issued for furnishing information by 22-9-2014, to which yet again there was no response. Thereafter, show- cause notice on 30-6-2015 was issued to which a part reply was given by the appellants on 23-9-2015. An email dated 30-11-2015 was also sent by SEBI asking them to reply before 10-12-2015, with an opportunity to appear on 15-12-2015. This was also communicated by forwarding the notice through Speed Post AD, which was returned undelivered in case of Durga Prasad. Thus, several opportunities were given to ensure compliance by the appellants. Afterwards, on 15-12-2015 Subodh Kumar Gupta, authorised representative of the appellants and others had appeared and sought adjournment for 22-12-2015, on which date a reply was filed. Subsequently, an additional reply dated 30-12-2015 was furnished. The appellants in the aforesaid replies had stated that their offices were sealed and, therefore, the required details and information could not be furnished.

BHAVESH PABARI (Sanjiv Khanna, J.) 109 with necessary documents including the copy of complaint, affidavit, evidence against them and the investigation report. 49. We would now refer to the background of the case and why notices/ summons were issued. The aforesaid notices and summons were issued pursuant to orders passed 13 by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in the year 2012 in public interest litigation against various companies including M/s Skylark Land Developer and Infrastructure India Pvt. Ltd. for cheating thousands of investors in fraudulent schemes by promising high returns. Pursuant to orders passed by the High Court, different authorities including SEBI were given liberty to take appropriate action in accordance with law. Central Bureau of Investigation was also directed to conduct investigation. Therefore, SEBI had issued notice to the aforesaid company, the two appellants and two other Directors to provide information of documents for alleged violation of Section 11-C of the SEBI Act. 50. During the course of hearing by SEBI, most details as provided by the appellants were general in nature. We would observe that in case there was no violation pertaining to mobilisation of funds from the public under various schemes/arrangements, this could have been so stated in clear and categoric terms. Moreover, the contention that the offices were sealed which rendered them incapable to furnish information has been rejected for two good reasons. First, this stand is belated and held to be an afterthought when it could have been raised at the first instance when the reply dated 5-12-2012 was furnished, given that the records were seized by the police on 5-5-2011. Second, assertion was contradicted by their own conduct when during the proceedings they had submitted a few documents, which were incomplete and not as desired. They did not make any distinction as to the documents within their possession and as to those with the police. The Appellate Tribunal had in these circumstances affirmed the finding that there was a lack of good faith and failure in complying with the aforesaid notices/letters/summons/emails. The adjudicating officer had, therefore, rightly recorded that non-compliance of summons had hampered the further course of investigation. The failure was without any justification. Agreeing with the said findings, the Appellate Tribunal has observed that details were withheld with a view to delay the investigation being conducted by SEBI to the detriment of investors from whom funds were collected by the appellants in contravention of the CIS Regulations. 51. We do not find any fault with the reasoning given. We are of the opinion that the fault squarely lay with the appellants and, thus, penalty of Rs 1,00,00,000 (Rupees one crore only) for violation of Section 1 l-C(3) under Section 15-A(a) of the SEBI Act does not call for any interference. 52. The reference made vide order dated 14-3-2016 1 and the above captioned civil appeals are, accordingly, disposed of. In the facts and circumstances of the cases, there shall be no order as to costs. 13 Dhannvir Singh v. Union of India, 2012 SCC OnLine MP 4837 l Siddharth Chaturvedi v.
