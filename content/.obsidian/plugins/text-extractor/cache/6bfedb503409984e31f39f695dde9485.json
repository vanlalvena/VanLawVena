On 19-12-1963, he gifted away 127.1 bighas of land to his son, N. After the said transfer, the appellant was left with 17 .25 standard acres of land, which was below the prescribed limit under the Ceiling Act, 1973. Although, a proceeding was initiated under the Ceiling law, the same was dropped on 15-4-1972 by the Court of Deputy Sub-Divisional Officer. While dropping the proceedings, the court observed that, the amendment of Section 30-DD of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 was effective from 31-12-1969, and since the gift deed was executed before the aforesaid amendment, the aforesaid transfer was valid. However, by Notice dated 15-3-1982, the Revenue Ceiling Department reopened the case of the appellant. The Revenue Ceiling Department while issuing the aforesaid notice stated that the earlier order dated 15-4-1972, passed by the Court of Deputy Sub-Divisional Officer was rendered without investigating whether the land transfers are recognisable as per the provisions of Section 30 of the 19 55 Act. The same being in contravention of the provisions, needs to be reopened. The Court of Additional District Collector declared that the mutation of the land done in favour of the son of the appellant was invalid as there was no acceptance of the gift. It was declared therein that the appellant was holding 11 standard acres of extra land over and above the ceiling limit. The Collector, therefore, directed the appellant to hand over vacant possession of the aforesaid 11 standard acres of extra land to the Tahsildar. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the appellant preferred an appeal before the Board of Revenue. The Board of Revenue, modified the order passed by the Additional District Collector, and upon recalculation held that the appellant is holding 4.5 standard acres of land in excess of the ceiling limit. Aggrieved, the appellant preferred a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution before the High Court. The Single Judge of the High Court allowed the writ petition preferred by the appellant. The Court held that the case was beyond the purview of Section 6 of the 1973 Ceiling Act because the land was transferred by way of gift before 26-9-1970. It was further held that the aforesaid transfer of land, by the appellant in favour of his son by virtue of a registered gift deed, being bona fide, was valid in the eye of the law. The Single Judge, therefore held that there is no surplus land which is available with the appellant which can be resumed. Thereafter, the respondents preferred an appeal against the above order before the Division Bench of the High Court, which allowed the appeal holding that the gift deed was invalid as the son of the appellant was unaware about the same.

Therefore, the Division Bench of the High Court set aside the order passed by the Single Judge Bench for being untenable and upheld the order passed by the Board of Revenue. Aggrieved, the appellant has preferred the present appeal by way of special leave petition before the Supreme Court. The issues for determination before the Supreme Court were: (i) Whether reopening of the case was beyond the period of limitation? (ii) Whether the registered gift deed executed by the appellant is valid in the eye of the law? (iii) Whether the judgment of the Single Judge is in ignorance of the provisions of Sections 30-C and 30-D of the Tenancy Act, 1955? Allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court Held: Section 122 TPA provides that for a gift to be valid, it must be gratuitous in nature and must be made voluntarily. The said giving away implies a complete dispossession of the ownership in the property by the donor. Acceptance of a gift by the donee can be done anytime during the lifetime of the donor. (Para 20) Acceptance by or on behalf of the donee must be made during the lifetime of the donor and while he is still capable of giving. (Para 22) Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker v. Pranjivandas Maganlal Thakker, (1997) 2 SCC 255, followed on this point [Ed.: Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker case has impliedly been held to be partly per incuriam by a three-Judge Bench in Renikuntla Rajamma v. K. Sarwanamma, (2014) 9 SCC 445: see paras 16 to 19 thereof] a b C d Section 122 TPA neither defines acceptance, nor does it prescribe any particular mode for accepting the gift. The word \"acceptance\" is defined as \"the e receipt of a thing offered by another with an intention to retain it, as acceptance of a gift\". (Para 24) Ramanatha P. Aiyar: The Law Lexicon, 2nd Edn. , relied on Acceptance of the gift can be ascertained from the surrounding circumstances such as taking into possession the property by the donee or by being in the possession of the gift deed itself. The only requirement stipulated here is that, f the acceptance of the gift must be effectuated within the lifetime of the donor itself. (Para 25) Hence, being an act of receiving willingly, acceptance can be inferred by the implied conduct of the donee. (Para 26) There may be various means to prove acceptance of a gift. The document may be handed over to a donee, which in a given situation may also amount to a valid g acceptance. The fact that possession had been given to the donee also raises a presumption of acceptance. (Para 26) Asokan v. Lakshmikutty, (2007) 13 SCC 210, affinned In the present case, the recitals in the gift deed clearly indicate that donor intended to part with ownership and possession immediately after the execution of the gift deed.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e DAULAT SINGH v. STATE OF RAJASTHAN 463 The donee was already a major at the time of the execution of the gift deed. He further stated that after execution of the gift deed the donee started cultivating on the same. (Para 28) In the statement rendered by the appellant donor before the Court of Additional District Magistrate the donee clearly stated that, as he did not get along with his stepmother, he started living separately and the land that was transferred to him by virtue of gift deed was under his possession and he was cultivating the same. (Para 29) Therefore, the abovementioned circumstances clearly indicate that there was an acceptance of the gift by the donee during the lifetime of the donor. Not only the gift deed in itself contained recitals about transfer of possession, but also the mutation records and the statements of the both the donor and donee indicate that, there has been an acceptance of the gift by conduct. (Para 30) Moreover, the deed is registered, bears the signature of the donor and has been attested by two witnesses, the requirements under Section 123 TPA have been satisfied. Hence there was a complete and valid gift. (Para 31) Section 15 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 mandates that after the expiry of five years from the date of final order sought to be reopened, or after the expiry of 30-6-1979, whichever is later, no notice for re-opening of such cases can be issued. Therefore, the relevant dates for determination of the issue of limitation is the date of order sought to be reopened and the date of issuance of show-cause notice under Section 15 of the Ceiling Act, 1973. (Para 14) In the present case the notice for re-opening of the case was sent to the appellant on 20-11-1976 i.e. within five years of the earlier order dated 15-4-1972. Further, the notice also satisfied the requirements as provided under Section 15 of the Ceiling Act, 1973, and hence was valid in the eye of the law. The case was, thus, reopened within the time period stipulated under Section 15 of the Ceiling Act, 1973. (Para 16) The High Court, while passing the impugned order, erroneously held the registered gift deed dated 19-12-1963 to be invalid on the basis that it did not meet the requirements as provided under Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. (Para 17) f Section 30-C of the Tenancy Act of 1955 provides for the ceiling limit of 30 standard acres for a family of five members or less. The appellant admittedly was having a family of less than five members and was originally holding around 34.4 standard acres. Subsequently, by virtue of registered gift deed dated 19-12-1963, the appellant had transferred around 17 .25 standard acres to his son. (Para 36) Section 30-D of the 1955 Act provides that any transfer, on or after 25-2-1958, g other than the ones provided in sub-sections (l)(i) and (l)(ii) of Section 30-D of the 1955 Act shall be deemed to have been entered to defeat the purpose of the Ceiling Act. Such transactions were declared to be void. The aforesaid two exceptions being transfer by partition and transfer to a landless person. (Para 37) However, Section 30-DD of the 1955 Act provides further exceptions to Section 30-D of the 1955 Act as it recognises certain transfer after the cut-off date h provided under Section 30-D. Section 30-DD recognises transfers of area up to 30 standard acres made in favour of an agriculturalist, his son or brother who are ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

However, such transfer must have been made before 31-12-1969 and the transferee must have attained the age of majority on or before the aforesaid date. (Para 38) It is, thus, apparent that the legislature has carved out two separate categories of lands, one which is includable and other which is outside the purview of Ceiling laws. Once such a classification has been made, with there being no challenge to its vires, it is the solemn duty of every authority to give full effect to the same, in both letter and spirit. Although, it is possible that there can be a voluntary transfer which would meet the qualifications of both Sections 30-D and Section 30-DD, however, it is significant to note that Section 30-DD opens up with a non obstante clause with overriding effect on Section 30-D, as a result of which, any land included within its purview would be protected from the rigours of Section 30-D of the 1955 Act. Therefore, if the appellant succeeds in his endeavour to establish that the transfer was covered under Section 30-DD of the 1955 Act, then such transferred land has to be exempted from computation of confiscable land, irrespective of the fact that it falls within the ceiling limit as prescribed under Section 30-D of the 1955 Act. (Para 41) In the present case due to certain family issues, the appellant and his son were living separately. During such separation, when the transferee son had already attained the age of majority, the appellant owner of the land, who was an agriculturalist himself, transferred the aforesaid land in favour of his son, so as to enable him to cultivate the same. The statements of the transferor and the transferee clearly indicate that the transferee had the equipment and skills and was sustaining himself as an agriculturalist. (Para 43) The aforesaid transfer was executed way before the cut-off date stipulated under Section 30-DD of the 1955 Act i.e. 31-12-1969. Therefore, the registered gift deed dated 19-12-1963 was a bona fide transfer squarely covered within the ambits of Section 30-DD, which intended to protect the rights of agriculturalists. Issue 3, stands answered in favour of the appellant, as the transfer is not invalid as it stands protected as per the provision of Section 30-DD of the 1955 Act. (Para 44) In light of the aforesaid findings, the transfer of the land being valid under Section 30-DD of the 1955 Act, the ceiling area of the appellant falls within the ceiling limit as provided under Section 30-C of the 1955 Act. (Para 45) There is no gainsaying that Section 6 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 also does not advance the case of the State. Firstly, the repeal of Chapter III-B of the Tenancy Act, 1955 through Section 40 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 is not retrospective. Hence, the provisions of the Ceiling Act, 1973 are not attracted in the present case as the case was reopened and decided under the provisions of the Tenancy Act, 1955. Secondly, Section 6 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 declares that every transfer of land including by way of gift, made on or after 26-9-1970 and before 1-1-1973, shall be deemed to have been made to defeat the provisions of the Ceiling Act, 1973.In the instant case, the gift deed was executed on 19-12-1963, that is, much before 26-9-1970.Therefore also, Section 6 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 does not affect the transfer of land by the appellant donor in favour of the donee son. Thirdly, there is no finding that the gift deed in the present case was actuated upon any extraneous consideration. Hence, it constitutes a bona fide transfer which is exempted from the rigours of Section 6 of the Ceiling Act, 1973.

The facts underlying the appeal are as follows: Daulat Singh (since deceased and now represented through his legal representatives and who shall hereinafter for the sake of convenience be referred to as the appellant) was owner of 254.2 bighas of land. On 19-12-1963, he gifted away 127.1 bighas of land to his son, N arpat Singh. After the said transfer, the appellant was left with 17 .25 standard acres of land, which was below the prescribed limit under the Ceiling Act. 3. Although, a proceeding was initiated under the Ceiling law, the same was dropped on 15-4-1972 by the Court of Deputy Sub-Divisional Officer, Pali, Rajasthan. While dropping the proceedings, the court observed that, the amendment of Section 30-DD of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 (hereinafter \"the Tenancy Act, 1955\") was effective from 31-12-1969, and since the gift deed was executed before the aforesaid amendment, the aforesaid transfer was valid. 4. However, by Notice dated 15-3-1982, the Revenue Ceiling Department reopened the case of the appellant. The Revenue Ceiling Department while issuing the aforesaid notice stated that the earlier order dated 15-4-1972, passed by the Court of Deputy Sub-Divisional Officer, Pali was rendered without investigating whether the land transfers are recognisable as per the provisions of Section 30 of the Tenancy Act, 1955.

It was a declared therein that the appellant was holding 11 standard acres of extra land over and above the ceiling limit. The Collector, therefore, directed the appellant to hand over vacant possession of the aforesaid 11 standard acres of extra land to the Tahsildar, Pali. 6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the appellant preferred an appeal before the Board of Revenue. Vide order dated 2-7-1990, the Board of Revenue, b modified the earlier order dated 28-10-1988, and upon recalculation held that the appellant is holding 4.5 standard acres of land in excess of the ceiling limit. 7. Aggrieved, the appellant preferred a writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India before the High Court. Vide order dated 2-4-1997 2 , the learned Single Judge of the High Court allowed the writ petition preferred by the appellant. The Court held that the case was beyond the purview of Section 6 c of the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973 (hereinafter \"the 1973 Ceiling Act\") because the land was transferred by way of gift before 26-9-1970. It was further held that the aforesaid transfer of land, by the appellant in favour of his son by virtue of a registered gift deed, being bona fide, was valid in the eye of the law.

The Division Bench clearly erred in not recognising the transfer of 17.25 acres in favour of the appellant's son Narpat Singh, who was a major at the time the gift deed was executed, during his lifetime, as per the requirements of Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. There was an implied acceptance because this is a case of transfer between father and son. On the basis of facts of this case, it is proved that the g son was living separately with his family. Moreover, such a transfer does not violate the provisions of Section 30-C and Section 30-D of the Tenancy Act, 1955. Lastly, the counsel also pleaded that the notice given for reopening of the ceiling case was beyond the period of limitation. h 2 Daulat v.

On the other hand , the counsel on behalf of the respondents argued that the Division Bench rightly upheld the order passed by the Board of Revenue which was passed after detailed assessment of the facts and appropriate reliance upon Section 30-C and 30-D of the Tenancy Act, 1955. The respondents submitted that the findings of facts could not be interfered with in a writ proceeding. The respondents also stated that, issue of limitation was never argued by the appellant in the courts below. Be that as it may, the notice was issued within the limitation period. 12. Having heard the learned counsel, three important issues arise for our consideration: 12.1. (i) Whether reopening of the case was beyond the period of limitation? 12.2. (ii) Whether the registered gift deed executed by the appellant is valid in the eye of the law? 12.3. (ii) Whether the judgment2 of the learned Single Judge is in ignorance of the provisions of Sections 30-C and 30-D of the Tenancy Act, 1955? Issue 1 13. Section 15 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 confers upon the State Government the power to reopen the cases, if it is satisfied that the earlier order was in contravention with the provisions of the Act and is prejudicial to the State interest. The aforesaid direction to reopen cases must be preceded by a show- cause notice served upon the person concerned. However, the proviso clause states that no notice can be issued after the expiry of five years from the date of the final order sought to be reopened or after the expiry of 30-6-1979, whichever is later. 14. Therefore, the provision mandates that, after the expiry of five years from the date of final order sought to be reopened, or after the expiry of 30-6-1979, whichever is later, no notice for reopening of such cases can be issued. Therefore, the relevant dates for determination of the issue of limitation is the date of order sought to be reopened and the date of issuance of show- cause notice under Section 15 of the Ceiling Act, 1973. 15. During the course of the hearing and on a query raised by the Bench, the respondents have brought to our notice the xerox copy of the Notice dated 20-11-1976 issued by Deputy Government Secretary, Revenue (Billing), Rajasthan. 16. It ought to be noted that, the aforesaid notice was sent to the appellant on 20-11-1976, that is within five years of the earlier order dated 15-4-1972. Further, the notice also satisfied the requirements as provided under Section 15 of the Ceiling Act, 1973, and hence was valid in the eye of the law. The case was, thus , reopened within the time period stipulated under Section 15 of the Ceiling Act, 1973. Therefore, Issue 1 is answered in favour of the respondent State. 2 Dau/at v.

The High Court, while passing the impugned order 1, held the registered gift deed dated 19-12-1963 to be invalid on the basis that it did not meet the requirements as provided under Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The Division Bench while upholding the observations of the Board of Revenue, further observed that a perusal of the gift deed does not show acceptance of gift by the donee, rather it seems that donee was even unaware of the gift. 18. Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides that: \"122. \"Gift\" defined.-\"Gift\" is the transfer of certain existing movable or immovable property made voluntarily and without consideration, by one person, called the donor, to another, called the donee, and accepted by or on behalf of the donee. Acceptance when to be made.-Such acceptance must be made during the lifetime of the donor and while he is still capable of giving. If the donee dies before acceptance, the gift is void.\" 19. Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides that: \"123. Transfer how effected.-For the purpose of making a gift of immovable property, the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two witnesses. For the purpose of making a gift of movable property, the transfer may be effected either by a registered instrument signed as aforesaid or by delivery. Such delivery may be made in the same way as goods sold may be delivered.\" 20. Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides that for a gift to be valid, it must be gratuitous in nature and must be made voluntarily. The said giving away implies a complete dispossession of the ownership in the property by the donor. Acceptance of a gift by the donee can be done anytime during the lifetime of the donor. 21. Section 123 provides that for a gift of immovable property to be valid, the transfer must be effectuated by means of a registered instrument bearing the signature of the donor and attested by at least two witnesses. 22. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker v. Pranjivandas Maganlal Thakker 3 had held that: (SCC p. 258, paras 6-7) \"6.

It would thus be clear that the execution of a registered gift deed, acceptance of the gift and delivery* of the property, together make the gift complete. Thereafter, the donor is divested of his title and the donee becomes the absolute owner of the property.\" (emphasis supplied) 23. The Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned judgment 1 upheld the :findings of the Board of Revenue wherein it held that there was no valid acceptance by the donee. The Additional District Collector held that there was no semblance of acceptance in the gift deed. On appeal, the Board of Revenue held that, \"it is irrelevant that after the gift the land remained in possession of the donee or that he got it mutated in his name\". The Division Bench 1 of the High Court, relying on the aforesaid observation, stated that there was no valid acceptance as it seems like the donee was unaware about the gift deed itself. 24. At the outset, it ought to be noted that Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 neither defines acceptance, nor does it prescribe any particular mode for accepting the gift. The word \"acceptance\" is defined as \"is the receipt of a thing offered by another with an intention to retain it, as acceptance of a gift\". (See Ramanatha P. Aiyar: The Law Lexicon, 2nd Edn., p. 19.) * Ed.: Delivery of possession is not an essential prerequisite for the making of a valid gift in the case of immovable property, as was clarified by a three-Judge Bench in Renikuntla Rajamma v. K. Sarwanamma, (2014) 9 SCC 445, which also held in para 19 that Magan/al Thakker, (1997) 2 SCC 255, \"cannot be read to be an authority for the proposition that delivery of possession is an essential requirement for making a valid gift.\" In paras 16 and 18 of Renikuntla Rajamma case it was held: \"16 . ... Section 123 of the TP Act is in two parts. The first part deals with gifts of immovable property while the second part deals with gifts of movable property. Insofar as the gifts of immovable property are concerned, Section 123 makes transfer by a registered instrument mandatory. This is evident from the use of word \"transfer must be effected\" used by Parliament insofar as immovable property is concerned. In contradiction to that requirement the second part of Section 123 dealing with gifts of movable property, simply requires that gift of movable property may be effected either by a registered instrument signed as aforesaid or \"by delivery\". The difference in the two provisions lies in the fact that insofar as the transfer of movable property by way of gift is concerned the same can be effected by a registered instrument or by delivery. Such transfer in the case of immovable property no doubt requires a registered instrument but the provision does not make delivery of possession of the immovable property gifted as an additional requirement for the gift to be valid and effective. If the intention of the legislature was to make delivery of possession of the property gifted also as a condition precedent for a valid gift, the provision could and indeed would have specifically said so. Absence of any such requirement can only lead us to the conclusion that delivery of possession is not an essential prerequisite for the making of a valid gift in the case of immovable property. * * * 18. We are in respectful agreement with the statement of law contained in the above passage in K. Balakrishnan, (2004) 1 SCC 581. There is indeed no provision in law that ownership in property cannot be gifted without transfer of possession of such property. As noticed earlier, Section 123 does not make the delivery of possession of the gifted property essential for validity of a gift .... \" l State v.

The aforesaid fact can be ascertained from the surrounding circumstances such as taking into possession the property by the donee or by being in the possession of the gift deed itself. The only requirement stipulated here is that, the acceptance of the gift must be effectuated within the lifetime of the donor itself. 26. Hence, being an act of receiving willingly, acceptance can be inferred by the implied conduct of the donee. The aforesaid position has been reiterated by this Court in Asokan v. Lakshmikutty4 : (SCC pp. 215-16, para 14) \"14. Gifts do not contemplate payment of any consideration or compensation. It is, however, beyond any doubt or dispute that in order to constitute a valid gift acceptance thereof is essential. We must, however, notice that the Transfer of Property Act does not prescribe any particular mode of acceptance. It is the circumstances attending to the transaction which may be relevant for determining the question. There may be various means to prove acceptance of a gift. The document may be handed over to a donee, which in a given situation may also amount to a valid acceptance. The fact that possession had been given to the donee also raises a presumption of acceptance.\" (emphasis supplied) 27. In the present case, the gift deed itself contained certain recitals as mentioned below: \" ... Out of the aforesaid land in all the khasras 1/2 part means 50 per cent I am giving you in gift being my younger son with my pleasure. My elder son Shri Babu Singh has no objection to this gift ... From today you are the owner of the half of the land gifted to you and you will have possession hereafter. You have the complete right over the aforesaid land for cultivation from today onward. Now you get the gifted land mutated in your name ... These lands have not been sold or under will or under the gift earlier. Further I state that the aforesaid land is free from any debt liability ... The registration of the aforesaid gift has been done by me in my sound physical and mental health with consent without any undue coercion and pressure from anyone. I have gifted the aforesaid land with my sweet will and wish .... \" These recitals clearly indicate that donor intended to part with ownership and possession immediately after the execution of the gift deed. 28. In order to show acceptance, the counsel for the appellant drew our attention to the mutation records. The mutation entry in the Revenue Record of Gram Sedriya, District Pali dated 28-10-1968 clearly reflects that half portion of the appellant's land was bestowed as a gift by the appellant to his son through a registered instrument of gift dated 19-12-1963. Furthermore, the statement dated 31-8-1984, rendered by the appellant donor before the Court of Additional District Magistrate indicates that the donee was already a major at the time of the execution of the gift deed. He further stated that after execution of the gift deed the donee started cultivating on the same. 29.

Therein, the donee clearly stated that, as he did not get along with his stepmother, he started living separately and the land that was transferred to him by virtue of gift deed was under his possession and he was cultivating the same. 30. Therefore, the abovementioned circumstances clearly indicate that there was an acceptance of the gift by the donee during the lifetime of the donor. Not only the gift deed in itself contained recitals about transfer of possession, but also the mutation records and the statements of the both the donor and donee indicate that, there has been an acceptance of the gift by conduct. 31. The respondents failed to bring on record any evidence to rebut the fact that the donee was in enjoyment of the property. In light of the same, the learned Single Judge Bench took a plausible view that, it was a transfer between a father and a son and there was a valid acceptance of the gift when the donee son started living separately. Lastly, it ought to be noted that apart from the point of acceptance by the donee as held above since the deed is registered, bears the signature of the donor and has been attested by two witnesses, the requirements under Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 have been satisfied. In line with the aforementioned observations, Issue 2 is answered in favour of the appellant. Issue 3 32. The learned Division Bench, while setting aside the judgment2 of the learned Single Judge observed 1 that the learned Single Judge passed the order in ignorance of the provisions of Sections 30-C and 30-D of the Tenancy Act of 1955. However, the counsel on behalf of the appellant has argued that the transfer of land made by the appellant to his son does not violate the terms of Sections 30-C and Section 30-D as contained in Chapter III-B of the Tenancy Act of 1955 (since repealed by the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973) as such a transfer satisfies the test of Section 30-DD of the Tenancy Act of 1955. 33. Chapter III-B of the Tenancy Act of 1955, comprising of Sections 30-B to 30-J deals with restrictions on holding land in excess of ceiling limit. Section 30-C indicates the extent of ceiling area. This section provides that for a family consisting of five or less members, the ceiling area would be thirty standard acres. When a family exceeds five members, five acres of ceiling area shall be extended for every additional member, however, such area cannot extend beyond sixty standard acres. 34. Section 30-D provides that all transfers, except those which are specified under sub-section (1) are not to be recognised for determination of holding with respect to the ceiling area. Thereafter, Section 30-DD, a subsequent amendment to the Tenancy Act of 1955 provides further exceptions to the general bar under Section 30-D. 35. It is pertinent for us to have a look at the relevant Sections 30-D and 30-DD. The sections read as follows: \"30-D.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h DAULAT SINGH v. STATE OF RAJASTHAN (N. V. Ramana, J.) 473 36. As discussed earlier, Section 30-C of the Tenancy Act of 1955 provides for the ceiling limit of 30 standard acres for a family of five members or less. The appellant admittedly was having a family of less than five members and was originally holding around 34.4 standard acres. Subsequently, by virtue of registered gift deed dated 19-12-1963, the appellant had transferred around 17.25 standard acres to his son. 37. Section 30-D provides that any transfer, on or after 25-2-1958, other than the ones provided in sub-sections (1 )(i) and (1 )(ii) shall be deemed to have been entered to defeat the purpose of the Ceiling Act. Such transactions were declared to be void. The aforesaid two exceptions being transfer by partition and transfer to a landless person. 38. However, Section 30-DD provides further exceptions to Section 30-D as it recognises certain transfer after the cut-off date provided under Section 30-D. Section 30-DD recognises transfers of area up to 30 standard acres made in favour of an agriculturalist, his son or brother who are capable of doing agriculture and also intend to take up agriculture as a profession. However, such transfer must have been made before 31-12-1969 and the transferee must have attained the age of majority on or before the aforesaid date. 39. In the present case, the respondents have submitted that the transfer is barred under Section 30-D, therefore the State has a right of resumption over the excess area of 4.5 acres as per Section 30-C. On the contrary, the appellant has argued that the transfer was protected under Section 30-DD. 40. Our attention is drawn again to the registered gift deed dated 19-12-1963. The gift deed itself contains the recitals that: \" ... The aforesaid land which is of my khatedari (ownership) and on which I am carrying out cultivation and is in my possession. Out of the aforesaid land in all the khasras 1/2 part means 50 per cent I am giving you in gift being my younger son with my pleasure .... From today you are the owner of the half of the land gifted to you and you will have possession hereafter. You have the complete right over the aforesaid land for cultivation from today onward. Now you get the gifted land mutated in your name.\" (emphasis supplied) 41. It is, thus, apparent that the legislature has carved out two separate categories of lands, one which is ineluctable and other which is outside the purview of Ceiling laws. Once such a classification has been made, with there being no challenge to its vires, it is the solemn duty of every authority to give full effect to the same, in both letter and spirit. Although, it is possible that there can be a voluntary transfer which would meet the qualifications of both Sections 30-D and Section 30-DD, however, it is significant to note that Section 30-DD opens up with a non obstante clause with overriding effect on Section 30-D, as a result of which, any land included within its purview would be protected from the rigours of Section 30-D of the Tenancy Act of 1955. Therefore, if the appellant succeeds in his endeavour to establish that the transfer was covered under Section 30-DD of the Tenancy Act of 1955, then such transferred land has to be exempted from computation of confiscable land, irrespective of the fact that it falls within the ceiling limit as prescribed under Section 30-D of the Tenancy Act of 1955. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Another significant piece of evidence is the statement of the transferor appellant dated 31-8-1984, wherein he has stated that the transferee son was living separately and was cultivating the aforesaid gifted property. It is also mentioned that the transferee is in possession of an ox and equipments for ploughing and agriculture. The aforesaid facts have been reiterated by the transferee as well vide his statement dated 15-12-1988, wherein he has clearly stated that, he is in independent possession of the gifted property and has been cultivating the said land. 43. The aforesaid pieces of evidence clearly indicate that due to certain family issues, the appellant and his son were living separately. During such separation, when the transferee son had already attained the age of majority, the appellant owner of the land, who was an agriculturalist himself, transferred the aforesaid land in favour of his son, so as to enable him to cultivate the same. The statements of the transferor and the transferee clearly indicate that the transferee had the equipment and skills and was sustaining himself as an agriculturalist. 44. Lastly, it must be taken into consideration that the aforesaid transfer was executed way before the cut-off date stipulated under Section 30-DD i.e. 31-12-1969. Therefore, the registered gift deed dated 19-12-1963 was a bona fide transfer squarely covered within the ambits of Section 30-DD, which intended to protect the rights of agriculturalists. Issue 3, stands answered in favour of the appellant, as the transfer is not invalid as it stands protected as per the provision of Section 30-DD of the Tenancy Act of 1955. 45. In light of the aforesaid findings, the decision 1 rendered by the Division Bench of the High Court is liable to be set aside. The transfer of the land being valid under Section 30-DD of the Tenancy Act of 1955, the ceiling area of the appellant falls within the ceiling limit as provided under Section 30-C. 46. There is no gainsaying that Section 6 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 also does not advance the case of the State. Firstly, the repeal of Chapter III- B of the Tenancy Act, 1955 through Section 40 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 is not retrospective. Hence, the provisions of the Ceiling Act, 1973 are not attracted in the present case as the case was reopened and decided under the provisions of the Tenancy Act, 1955. Secondly, Section 6 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 declares that every transfer of land including by way of gift, made on or after 26-9-1970 and before 1-1-1973, shall be deemed to have been made to defeat the provisions of the Ceiling Act, 1973. In the instant case, the gift deed was executed on 19-12-1963, that is much before 26-9-1970. Therefore also, Section 6 of the Ceiling Act, 1973 does not affect the transfer of land by the appellant donor in favour of the donee son. Thirdly, there is no finding that the gift deed in the present case was actuated upon any extraneous consideration. Hence, it constitutes a bona fide transfer which are exempted from the rigours of Section 6 of the Ceiling Act, 1973. 47. The appeal stands allowed in the aforesaid terms. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. l State v. Daulat Singh, Civil Special Appeal No. 264 of 1999, order dated 25-4-2008 (Raj) a b C d e f g h","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
