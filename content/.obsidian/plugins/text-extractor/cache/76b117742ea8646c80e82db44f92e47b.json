The Collector, Rangoon ( 1) and Special Officer v. Desabhai Bezangi Motiwala (2), which latter case removed any doubt whether the judgment in the former applied to an appeal under the letters patent, it is clear that there was no right of appeal to the Privy Council in this case unless that right was given by Act XIX. of 1921. The Act had not that effect. As s. 71 of the Calcutta Improvement Act, 1911 (which may be called the local Act) excluded the operation of s. 54 of the Land Acquisition Act, 18g4, the amendment of that section cannot possibly affect the matter. The High Court held, however, that Act XIX. of 1921 by adding to s. 26 of the Act of 1894 a provision that an award of the Court under the Act of 1894 was to be deemed to be a decree had indirectly given a right of appeal under the letters patent. It is submitted that that view was erroneous. In 1911 a right of appeal to the Privy Council in cases under the Land Acquisition Act. 1 894, was supposed to exist as the effect of s. 54 of that Act. By s. 71 the Local Act excluded the operation of s. 54 and expressly provided that the award should be final. This clearly shows an intention that there should be no appeal to the Privy Council.

Dunne K. · C. and Wallach for the Secretary of State. The decree appealed from is a final decree of the High Court, and the onus is on those who • contend that no appeal lies to the Privy Council under cl. 39 of the letters patent. The addition made by Act XIX . of 192 I to s. 26 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, become part of the local Act. The local Act did not merely incorporate certain sections of the Act of 1894; it provided by s. 69 that the trustees could acquire land \"under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.\" Any amendment of that Act not inconsistent with the local Ac£ became part of it. The modifications of the Act of 1894 by s. 71 of the local Act do not relate to s. 26. The addition to that section is therefore consistent with the local Act. The effect of the addition is that the award of the tribunal is to be deemed to be a \"decree\" and its grounds a \"judgment.'' There is therefore an appeal to the High Court under cl. 16 ~f the letters patent, and from the High Court to the Privy Council under cl. 39. It was necessary, or at any rate desirable, also to amend s. 54, in order to make it clear that there was to be a right of appeal both under the Code and under th~ letters patent. De Gruyther K.

Neither party was satisfied with the High Court's decision. The Secretary of State applied for a certificate enabling an appeal to His Majei;ty in Council. The Society objected that no appeal lay, but asked in effect that if a certificate _ were granted to the Secretary of State a certificate should a]so be granted to them. The High Court granted certificates to both parties. The appeals were duly admitted and are before the Board for determination. The Society contend, as they did in the High Court, that no appeal is competent, and this question has been argued before their Lordships as a preliminary point. It ic; with it alone that this judgment is concerned. By the Act above referred to, which their Lordships will call for convenience the local Act, a Board of Trustees was constituted and was invested with very wide powers for the purpose of carrying out improvement schemes within the municipal limits of Calcutta. It was obvious that for this purpose the necessity would arise fer the compulsory acqui- sition of land on a large scale, and the Bengal Government no doubt thought that it would facilitate the proceedings of the trustees if they had a special code of their own under which such acquishions should be made, instead of leaving this matt~r to be dealt with by the Land Acquisitbn ,Act of 1894, which was of general application throughout British India. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Indian Appeals, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.

The SornZTY, Court then proceeds to deal with the matter upon the lines laid down by the- Act, and its proceedings terminate again in an award, from which under s. 54 an appeal lies to the High Court. It was held by this Board in 191 '2 (see Rangoon Botatoung Co. v. Collector vf Rangoon ( 1)) that under this Act no appeal lay from the High Court to His Majesty in Council, the ground of the decision being that the proceedings throughout were in the nature · of arbitration proceedings, and that no appeal being given in terms to His Majesty in council, no such appeal lay. Part IV. of tht> local Act deals with the acquisition of land for the purposes of that Act. It provides that the trustees may make such acquisitions under the Land Acquisition Act, but proceeds to modify that Act for the purposes of the local Act. The modifications are contained partly in the body of the Act and partly in a schedule attached to the Act. They are numerous and substantial, and the effect is, in their Lordships' opinion, to enact for the purp~cs of the local Act a special law for the acquisition of land by the trustees witl\\in the limited area over which their powers extend. The most important departure from the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, so far as the present appeal is concerned, is that the local Act constitutes a \" tribunal \" to take the place of the \"Court \" under the general Act.

It is intituled '' an act to modify certain provisions of the Calcutta Improvement Act, 19u, ,. and provides that, notwithstanding anything contained in that Act, an appeal shall lie to the Bengal High Court in certain cases, one of which is where the president grants a ocrtificate that the case is a fit one for appeal, but subject to certain definite limitations therein i;et out. The reason for this i;omewhat unusual course of legislation is, their Lordships have no doubt, to be found in what had happened previously in Bombay. There in 1898 the Local Legis]ature enacted a City Improvement Act (Born. Act IV. of 1898), upon which it is probable that the Calcutta Act was to some extent modeJkd. The Bombay Act set up a similar tribunal to perform the functions of the Court under the Land Acquisition Act, and enacted that the award of the tribunal should be final, subject to an appeal to the High Court in any case in which the president should certify the cas~ as a fit one for appeal. The validity of this Act was questioned in Hari v. Secretary of State for India ( 1 ), and Sir Lawrence Jenkins, then Chief Justice of Bombay, held tha.t this pat\"ticuJar provision, giving the limited right of appeal to the High Court, was ultra vires the LocaJ Legis- lature. Accordingly, Act XIV. of 1904 was passed by the GovemCU'•General in Council to validate the Bombay Act. It was evidently the intention of the Bengal Legislature to follow in the matter of appeals from the tribunal under their Act the generaJ lines of the Bombay enactment, and this could only be done safely with the aid in their case aJso of the higher legislative authority.

The right of appeal claimed is SOCIETY. based upon an amendment of the Land Acquisition Act, which, it is said, al'lo operates upon the local Act, and this is the real question in the present appeal. The amendment relied upon was effected by Act XIX. of 192 I of the \" Indian Legislature\" : see s. 63 of the Govern- ment of India Act, 1919. By this Act a new sub-section was added to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, under which every award of the Court under that Act was to be deemed to be a decree, and the statement of the grounds of the award a judgment, within the definitions of \" decree\" and \" judg- ment '' respectively contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The amending Act also substituted for s. 54 of the Land Acquisition Act a new section, which gave in terms a right of appeal to His Majesty in Council from any decref passed by the High Court on appeal from an award of the Court. Having regard to the provisions of s. 71 of the local Act above referred to, under which the tribunal is ,not deemed to be the \" Court \" for the purposes of s. 54 of the Land Acquisition Act, it is, their Lordships think, clear that. the amendment of s. 54 cannot assist the contention presented to them on behalf c f the Secretary of State. For even if the borrowing by the local Act in 1911 from the Land Acquisition Act could be held to include the new s. 54, an award of the tribunal would not, by the express words of the local Act, come within its provisions.

It is said that this amendment of itself is sufficient to displace the grounds upon which the Board held in the Rangoon Botatoung Co.' s case (I) that no appeal lay. If effect were given to this argument it would seem to follow that the amtndment of s. 54 was wholly superfluous, and the i;omewhat strange resuJt would be arrived at that though the provision of the amending Act by which the right of appeal to His Majesty in Council is expressly given was excluded in the case of awards by the tribunal, they were nevertheless to be so appealable by impli<;ation from another section. But their Lordships think that there are other and perhaps more cogent objections to this contention of the Secretary of State, and their Lordships are not prepared to hold that the sub-section in question, which was not enacted till 19121, can be regarded as incorporated in the local Act of 1911. It was not part of the Land Acquisition Act when the loc<.ll Act was passed, nor in adopting the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act is there anythi;ng to suggest that the Bengal Legislature intended to bind themselves to any future addi- tions which might be made to that Act. It is at least con- ceivable that new provisions might have been added to the Land Acqui,;ition Act which would be wholly unsuitable to the local code. Nor, again, does Act XIX. of 1921 contain any provision that the amendments enacted by it are to be treated as in any way retrospective, or are to be regarded as affecting any other enactment than the Lan cl Acquisition Act itself. Their Lordships regard the local Act as doing nothing more than incorporating certain provisions frgm an existing Act, and for convenience of drafting doing so by reference to that Act, instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it was desired to adopt . .

This doctrine finds expression in a comµion- orm Socruv. section which regularly appears in the amending and repealing Acts which are passed from time to time in India. The section runs : \" The repeal by this Act of any enact- ment shall not affect any Act . in which such enact- ment has been applied, incorporated or referred t:).\" The independent existence of the two Acts is therefore recog,.. nized ; despite the death of the parent Act, its offspring survives in the incorporating Act. Though no such saving clause appears in the General Clauses Act, their Lordships think that the principle involved is as applicable in India as it is in this country. It seems to be no less logical to hold that where certain provisions from an existing Act have been incorporated into a subsequent Act, no addition to the former Act, which is not expressly made applicable to the subsequent Act, can be deemed to be incorporated in it, at all events if it is possible for the subsequent Act to function effectually with- out the addition. So Lord Westbury says in Ex parte St. Sepulchre's (I) : \" If the particular Act gives in itself a com- plete rule on the subject-matter, the expression of that rule would undoubte -lly amount to an exception of the subject- matter of the rule out of the general Act \": see a]so London, Chatham and Dover Ry.

Many such appeals had been preferred and determined by this Board, and the right had then never been questioned. The deliberate exclusion of s. 54 from the local Act was an indication of the Local Legislature's intention that there ehould be under the special code applicable to the Improvement Trust not only no unrestricted right of appeal to the High Court, but no appeal at all beyond the High Court, and this, their Lordships think, found expression in the words of s. 71 (d). If, therefore, as is contended on behalf of the Secretary of State, the introduction into the local Act of the new s. 26, sub-s. 2, of the L:md Acqui~ition Act, were to give the right of appeal to His Majesty in Council, which is claimed in the present case, it would, in their Lordships' op1rJ10n, be clearly repugnant to the provisions of the local code. Even if their Lordships had been forced to hold that the sub- section was incorporated in the local Act, they would, on the well-recognized principle of generalia specialibus non derogant, have come to the conclusion that the provision of the local code must prevail and that this appeal was barred. Their Lordships also think it right to point out that, even if the award of the Tribunal were deemed to be a decree, that would not of itself be sufficient to give a right of appeal to His Majesty in Council.

The question of competency was discussed on the application of the Secretary of State in the p1·esent case for the necessary certificate, and in granting it the learned judges thought it proper merely to follow a previous decision of the High Court in which, in a similar case, it had been held by Sir Lancelot Sanderson, then Chief Justice of Bengal, with the concurrence of Walmesley J., that an appeal lay to His Majesty in Council. When that case 'came before the Board (Secretary of State for India v. Tara/c Chandra Sadhukan (1) ), the question of competency was again raised, but it was not found necessary to decide it, the appeal being dismissed upon other grounds. The judgment of the learned Chief Justice proceeded upon the ground that s. 26: sub-s. 2, of the Land Acquisition Act, as amended by Act XVIII. of 1921, should be read as part of the Improvment Trust Act of 19II ; that the award of the Tribunal was thereby constituted a decree from which an appeal lay to the High Court, and that from the decree of the High Court an appeal lay to His Majesty in Council.
