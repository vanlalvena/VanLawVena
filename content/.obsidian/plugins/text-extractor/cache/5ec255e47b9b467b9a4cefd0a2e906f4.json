The trial courts were closed on account of winter/Christmas vacations from 19-12-2016 to 1-1-2017. However, it so happened that extendable/condonable period of 30 days as contemplated in the proviso to Section 34(3) expired on 24-12-2016 on which day the trial court was closed on account of winter/ Christmas vacation. The appellant herein filed the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, challenging the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal. The appellant also filed intervention application for condonation of delay. Both, Section 34 of the 1996 Act application as well as the application for condonation of delay were filed on the reopening day i.e. on 2-1-2017. As the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was beyond the prescribed period provided under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act as well as beyond the condonable period of 30 days, the trial court dismissed intervention application and refused to condone the delay by recording finding that the period beyond three months plus thirty days is not condonable as under the Arbitration Act, maximum period provided for preferring an application under Section 34 is three months plus thirty days. Before the High Court, Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 were pressed into service. By the impugned judgment and order the High Court dismissed the said appeal by recording the finding that the expression \"prescribed period\" appearing in Section 4 of the Limitation Act cannot be construed to mean anything other than the period of limitation and therefore, any period beyond the prescribed period, during which the Court or Tribunal has the discretion to allow a person to institute the proceeding, cannot be taken to be \"prescribed period\". Thus, the present appeal in the Supreme Court. The appellant contended that the present case reflects an anomalous situation where Section 4 of the Limitation Act, which only deals with the period of limitation prescribed under the Limitation Act, leaves a vacuum as far as statutory condonable period is concerned. In the case of such statutory condonable periods, Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which is much wider in its import and applicability, and embodies the same legal principle, must necessarily step in to fill the vacuum . The appellant contended that every consideration of justice and expediency would require that the accepted principle which underlines Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 should be applied in cases where it does not otherwise in terms apply. Further it was contended by the applicant that the litigant has a right to avail limitation up to the last day and his only obligation is to explain his inability to present the suit/petition on the last day of limitation and each day thereafter till it is actually presented. The appellant also contended that reference to Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 in Sagufa Ahmed, (2021) 2 SCC 317 is tangential at best. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The period of 30 days mentioned in the proviso that follows sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is not the \"period of limitation\" and, therefore, not the \"prescribed period\" for the purposes of making the application for setting aside the arbitral award. The period of 30 days beyond three months which the court may extend on sufficient cause being shown under the proviso appended to sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act being not the \"period of limitation\" or, in other words, the \"prescribed period\", Section 4 of the 1963 Act is not, at all, attracted to the facts of the present case. (Paras 51 and 52) Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the appellant that the Limitation Act shall not be applicable to the proceedings under the Arbitration Act is concerned, the aforesaid has no substance. Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act specifically provides that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceeding in Court. However, as observed and held by the Supreme Court in Assam Urban, (2012) 2 SCC 624, the Limitation Act, 1963 shall be applicable to the matters of arbitration covered by the 1996 Act save and except to the extent its applicability has been excluded by virtue of express provision contained in Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. (Paras 54 to 56) Now, so far as reliance placed upon Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 on behalf of the appellant is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that such a contention is untenable in light of the proviso to Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which specifically excludes the application of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 to any act or proceeding to which the Limitation Act, 1877 applies. Reference to the 1877 Act will now have to be read as reference to the Limitation Act, 1963 in view of Section 8 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. (Para 57) Therefore, in light of the application of the Limitation Act, 1963 to the proceedings under the Arbitration Act and when Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 specifically excludes the applicability of Section 10 to any act or proceeding to which the Limitation Act, 1963 applies and in light of the definition of \"period of limitation\" as defined under Section 2(}) read with Section 4 of the Limitation Act and as observed and held by the Supreme Court in Assam Urban case, benefit of exclusion of period during which the Court is closed shall be available when the application for setting aside award is filed within \"prescribed period of limitation\" and shall not be available in respect of period extendable by Court in exercise of its discretion.

SHAH, J.- Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 23-2-20221 passed by the High Court of Karnataka, a at Kalaburagi in Misc. First Appeal No. 201018 of 2018 by which the High Court has dismissed the said appeal and has confirmed the order dated 2-4-2018 passed by the learned Hird Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vijayapur (hereinafter referred to as \"the trial court\") in rejecting the application for condonation of delay caused in preferring the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the b Arbitration Act\"), the original applicant has preferred the present appeal. 2. The brief facts leading to filing of the present appeal in a nutshell are as under. 3. That, an arbitral award was passed against the appellant under the provisions of the Arbitration Act on 24-8-2016. As per Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act, 90 days are prescribed for preferring an application under c Section 34 of the Arbitration Act against the arbitral award. However, the said period was extendable by a further period of 30 days in terms of the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Act, 2016. In the present case, the period of 90 days prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act expired on 24-11-2016. The appellant was entitled to a further extended period of 30 days d from 23-11-2016 onwards in terms of the proviso to Section 34(3) which was up to 24-12-2016. 4. The trial courts were closed on account of winter/Christmas vacations from 19-12-2016 to 1-1-2017. However, it so happened that extendable/ condonable period of 30 days as contemplated in the proviso to Section 34(3) expired on 24-12-2016 on which day the trial court was closed on account of winter/Christmas vacation. The appellant herein filed the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, challenging the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal. The appellant also filed IA No. 1 for condonation of delay. Both, Section 34 application as well as the application for condonation of delay were filed on the reopening day i.e. on 2-1-2017. As the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was beyond the prescribed period of provided under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act as well as beyond the condonable period of 30 days, the learned trial court dismissed IA No. 1 and refused to condone the delay by observing that the period beyond 120 days is not condonable as under the Arbitration Act, maximum period provided for preferring an application under Section 34 is 120 days. 5. At this stage it is required to be noted that in the affidavit filed by the appellant before the High Court, filed in support of IA No. 1, the appellant as such admitted that it received the copy of the award on 24-8-2016. However, according to the appellant, the said award was misplaced and thereafter obtained a fresh copy on 29-12-2016.

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by the learned trial court refusing to condone the delay in preferring application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, the appellant herein preferred an appeal before the High Court. 7. Before the High Court, Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 were pressed into service. By the impugned judgment and order the High Court has dismissed 1 the said appeal by observing that the expression \"prescribed period\" appearing in Section 4 of the Limitation Act cannot be construed to mean anything other than the period of limitation and therefore, any period beyond the prescribed period, during which the Court or Tribunal has the discretion to allow a person to institute the proceeding, cannot be taken to be \"prescribed period\". 8. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order1 passed by the High Court, the original applicant has preferred the present appeal. 9. Shri Shyam Diwan, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant and Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the contesting respondent. 10. Shri Shyam Diwan, learned counsel has submitted that Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act specifies that the limitation period for filing an application for setting aside the arbitral award under Section 34 is three months from the date on which the party making application has received the award. However, if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months, the proviso to the Section specifies a further period of 30 days within which the application under Section 34 may be filed/entertained. 11. It is submitted that the central question in the present petition is whether when the last day of condonable period of 30 days falls on a holiday or during a court vacation, would the benefit of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 would be available to the appellant? 12. It is submitted that in other words, can the appellant-petitioner file the application on the next date when the Court reopens, in line with the settled principle that the law does not compel a person to do an impossible act. It is submitted that in the present case the appellant-petitioner had filed the application under Section 34 on the very day when the Court reopened. 13. It is submitted by Shri Shyam Diwan, learned Senior Counsel that not extending the benefit of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act to the appellant in such circumstances leads to an anomalous situation wherein the benefit of statutorily prescribed condonable period is cut short for some persons due to l Bhimashankar Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane Niyamita v.

It is submitted that this creates uncertainty and unpredictability in the application of provision in question. 14. It is submitted that the present case reflects an anomalous situation where Section 4 of the Limitation Act, which only deals with the period of limitation prescribed under the Limitation Act, leaves a vacuum as far as statutory condonable period is concerned. It is submitted that the judgment in Assam Urban Water Supply & Sewerage Board v. Subash Projects & Mktg. Ltd. 2 failed to take into account that in the case of such statutory condonable periods, Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which is much wider in its import and applicability, and embodies the same legal principle, must necessarily step in to fill the vacuum. 15. It is submitted that while passing the impugned judgment and order1, the High Court has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court in Assam Urban 2 while holding that the term \"prescribed period\" referred to in Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963 only includes the limitation period and not the 30- day condonable/grace period. It is submitted that however the case of Assam Urban 2 does not notice or deal with Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. It only notices and deals with Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and holds that the term \"prescribed period\" mentioned in Section 4 means the period of limitation. It is submitted that the judgment in Assam Urban 2 fails to notice that Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963 which deals with the period of limitation prescribed under the Limitation Act, 1963, leaves a vacuum as far as the statutory condonable period is concerned. 16. It is submitted that in failing to notice Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the judgment in Assam Urban 2 disregards the principle embodied in the General Clauses Act which is much wider in its import and applicability and must necessarily step in to fill the vacuum left by Section 4 of the Limitation Act. 17. It is further submitted by Shri Diwan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant that although the same general principle of \"elementary justice\" is embodied in both Sections of the two Acts, there is a crucial distinction between the Limitation Act, 1963 and the General Clauses Act, 1897. 18. It is submitted that Section 2(j) of the Limitation Act defines \"period of limitation\". It is submitted that thus, while the term \"prescribed period\" has a narrower meaning in the context of the Limitation Act, there is no such restrictive definition clause in the General Clauses Act. It is submitted that in fact, the scheme of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act is clear from a bare perusal of the provision and indicates that there are two prescribed periods in this Section viz. (1) the prescribed period within which something is directed 2 (2012) 2 sec 624: (2012) 1 sec (Civ) 831 l Bhimashankar Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane Niyamita v.

It is submitted that therefore, reading of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 makes it clear that the period in which something is allowed to be done, such as 30 days' condonable period provided by the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act is also a prescribed period within the meaning of the General Clauses Act, 1897. 20. It is further submitted by Shri Shyam Diwan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the principle embodied in Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is an elementary piece of justice. It is submitted that the 60th Law Commission Report on the General Clauses Act reiterated the parliamentary intention behind the Act and the provision, which is to deliver elementary justice. 21. It is submitted that in HUDA v. Babeswar Kanhar3, this Court has observed and held that every consideration of justice and expediency would require that the accepted principle which underlines Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 should be applied in cases where it does not otherwise in terms apply. It is observed that the principles underlying are lex non cogit ad impossibilia (law does not compel a man to do the impossible) and actus curiae neminem gravabit (the act of court shall prejudice no man). It is submitted that in Manohar Joshi v. Nitin Bhaurao Patil4, it is observed and held by this Court that the litigant has a right to avail limitation up to the last day and his only obligation is to explain his inability to present the suit/petition on the last day of limitation and each day thereafter till it is actually presented. 22. It is further submitted that if as held in Assam Urban 2 , the benefit of Section 4 of the Limitation Act is only available for the period of limitation and is not available for the statutorily granted condonable period. Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 must step in to fill the vacuum. It is submitted that any contrary view would deny individuals the full play of the statutory period of 30 days for condonation of delay. 23. Now, so far as the contention on behalf of the respondent that present proceeding is \"any Act or proceeding to which the Limitation Act applies\" is a misconceived argument is concerned, it is submitted that the respondents have sought to rely on the proviso to Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Relying upon Section 43( 1) of the Arbitration Act to contend that the Limitation Act applies to the present proceedings, it is submitted that Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act merely states that \"the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in Court\". It is submitted that this cannot be interpreted to mean that the Limitation Act, in its entirety applies to proceeding under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and that the present 3 (2005) 1 sec 191 4 (1996) 1 sec 169 2 Assam Urban Water Supply & Sewerage Board v.

It is submitted that in fact, in matters of limitation, Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is a complete code. It is submitted that the respondent's entire case, on a one hand, is that the benefit of the Limitation Act, particularly Section 4 of the Limitation Act, cannot be given to the condonable period in the instant case. It is submitted that therefore on one hand, the respondent is arguing that the benefit of Section 4 of the Limitation Act, as well as Section 5 of the Limitation Act has no application to the condonable period under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act i.e. the Limitation Act has no application in the present proceedings, at b the same time, the respondent is contending that the benefit of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 cannot be given to the appellant, as the present proceeding falls within the ambit of the phrase \"any act or proceeding to which the Limitation Act, 1877, applies\". 24. It is further submitted by Shri Diwan, learned Senior Counsel that the reliance placed on Sag ufa Ahmed v. Upper Assam Polywood Products ( P) Ltd. 5 c is misconceived for the following two reasons: 24.1. The reference to Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 in Sagufa Ahmed5 is tangential at best. 24.2. The facts of Sagufa Ahmed5 are clearly distinguishable from the case at hand. In that case, the appellants had waited 5 months after the discretionary period had expired to file an appeal against the order6 of the learned NCLT. In the present case, there was no undue delay on the part of the petitioner-appellant herein. The appellant-petitioner filed the petition under Section 34 of the very day of the reopening of the learned court. 25. It is submitted that this Court in its order dated 8-3-2021 in Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In re 7, has put a quietus to the artificial distinction between the \"limitation period\" and \"grace period\", wherein it extended the benefit of exemption due to Covrn-19 to the limitation period as well as the condonable period. 26. It is further submitted by Shri Diwan, learned Senior Counsel that the aim and object of the limitation period and statutory grace period/condonable period provided in the Arbitration Act is to ensure that parties who sleep over their rights and come to the court belatedly are not allowed to upset the apple cart. It is submitted that in the present instance, the appellant has been nothing but diligent and approached the learned trial court on the very day of reopening. It is submitted that Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 has been enacted to address precisely this kind of a situation and merely because the benefit of Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963 is unavailable in a case, should not ipso facto exclude the application of the General Clauses Act, 1897. 27. It is submitted that the appellant is an agriculturists' society, and despite having suffered losses due to non-fulfilment of their obligations by the respondent, the appellant's case has never been heard on merits.

Shah, J.) that therefore non-suiting the appellant in the present instance and denying the benefit of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (with the elementary rule of justice captured in it) will cause a grave miscarriage of justice. 28. Making above submissions, it is prayed to set aside the order passed by the learned trial court as well as the High Court and to condone the delay caused in preferring application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and to direct the learned trial court to hear the application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act on merits by giving the appellant an opportunity to put forth its case on merits. 29. Present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent. 30. It is submitted that in the present case the appellant admittedly received the award on 24-8-2016. As per Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, \"the prescribed period\" of 3 months to challenge the award expired on 24-11-2016 and further period of 30 days under the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act expired on 24-12-2016. That, the learned trial court was on winter vacation between 19-12-2016 to 1-1-2017. The appellant preferred its application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the learned trial court on 2-1-2017 i.e. on the day of reopening, accompanied by an application seeking condonation of delay. It is submitted that the learned trial court after considering both, the maintainability and merits of the appellant's application for condonation, has found that the application was not maintainable and also that no sufficient cause had been shown by the appellant. It is submitted that the High Court has upheld the order of the trial court that the petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was not maintainable for being beyond the \"prescribed period\" under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. 31. It is submitted that therefore the following questions arise for consideration in the present case: 31.1. Whether the benefit of Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963 is available to a party when the \"prescribed period\" of 3 months for filing a petition under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act has already expired and the discretionary period of 30 days under the proviso to Section 34(3) falls on a day when the Court is closed? 31.2. Whether the benefit of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is separately available to a party in such circumstances? 32. Now, so far as the applicability of Section 4 of the Limitation Act is concerned, it is vehemently submitted by Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel that Section 4 of the Limitation Act shall not be applicable to the 30 days' discretionary condonable period contemplated under the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. It is submitted that Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act stipulates that an application under Section 34(1) of the Arbitration Act challenging an arbitral award may not be made after a period of three months from the date on which the party making the application had received the arbitral award.

It is submitted that in Union of India v. Popular Construction Co. 8 (paras 10, 12, 14 and 16), this Court has observed that usage of words \"but not thereafter\" in the proviso to Section 34(3) amounts to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act. Therefore, the Court would have no discretion to condone the delay in excess of 30 days. Section 5 of the Limitation Act was, therefore, held to be inapplicable to Section 34( 1) of the Arbitration Act. 33. It is submitted that Section 4 of the Limitation Act is only applicable when the last date of the \"prescribed period\" falls on a day on which the Court is closed. It is submitted that the term, \"prescribed period\" is defined in Section 2(j) of the Limitation Act as being the period of limitation computed in accordance with the provisions of the Limitation Act. 34. It is submitted that this Court in Assam Urban2 (paras 10 to 14) has held that \"prescribed period\" under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act is three months. It is submitted that \"further period\" of 30 days mentioned in the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act cannot be said to be the \"period of limitation\" and therefore, would not be the \"prescribed period\" for the purposes of making an application for setting aside the arbitral award. It is submitted that thus, in the said decision, this Court has categorically held that Section 4 of the Limitation Act which applies only to \"prescribed period\" is not attracted when the last date of the \"further period\" of 30 days mentioned in Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act falls on a day on which the Court is closed. It is submitted that the facts of the case in Assam Urban 2 are identical to the facts of the present case. It is submitted that decision of this Court in Assam Urban2 has been affirmed by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in SagufaAhmed5 (paras 20-22). 35. It is further submitted by Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel that the correct application of Section 4 of the Limitation Act will result in a petition being entertained as a matter of right, without a party having to seek condonation of delay, since it applies only to petitions that would otherwise be within the \"prescribed period\" but its presentation within this period has been prevented due to closure of the Court. However, on the other hand, this cannot apply to a delayed petition where, in any event, the right to present the petition is subject to sufficient cause being shown and condonation of delay being sought. 36. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the appellant that the judgment in Sagufa Ahmed5 is not a good law or is distinguishable is concerned, it is submitted that as such the decision in Sagufa Ahmed5 lays down the correct law and shall be applicable with full force on interpretation of \"to condone delay within further period\". s (2001) s sec 470 2 Assam Urban Water Supply & Sewerage Board v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h BHIMASHANKAR SAHAKARI SAKKARE KARKHANE NIYAMITA v. 465 WALCHANDNAGARINDUSTRIES LTD. (M.R. Shah, J.) 37. It is submitted that the judgment in Sagufa Ahmed5, was in the context of Section 421(3) of the Companies Act, 2013, which provides a prescribed period of 45 days for filing an appeal, and empowers the Appellate Tribunal to condone the delay within \"further period\" not exceeding 45 days. A three-Judge Bench of this Court rejected the contention of the appellants therein that the benefit of the order of this Court dated 23-3-2020 in Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In re9 , is extendable to them, by holding that under the order dated 23-3-20209, what was extended was only \"the period of limitation\" and not the period up to which delay can be condoned in exercise of discretion conferred by the statute. 38. It is submitted that thus, in Sagufa Ahmed5, this Court while affirming Assam Urban 2 has held that the expression \"prescribed period\" appearing in Section 4 of the Limitation Act cannot be construed to mean anything other than the period of limitation. Any period beyond the \"prescribed period\" during which the Court or Tribunal has the discretion to allow a person to institute the proceedings cannot be taken to be \"prescribed period\". 39. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the appellant that the judgment in Assam Urban 2 has the effect of denying the parties to right to file their application for condonation in situation where the discretionary period expires during vacation and that such interpretation was incorrect inasmuch as it leaves parties at the mercy of \"fortuitous circumstance\", it is submitted that such a submission is not tenable. It is submitted that the court vacations are notified well in advance and would not account to a fortuitous circumstance as alleged. It is submitted that on the date of receipt of award, the party would be well aware of the limitation period under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act and ought to diligently secure its right. It is submitted that in the present case, having received the award on 24-8-2016, the appellant had a further period of 25 days after expiry of \"prescribed period\" and before commencement of the winter vacation of the trial court. However, the appellant-petitioner chose not to file its petition during this time and therefore, has to suffer for the inevitable consequences. 40. It is further submitted that right under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is a restricted right to challenge an award on extremely limited ground. The proviso to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act further excludes the general power of the Court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act and imposes a strict timeline for presentation of a petition under Section 34. In such circumstances, acceptance of the appellant's argument will have the effect of providing an unduly enlarged time period (beyond the statutory 30-day discretionary period) 5 Sagufa Ahmed v.

Now, so far as the applicability of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 as per the case of the appellant is concerned, it is vehemently submitted that as such the contention is untenable in light of the proviso to Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which specifically excludes the application of this section to any Act or proceeding to which the Limitation Act applies. It is submitted that reference to the 1877 Act will now have to be read as reference to the Limitation Act, 1963 in view of Section 8 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. It is submitted that it is no longer res integra that the Limitation Act, 1963 applies to arbitrations and court proceedings arising out of the arbitrations in light of Section 41(3) of the Arbitration Act. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in State of M aharashtra v. Borse Bros. Engineers & Contractors ( P) Ltd. 10 and Consolidated Eng g. Enterprises v. Irrigation Deptt. 11 It is submitted that therefore in light of the application of the Limitation Act, 1963 applicable to the proceedings under the Arbitration Act (both in Court and in arbitration), Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is specifically excluded, and therefore, cannot be relied upon by the appellant. 42. It is submitted that even otherwise this Court in SagufaAhmed5 has held that the principle forming the basis of Section 10( 1) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 also finds a place in Section 4 of the Limitation Act. Therefore, when the benefit of Section 4 of the Limitation Act is not available, the appellant cannot seek to take recourse to Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which embodies the same principle. 43. It is further submitted that just like Section 4 of the Limitation Act, Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 also uses the term \"prescribed period\". Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 provides that where any act is directed to be done on a certain day, or any proceeding is allowed to be done in any Court or office within prescribed period, if the Court or office is closed on that certain day, or the last day of the prescribed period, it may be done or taken on the next working day. Accordingly, if Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 was to be applicable, the term \"prescribed period\" must be given the same meaning as that in the Limitation Act. Thus, Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 will also only then apply for the prescribed period of three months under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act and not to the discretionary period of 30 days under the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. 10 (2021) 6 sec 460 : (2021) 3 sec (Civ) 649 11 (2008) 7 sec 169 5 Sagufa Ahmed v.

Making above submissions and relying upon the decision of this Court in Assam Urban2 and SagufaAhmed5, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal. 45. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties, a short question which is posed for consideration of this Court is whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned trial court was justified in not condoning the delay in preferring the application under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act, which was filed after the expiry of 120 days but filed on the first day of reopening after the winter/Christmas vacation and in a case where the condonable period of 30 days under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act had fallen during the winter/Christmas vacation? The question is with respect to the applicability of Section 4 of the Limitation Act and Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 in the facts and circumstances of the case. 46. Therefore, the central question in the present appeal is whether when the last day of condonable period of 30 days [under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act] falls on a holiday or during the court vacation, would the benefit of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 be available? 47. While considering the aforesaid issues/questions, Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is required to be referred to, which reads as under: \"34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.-(1)-(2) * * * (3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under Section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the Arbitral Tribunal: Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.\" 48. The relevant provisions of the Limitation Act and the General Clauses Act, 1897 are also required to be referred to which are as under: \"2.

Shah, J.) application for setting aside the award after the period of three months and within a further period of 30 days but not thereafter. 7. In Popular Construction Co. 8, this Court has held that an application for setting aside an award filed beyond the period mentioned in Section 34(3) would not be an application 'in accordance with sub-section (3) as required under Section 34(1) of the 1996 Act' and Section 5 of the 1963 Act has no application to such application. In para 12 of the Report, it was held in Popular Construction Co. 8 thus: (SCC pp. 474-75) '12. As far as the language of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial words are \"but not thereafter\" used in the proviso to sub-section (3). In our opinion, this phrase would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and would therefore bar the application of Section 5 of that Act. Parliament did not need to go further. To hold that the court could entertain an application to set aside the award beyond the extended period under the proviso, would render the phrase \"but not thereafter\" wholly otiose. No principle of interpretation would justify such a result.' 8. Recently, in State of Maharashtra v. Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. 12, a two-Judge Bench of this Court speaking through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) emphasised the mandatory nature of the limit to the extension of the period provided in the proviso to Section 34(3) and held that an application for setting aside an arbitral award under Section 34 of the 1996 Act has to be made within the time prescribed under sub-section (3) of Section 34 i.e. within three months and a further period of 30 days on sufficient cause being shown and not thereafter. 9. Section 43( 1) of the 1996 Act provides that the 1963 Act shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court. The 1963 Act is thus applicable to the matters of arbitration covered by the 1996 Act save and except to the extent its applicability has been excluded by virtue of the express provision contained in Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act.\" 52. Before this Court there existed, similar facts like in the present case. In the case before this Court, the arbitral awards were received by the appellants on 26-8-2003. No application for setting aside the arbitral award was made before elapse of three months from the receipt thereof. Three months from the date of receipt of the award expired on 26-11-2003. The District Court had Christmas vacation for the period from 25-12-2003 to 1-1-2004. On reopening of the Court i.e. on 2-1-2004, the appellants made application for setting aside the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. Considering the aforesaid facts and thereafter considering Sections 2(j) and 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963, 8 Union of India v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 470 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) s sec this Court observed and held and concluded in paras 11 to 15 as under: (Assam Urban case2 , SCC pp. 627-28) \"11. The question, therefore, that falls for our determination is whether the appellants are entitled to extension of time under Section 4 of the 1963 Act in the above facts? 12. Section 4 of the 1963 Act reads as under: '4. Expiry of prescribed period when court is closed.-Where the prescribed period for any suit, appeal or application expires on a day when the court is closed, the suit, appeal or application may be instituted, preferred or made on the day when the court reopens. Explanation.-A court shall be deemed to be closed on any day within the meaning of this section if during any part of its normal working hours it remains closed on that day.' The above Section enables a party to institute a suit, prefer an appeal or make an application on the day the court reopens where the prescribed period for any suit, appeal or application expires on the day when the court is closed. 13. The crucial words in Section 4 of the 1963 Act are \"prescribed period\". What is the meaning of these words? 14. Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act defines: '2. (j) \"period of limitation\" [which] means the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by the Schedule, and \"prescribed period\" means the period of limitation computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act.' a b C d Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act when read in the context of Section 34(3) of the e 1996 Act, it becomes amply clear that the prescribed period for making an application for setting aside an arbitral award is three months. The period of 30 days mentioned in the proviso that follows sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is not the \"period of limitation\" and, therefore, not the \"prescribed period\" for the purposes of making the application for setting aside the arbitral award. The period of 30 days beyond three months which f the court may extend on sufficient cause being shown under the proviso appended to sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act being not the \"period of limitation\" or, in other words, the \"prescribed period\", in our opinion, Section 4 of the 1963 Act is not, at all, attracted to the facts of the present case. 15. Seen thus, the applications made by the appellants on 2-1-2004 for g setting aside the arbitral award dated 26-8-2003 were liable to be dismissed and have rightly been dismissed by the District Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati, as time-barred.\" 2 Assam Urban Water Supply & Sewerage Board v.

Therefore, as such the question involved in the present appeal is squarely answered against the appellant and the said issue is as such not res integra. 54. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the appellant that the Limitation Act shall not be applicable to the proceedings under the Arbitration Act is concerned, the aforesaid has no substance. Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act specifically provides that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceeding in Court. However, as observed and held by this Court in Assam Urban 2 , the Limitation Act, 1963 shall be applicable to the matters of arbitration covered by the 1996 Act save and except to the extent its applicability has been excluded by virtue of express provision contained in Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. 55. In Popular Construction Co. 8, when Section 5 of the Limitation Act was pressed into service to proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act for setting aside the arbitral award, this Court has observed that the Arbitration Act being a special law and provides a period of limitation different from that prescribed under the Limitation Act, the period of limitation prescribed under the Arbitration Act shall prevail and shall be applicable and to that extent the Limitation Act shall be excluded. That, thereafter, it is observed and held that application challenging an award filed beyond period mentioned in Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act would not be an application \"in accordance with\" sub-section (3) as required under Section 34(1) of the Arbitration Act. 56. In Hindustan Construction Co. 12, in fact this Court has emphasised the mandatory nature of limit to the extension of period provided in the proviso to Section 34(3) and has held that an application for setting aside an arbitral award under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act has to be made within time prescribed under sub-section (3) of Section 34 i.e. within three months and a further period of 30 days on sufficient cause being shown and not thereafter. 57. Now, so far as reliance placed upon Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 on behalf of the appellant is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that such a contention is untenable in light of the proviso to Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which specifically excludes the application of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 to any act or proceeding to which the Limitation Act, 1877 applies. Reference to the 1877 Act will now have to be read as reference to the Limitation Act, 1963 in view of Section 8 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. 2 Assam Urban Water Supply & Sewerage Board v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 472 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) s sec 58. Therefore, in light of the application of the Limitation Act, 1963 to the proceedings under the Arbitration Act and when Section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 specifically excludes the applicability of Section 10 to any act or proceeding to which Limitation Act, 1963 applies and in light of the definition of \"period of limitation\" as defined under Section 2U) read with Section 4 of the Limitation Act and as observed and held by this Court in Assam Urban 2 , benefit of exclusion of period during which the Court is closed shall be available when the application for setting aside award is filed within \"prescribed period of limitation\" and shall not be available in respect of period extendable by Court in exercise of its discretion. 59. Now, so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of this Court in Sridevi Datla v. Union of India 13 relied upon on behalf of the appellant is concerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that in the said decision, this Court has not noticed the decision in Assam Urban 2 and there is no discussion on distinction between \"prescribed period\" and the \"discretionary condonable period\". On the other hand, the binding decision of this Court in Assam Urban2 is directly on point. 60. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, applying the law laid down by this Court in Assam Urban 2 , it cannot be said that the High Court and the learned IIIrd Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vijaypur have committed any error in refusing to condone the delay caused in preferring application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which was beyond the period prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 61. Under the circumstances, the present appeal deserves to be dismissed and is, accordingly, dismissed. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. a b C d e f g 2 Assam Urban Water Supply & Sewerage Board v. Subash Projects & Mktg.
