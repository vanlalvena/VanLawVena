Administrative Law - Legitimate Expectation - Instances of Reregistration application dated 9-5-2012 submitted under amended copyright law sought to be withdrawn on 20-5-2014 with intention to file fresh application for registration - Petitioner informed vide d letter dated 20-11-2014 that its reregistration application was still under consideration - Withdrawal not allowed - Subsequently, petitioner filed fresh registration application dated 11-1-2018 - Later on, cryptic order dated 25-5-2021 passed treating reregistration application dated 9-5-2012 having been withdrawn and treating fresh application 11-1-2018 as belated - Held, petitioner had a legitimate expectation when it is told that its e reregistration was still pending - Withdrawal application could not quoted against the petitioner - Doctrine of election could not also be quoted against the petitioner though fresh application was submitted in 2018 because of the understanding given to the petitioner in November 2014 that its reregistration was still pending Allowing the applications, the High Court of Delhi f Held: The petitioner had a legitimate expectation about pendency of its application and Government's intention to reregister it. (Para 28) What prompted the petitioner to move an application for withdrawal is not an issue at this stage and secondly one need only to examine how the petitioner was g made to believe its application was under process and was being examined. The petitioner had applied for the copyright society reregistration immediately after the introduction of the copyright amendment. It was working as an owner because its application for reregistration was pending. The petitioner did not choose or elected itself to work as an owner of the copyright and not as a society, but it was because of the circumstances explained. (Para 30) h B.

UNION OF INDIA 609 of hearing and reasoned order - Held, registrar is a quasi-judicial body - When it belatedly rejected petitioner's reregistration application paving the way for registration of a competing society, it entailed civil consequences - Opportunity of hearing ought to have been given to the petitioner Society - Impugned order ought to have been reasoned - Far-reaching implications on the petitioner-Society had not been properly considered - On facts also found that the impugned order even ignored the court order already passed - Held, impugned order was unsustainable in law because it suffered from non- application of mind to all relevant facts - Copyright Act, 1957 - S. 33(3-A) Held : Where the petitioner was a registered society prior to the amendment and where its application for reregistration was in process, Respondent 1, being a quasi- judicial authority, ought to have given the petitioner an opportunity of being heard, especially in circumstances of this case. (Para 31) Principles of natural justice would apply only to cases of fresh registrations and not to applications for reregistration. There is no separate rule for hearing on applications for reregistration. Rule 49 of the Copyright Rules, 2013 stipulates the condition only for registration but it is equally true if an application for reregistration is rejected to pave way to register another society, this principle ought to be read in to Rule 4 7 and applies to applications for reregistration. The certificate granted to the Indian Performing Right Society (IPRS) on its application for reregistration too is under Rule 49 . (Para 32) There is sheer non-application of mind by the competent authority in rejecting the petitioner' s application without giving an opportunity of being heard to it. Respondent 1 rather failed to decide the application on merits and dismissed it on the premise the petitioner filed fresh application only in June 2018. This is incorrect as the June 2018 application was not in Form IX. It was rather the petitioner's letter to comply with issues involved. The impugned order is silent qua the correspondences exchanged between petitioner and Respondent 1 and to an office memorandum dated 6-10-2016 which rather declared the application was well within time. (Para 33) Before passing the impugned order, Respondent 1 ought to have considered, (a) rejection of the application of withdrawal; (b) the office memorandum of2016; and (c) correspondences between the year 2014 till 2018 revealing the petitioner's application was being processed at the end of the Government and was alive lest there was no reason for petitioner to correspond with the Government. These facts do not find mention in the impugned order. The impugned order is bad in law. (Para 34) Respondent 1, while granting the registration to the RMPL Respondent 2, had ignored the order passed WP No. 21 of 2021, wherein the court while granting the ad interim stay to the petitioner, clarified that Respondent 1 Government should keep in mind that in case the petitioner succeeded in the present writ petition, its 2013 reregistration application would stand revived, and directed Respondent 1 to not take any steps inconsistent with this position during the pendency of the writ petition.

(Para 37) If Respondent 2 RMPL registration is not set-aside, the same would irreversibly prejudice the petitioner's chances for registration as a copyright society, unless the Government considers giving registration to two societies though, per Rule 49, the registration of another copyright society for the same class of works is an express ground for rejection of a subsequent application. (Para 38) The Respondent 1, after failing to act upon the petitioner's application for reregistration as a copyright society for 9 years and the respondent RMPL's application for registration as a copyright society for 3 years, proceeded in haste to register Respondent 2 as a copyright society within 15 days of the interim order passed in the first writ petition. There was no reason for Respondent 1 to grant the impugned registration to Respondent 2 in such a hurry. (Para 39) If the first writ petition is allowed, the second writ petition would have to be allowed as a corollary, or in view of the order dated 2-6-2021 passed by the court in WP (C)-IPD 21 of 2021, if the said writ petition is allowed, the petitioner's application for reregistration would stand revived, and hence the order granting RMPL registration as a copyright society would have to be set aside as RMPL's application for registration was subsequent in time to the petitioner's application. (Para 40) Impugned orders dated 25-5-2021 and 18-6-2021 both are set aside. Respondent 1 is directed to reconsider the petitioner's application for reregistration on merits, as being filed in time.

(ii) Direct Respondents 1 and 3 to produce all records in relation to the grant of the impugned registration to Respondent 2. 2. Both these petitions are being disposed of by this common order. 3. The petitioner \"Phonographic Performance Limited\", a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956, (hereinafter referred as \"PPL\") was a registered copyright society till the introduction of an amendment in the Copyright Act in the year 2012. It introduced Section 33(3-A) mandating \"every copyright society already registered before the coming into force of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 2012 shall get itself registered under this chapter within a period of one year from the date of commencement of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 2012\" . 4. The petitioner being a copyright society was assigned copyright in various sound recordings for communication to public in the areas of public performance and broadcast. The petitioner owned and/or controlled the public performance rights of 350+ music companies, with more than 3 million international and domestic sound recordings; being an oldest and the largest copyright society in the country. The petitioner represented about 80-90% of sound recordings ever created in the country. The petitioner served a useful public utility of acting as a \"single window\" to various parties seeking licence for authorised use of sound recordings and bring together the copyright owners and users across various parts of India for better convenience and better administration. 5. In the year 2012, the legal framework regarding copyright societies underwent a sea change and the amended provisions of the Copyright Act, especially Section 33(3-A), required the existing copyright societies, such as the petitioner, to compulsorily reregister themselves under the amended provisions within a period of one year from the date of commencement of Copyright (Amendment) Act, 2012. 6. On 14-3-2013, the Copyright Rules, 2013 were introduced, wherein as per Rule 47, a copyright society applying for reregistration, had to file an application in Form IX as provided under the Rules within a period of two months from the date of coming into force of the said Rules.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 612 HIGH COURT CAS ES (DELHI) (2022) 1 HCC (Del) of the aforesaid, on 9-5-2013 (which is within one year of the enactment of the Copyright Amendment Act, 2012 and within two months from the enactment of the Copyright Rules 2013), the petitioner filed an application for its reregistration as a copyright society. 7. Even though there was a compulsion and onus upon the respondent to decide reregistration application within two months, the respondent did not take any decision on the petitioner's application for reregistration for over a year, which greatly impacted the petitioner's ability to carry on its business. Therefore, in order to protect its business and the rights of its members, the petitioner began conducting its business as a non-society and was compelled to file a request for the withdrawal of its reregistration application on 20-5-2014, with an intention to file an application for fresh registration at an appropriate stage. However, vide its letter dated 20-11-2014, the respondent categorically rejected the petitioner's request for withdrawal stating the petitioner's application under Section 33(3-A) of the Copyright Act was still under consideration. The petitioner then started working on its functioning and made a representation on 11-1-2018 before the respondent, informing the respondent of the various positive initiatives and developments undertaken by the petitioner towards its members and licensees. 8. However, on 24-5-2021 the petitioner was shocked to receive a non- speaking and unreasoned order dated 25-5-2021 passed by the respondent rejecting the petitioner's application for reregistration as a copyright society with an observation the petitioner's application dated 9-5-2013 stood withdrawn and its application dated 11-1-2018 had been filed belatedly as per the provisions of Section 33(3-A) of the Copyright Act, 1957. The petitioner is filing the present petition, being aggrieved of the order number F. No. P-12-2/2018 IPR-VII dated 25-5-2021 (\"impugned order\") passed by the respondent. 9. It is argued the observations made by the respondent in the impugned order are completely erroneous, incorrect, unreasoned, arbitrary, without application of mind and contrary to the principles of natural justice. It is alleged the respondent has arrived at a conclusion without considering and appreciating the complete facts and law and passed the impugned order, which is liable to be set aside. 10. On the other hand the argument of Respondent 1 UOI is two folds viz. - (a) the case put up by the petitioner in this petition was never put up in the correspondences and he cannot seek the principle of promissory estoppel against the Government as there was never any promise by the Government to accord consent for reregistration of the petitioner's Society as such application, filed in January 2018, was much beyond the two months period as prescribed in the Rules; and (b) reference was made to Dange Committee Report enquiring about the misdeeds of M/s Indian Performing Right Society Limited (IPRS), another society and during the course of enquiry it was found some directors ofIPRS were common in the petitioner's Society and since the IPRS had made changes per recommendations of the Government, it was reregistered. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: High Court Cases (Del)™, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf PHONOGRAPHIC PERFORMANCE LTD. v. UNION OF INDIA (Yogesh Khanna, J.) 613 11. Further the contention of Respondent 2 RMPL is threefold viz.- (a) a the petitioner though sought reregistration vide letter dated 2013, but sought its withdrawal and hence its application automatically stood surrendered. Even otherwise the petitioners were not desirous to continue to function as a society as despite the Central Government declined to accept their letter, the petitioner had actually withdrawn its application for reregistration by its conduct since it started taking licences from the assignees/authors and started acting as authors b for giving licences to various persons, hence to say that their application was pending is totally frivolous; (b) the Central Government was rather satisfied the petitioners were mismanaging hence, it did not grant reregistration and it was well within its power under Section 33(4) of the Copyright Act; and (c) the petitioners rather elected to act as assignees of the authors and hence could not have claimed any lien over reregistration of its candidature as once it had elected c a position, it could not have changed its position to its benefit if the registration was awarded to Respondent 2. Reference was made to Karam Kapahi v. Lal Chand Public Charitable Trust. 1, wherein the court held as under: d e f g h \"53. In the old equity case of Streatfield v. Streatfielcl2 this principle has been discussed in words which are so apt and elegant that, I better quote them: \"Election is the obligation imposed upon a party by courts of equity to choose between two inconsistent or alternative rights or claims in cases where there is a clear intention of the person from whom he derives one that he should not enjoy both. Every case of election, therefore, presupposes a plurality of gifts or rights, with an intention, express or implied, of the party who has a right to control one or both that one should be a substitute for the other. The party who is to take has a choice, but he cannot enjoy the benefit of both. The principle is stated thus in Jarman on Wills 'That he who accepts a benefit under a deed or will must adopt the whole contents of the instrument, conforming to all its provisions, and renouncing every right inconsistent with it' (h). The principle of the doctrine of election is now well settled.\" 12. In National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mastan3, the court held as under: \"23. The \"doctrine of election\" is a branch of \"rule of estoppel\", in terms whereof a person may be precluded by his actions or conduct or silence when it is his duty to speak, from asserting a right which he otherwise would have had. The doctrine of election postulates that when two remedies are available for the same relief the aggrieved party has the option to elect either of them but not both. Although there are certain exceptions to the same rule but the same has no application in the instant case.\" 1 (2010) 4 sec 753 : (2010) 2 sec (Civ) 262 2 (White and Tudor 's Leading Cases in Equity, 9th Edn., Vol. I, 1928) 3 c2006) 2 sec 641 : 2006 sec CL&S) 401 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: High Court Cases (Del)™, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.

Lastly it was argued the petitioners case falls under Rule 47(2) of the Copyright Act, which deals with the reregistration and not Rule 49 and thus, even if opportunity of being heard was not granted then also it did not cause any prejudice to the petitioner. It was argued there is, hence, allow the petition or to remand the matter only on this Court. The reliance is made to Dharampal Satyapal Ltd. v. CCE4: \"45. Keeping in view the aforesaid principles in mind, even when we find that there is an infraction of principles of natural justice, we have to address a further question as to whether any purpose would be served in remitting the case to the authority to make fresh demand of amount recoverable, only after issuing notice to show cause to the appellant. In the facts of the present case, we find that such an exercise would be totally futile having regard to the law laid down by this Court in R. C. Tobacco ( P) Ltd. v. Union of India 5.\" 14. It was argued a hypertechnical view ought not be taken qua the compliance of natural justice since no prejudice is caused to the petitioner by not giving a hearing. Reference was also made to K.L. Tripathi v. SB/6 . 15. It is argued no case is made for reregistration of the petitioner as a copyright society as it never acted as a copyright society after giving its letter of withdrawal in the year 2014; further there was no promise made by the Government and lastly no prejudice is caused to the petitioner by not affording them an opportunity of being heard as it was the petitioner's own choice to become an owner of musical recordings and it never on its own continued as a copyright society after 2013 despite Government giving it's an opportunity, hence cannot seek setting aside of impugned order. 16. It is argued the petitioner even filed an opposition to the application dated 1-3-2018 for registration of Respondent 2 as a copyright society but it did not disclose this fact in WP (C) No. 21 of 2021 and when Respondent 2 was accorded registration only then it had moved the second WP (C) No. 41 of 2021 impleading Respondent 2. 17.

It was vide letter dated 20-5-2014 respondent had rejected its application for withdrawal stating inter alia its application is still under consideration and the petitioner may continue as a copyright society in the interest of owners. The Government claimed such an application for withdrawal was not even maintainable in the eye of the law. Only if the withdrawal b application of the petitioner was accepted by Respondent 1, it could have applied for fresh registration, but since all these years its letter of withdrawal was kept in abeyance by Respondent I itself, hence it could not apply for fresh registration. 24. Admittedly, correspondence was exchanged between the parties viz. letters of petitioner dated 11-1-2018, 9-3-2018 and of 6-12-2018, to disclose c its positive steps to make the petitioner fully compliant to all necessary changes required by Respondent I to be undertaken by it. Rather, per letter dated 31-12-2018 the Government required the petitioner to submit an action taken report on issues indicated in the compliance letter, preferably to Rules 58(8) and 65 of the Copyright Act. The petitioner after making the changes, intimated the Government vide its letter dated 21-1-2019 d and thereafter also wrote letters dated 5-9-2019 and 23-10-2019 giving all compliances to the issues involved. Such correspondences do show the Government kept the application of reregistration filed by the petitioner alive all this time, pursuant to which, the petitioner took steps for its reregistration as a copyright society. 25.

The letter dated 20-11-2014 written to the Chairman of the petitioner by Respondent I notes: \"Subject: Current status of PPL as a registered copyright society matter regarding. Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter dated 20-5-2014 on the above subject and to say that the stand taken by you in the letter in question is not acceptable to the Central Government being not maintainable in the eye of the law. 2. The application dated 9-5-2013 for reregistration as a registered copyright society filed by PPL under Section 33(3-A) of the Copyright Act, 1957 is still under consideration of the Central Government and no final decision has been taken on it so far.

Even an office memorandum of the Copyright Division, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government oflndia, dated 6-10-2016 notes: \"Udyog Bhawan, New Delhi Dated the 6-10-2016 Office Memorandum Subject: Current status of IPRS & PPL respectively as a copyright society clarification regarding. It is stated hereby for general information that Mis Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. (IPRS) and Mis Phonographic Performance Ltd. (PPL) were registered as copyright societies under Section 33 of the pre-amended copyright Act, 1957 for carrying out Copyright business in the field of musical and literary works and sound recording works respectively. However, the said registration was over w.e .f. 21-6-2013 i.e. one year from the date of enactment of the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 2012 on 21-6-2012. Both the societies have applied for reregistration before the Central Government under Section 33 of the amended Act within the prescribed time-limit and their request for reregistration as copyright societies is under examination. 2. Since there were allegations of malpractices against the IPRS, the Central Government has constituted an enquiry against it, which is currently in progress.\" 28. A bare perusal of the office memorandum dated 6-10-2016 would show IPRS and petitioner, both filed applications for withdraw I and there were allegations of malpractices only against IPRS and not against this petitioner and further both applications were admitted to be filed in time and were under examination. All this was enough to give legitimate expectation to the petitioner about pendency of its application and Governments intention to reregister it. 29. The stand of Respondent 1 in its counter-affidavit is IPRS was granted registration after an extensive enquiry and only upon successful completion of all conditions, but, admittedly, there was never any enquiry pending against petitioner and vide letter dated 31-12-2018 (Annexure L ), the Government only required three compliances from petitioner and the petitioner answered those vide its letter dated 21-1-2019 (Annexure M). 30. The arguments of Respondent 2 viz. the petitioners never wished to continue to work as a copyright society, hence sought withdraw! cannot be accepted as firstly what prompted the petitioner to move an application for withdraw} is not an issue at this stage and secondly one only need to examine how the petitioner was made to believe its application was under process and was being examined.

It was working as an owner, because its application for a reregistration was pending, hence, petitioner had never chosen or elected itself to work as an owner of the copyright and not as a society, but it was because of the circumstances explained above. 31. Though it was argued by the respondent, proviso to Rule 49(1) shall be applicable only to applications for registration and not to applications for reregistration but where the petitioner was a registered society prior b to the amendment and where its application for reregistration was in process Respondent 1, being a quasi-judicial authority, ought to have given the petitioner an opportunity of being heard, especially in circumstances enumerated above. 32. It cannot be said, principles of natural justice would apply only to cases of fresh registrations and not to applications for reregistration. Admittedly c there is no separate rule for hearing on applications for reregistration and Rule 49 stipulates the condition only for registration but it is equally true if an application for reregistration is rejected to pave way to register another society, then this principle ought to be read in Rule 47 case and would squarely apply to applications for reregistration. It is needless to mention the certificate granted d to the IPRS on its application for reregistration is too under Rule 49. 33. Thus the impugned order show there was sheer non-application of mind by the competent authority in rejecting the application of the petitioner without giving an opportunity of being heard to it. Respondent 1 rather failed to decide the application on merits and dismissed it on the premise, the petitioner filed fresh application only in June 2018, which premise is wholly incorrect as the application dated June 2018 was never under, Form IX and rather was a letter e given by the petitioner to comply with issues involved. The impugned order is wholly silent qua the correspondences exchanged between petitioner and Respondent 1 and to an office memorandum dated 6-10-2016 which rather declared the application was well within time. 34. Thus before passing the impugned order, Respondent 1 ought to have f considered- (a) rejection of the application of withdraw!; (b) the office memorandum of2016; and (c) correspondences between the year 2014 till 2018 revealing the application of petitioner was being processed at the end of the Government and was alive lest there was no reason for petitioner to correspond with the Government. These facts do not find mention in the impugned order, hence it is bad in law and is set aside. g 35. Now coming to second impugned order dated 18-6-2021, I may first refer to an order dated 2-6-2021 passed in Phonographic Performance Ltd. v. Union of India7 wherein in para 8 it was directed as under: \"8.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 620 HIGH COURT CAS ES (DELHI) (2022) 1 HCC (Del) application, the petitioner has made out a case for a limited ad interim order. However, I am of the view that an order restraining the respondent from processing any other application would not be appropriate at this stage, particularly as no other applicant is even a party before this Court. Suffice it to clarify that, in the event the petitioner succeeds in the present petition, its application for reregistration dated 9-5-2013 under Rule 47 of the Rules would stand revived, and would have to be examined on its own merits. This position will be borne in mind by the respondent, and the respondent shall not take any action inconsistent with this position during the pendency of the present petition. In the event the respondent is considering any other application for registration in the interim, the applicant will also be informed of the pendency of this petition and the contents of this order.\" 36. Respondent 1, while granting the registration to the RMPL Respondent 2, had completely ignored the order passed by this Court in WP No. 21 of 2021, wherein this Court while granting the ad interim stay to the petitioner, clarified Respondent 1 Government would have to keep in mind that in case the petitioner succeeded in the present writ petition, its 2013 reregistration application would stand revived, and directed Respondent 1 to not take any steps inconsistent with the said position during the pendency of the writ petition. 37. Respondent 1 has not considered if the petitioner's reregistration application gets revived, it may not get the registration on the ground as envisaged in Section 33(3) and Rule 49, which says only one copyright society would be registered for administering the rights relating to same class of work i.e. sound recording. 38. If Respondent 2 RMPL registration is not set aside, the same would irreversibly prejudice the petitioner's chances for registration as a copyright society, unless the Government consider giving registration to two societies though, per Rule 49 of the Copyright Rules, the registration of another copyright society for the same class of works is an express ground for rejection of a subsequent application. 39. Respondent 1, after failing to act upon the petitioner's application for reregistration as a copyright society for 9 years and Respondent 2 RMPL's application for registration as a copyright society for 3 years, proceeded in great haste to register Respondent 2 as a copyright society within 15 days of the interim order passed in the first writ petition. There was no reason for Respondent 1 to grant the impugned registration to Respondent 2 in such a hurry. 40. If the first writ petition is allowed, the second writ petition would have to be allowed as a corollary, or in view of the order dated 2-6-2021 passed by this Court in WP (C)-IPD No. 21 of 2021, if the said writ is allowed, the petitioner's application for reregistration would stand revived, and hence the order granting RMPL registration as a copyright society would have to be set aside as RMPL's application for registration was subsequent in time to the petitioner's application. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: High Court Cases (Del)™, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.
