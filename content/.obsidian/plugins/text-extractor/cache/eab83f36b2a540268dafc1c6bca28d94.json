It appears from the plaint that the plaintiff was only five months old at the time when Bhagwan Singh died, viz., in 1899. The mortgage was executed in .May t896; it is therefore clear that the plaintiff was not born at the time when the mortgage was executed; so that even if the Mitakshara law applies without any qualification, the plaintiff is not entitled to contest the validity of the mortgage, for, at the time whe.n it was executed, the plaintiff had no interest in the family property, and Bhagwan Singh acquiesced in the execu. tion thereon and iti th~ circumstances of this case it is clea1· that he was acting not only on beh!l.lf of himself, but also on behalf of all the members of the family who were alive at that time. The result is that the plaintiff's claim fails and that the appellants are entitled to possession under the mortgage, and such consequential relief as can be given under Sect. 144, Civil Proc€dure Code. Their Lordships, therefore, will humbly advise His Majesty that this_ appeal should be allowed, that the judgment and decree of the High Court, dated 22nd July 1923, should be set aside that the plain tiff's suit should be dismissed and that the plaintiff should pay the costs of Lhe appellants in this appeal and t.he costs of the defendant Bishen Singh and his legal representatives in both the Courts in India.

Hallett for the Respondents. JUDGMENT. Lord Shaw.-This is an appeal raising the question of the vali- dity of a Singhalese marriage. A petition was presented by the respondents in the District Court of Tanga.lla in Ceylon for letters of administration of the estate of one, who for shorb, m1.y ba c<1lled Don Ardris de Silva. Don Andris died on the 1st Saptem~>er 1921. The application was made, upon the 14th December of that year, by Singho Appu, the son-in-law of the deceased Don Andris, Don Andris died intestate. The family history of Don Andris was that he had been regularly married in 1885, having as issue the daughter who, through her husband Singho Appu, now claims his whole estate. This first wife died in May 1900. Then in 1901, and for a course of twenty years until 1921, when Don Andris dit:d, the proved family history was as follows : He married one Balahamy) with the procession, the giving of gifts and other ceremonials familiar to the law of Ceylon. There wus, however, one omission, namely, that the·marriage was not registered, and in that sense tha m'lrria.ge was irregular. But registration, however important, was not by law essential.

The father and mother and children all lived together as one family. .At the time of his death she and the eight surviving children were living in the family house. By the law of intest3.te suocession in Ceylon, the estate of the deoeased would have been divided, one half to his widow and the other half equally among the nine children, namely, her eight, and the respondent, the child of the first marriage. The responde.nt-, cilaim that this law of succession operates. The appellants, however -Singho Appu and his wife-deny to the respondents any such right of succession. They maintain that Balahamy was not the wife of Don Andris, and that all her children were illegitimate. They accordingly claim that Dinohamy succeeded to the whole estate. In the circumstances mentioned it is not to be wondered at that, when, on the lt th December 19 !1, letters of administration were grantlld to the appellant, Singho .Appu, as son-in-law of the deceased and husband of Dinohamy, the daughter by the first marriage, he considered it expedient to do something to fortify a claim to the estate. For the result of success in his application would be that the appellants would be able to disinherit and eject from the family home the first respondent and her eight children. A deed, purporting to be a deed of agreement, was accordingly prepared, It was made ready by the 18th Decembar, namely, four days after letters of administration ; and it was executed on the 23rd December. It is sufficient to say of that deed that the estate was declared wholly to belong to the appellant Dinohamy, the daughter of the first-marriage. A certain portion_of the property, however-about one half-was to be given by her as a donation to the eight children; and the deed entirely disinherits their mother, who, as the widow of Don Andris, would have succeeded to the other half. It not on'ly, however, does this, but it further states that Don Andris had \" lived with the said . . . Balahamy as his mistress and not having legally manied her, eight children were born to them.\" She is accordingly, as stated, entirely disinherited by this alleged agreement. · There are only two real questions in the oasa : First; was Balaharny married according to the law of Ceylon to Don Andris ? Secondly, are her or her children's rights affected by the deed of agr .Je- ment? 'l'he sLrength of the appellants' case-there being a total conflict betwt:ien the witnesses on the one si'~nd those on the other-is that the District Judc5e be~ieved the appellants' witnesses, . . . . . . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: The Law Weekly, © 2024 Law Weekly , Chennai.

On the other hand, the two Judges of the Supreme Court of Ceylon, by their judgment dated the 18th December 1925, reversed the District Court's judgment, and on both the points in issue, differed from the learned Judge, disbelieved the witnesses of the appe1Iants, and believed those of the respondents. It is not disputed that according to the Roman Dutch law , there is a presumption in favour of ma.rriage rather than of concubinage; that according to the law of Ceykm, where a man and woman are proved to have lived together as man and wife, the law will presume, unless the contrary be clearly vroved', that they were living together in consequence of a valid marriage and not in a state of concubinage, A judgment substantially in these words [Sastry Velaider Aroneg:iry v. Sembecutty Vaigalie (1)] was pronounced by this Board through Sir Barnes Peacock. Sir Barnes discusses the law with some fullness, quoting among other cases the opinion of Lord Cairns in De Thoren v. Att01ney-General (2), and making-refe. rence to the Scotch leading case, the Breadalbine Case (3).• Since the Brelfda!bane CaseJ4) has been mentioned it may be expedient to note these sentences from the judgment of Lord Oranworth therein : \" .Marriage can only exist as a rosult of mutual agreement. The conduct of the parties, and of their friends and neighbours, in other words, habite and repute, may afford strong, and, in Scotland, attending to the laws of marriage there existing, unanswerable e,; idence, that at some unascertained time a mutual agreement to marry was entered into by the parties passing as man and wife. I cannot, however, think it correct to say that habite and repute in any case make .the marriage. Repute can obviously have no such effect. It is, perhaps, less inaccurate to speak of habite creating marriage if by the word • habite ' we are to understand the daily acts of persons living together, which imply that they consider each other as husband and wife, and it may be taken as implying an agreement to be what they represent themselves as being. It seems to me, however, even here to be an improper use of the word to say that it makes marriage. The distinction is, perhaps, one rather of words than of substance ; but I prefer to say that habite and repute afford by the law of Scotland, as, indeed, of all countries, evidence of marriage, always strong, and in Scotland, unless met by counter evidence, generally conclusive.\" Whether this distinction be merely one of words rather than one of substance does not, in the present case, really arise; because in thEir Lordships' opinion the evidence in this case comes up to the full measure of what would be demanded either in England or in Scotland, or Ceylon, namely, it is unanswerable and conclusive evidence.

The evidence of the Registrar of the Distdct shows that for a long course of years the parties were recognized as married citizens, and even the family functions and ceremonies, such as, in parti- cular, the reception of the relations and other guests in the family house by Don Andris and Balahamy as host and hostess-all such functions were conducted on the footing alone that they were man and wife. 1-{o evidence whatsoever is afforded of repudiation of this relation by husband or wife or anybody, The lell'rned Judges of the Supreme Court have discussed the evidence carefully, and have come to these conclusions. The Board thinks they are riglit. The second point has reference to the alleged deed of agree• ment. It has already been noted as remarkable that Singho Appu thought it right within a few days of letters of administration being granted to him to fortify his and his wife's position by getting an agreement of the kind. The facts with regard to it are that the widow gave no instructions for its prep?.ration ; that she was not consulted as to its provisions; that she obeyed a· message to go to Siugho Appu's house, and that ~he the-re, at his request, signed the deed. She had no legal adviser. The deed was in English, but she oould not read English. She sa.ys tha.t she under,;;t:JOd that she was required to i,ut her name to it because it concerned her half of the estate, but that she did not know anything else. It is almost beyond reason to expect that she would have knowingly signed a deed declaring that she herself had lived with Don Andris for twenty years as his mistress, and that all her children were illegitimate children. The most careful examination of the conduct of the notary in such a case must be made. Its outstanding fea.ture is that being instructed by one party to a transaction involving not only the extinction and alteration of patrimonial rights, but also a degrading alteration of the status and moral life of others who were to ba made parties to the deed, he never seems to have suggested that it was a case for another notary being employed to protect the wife and children's interests. 'fhe transaction and the evidence by which it was supported are aHke discreditable. J t would require the very strongest evid enoe in such circumstances to prevent the respondents from being protected against such a transaction by a Uourt of law. Their Lordships agree with the Supreme Court that it is not proved that the wife understood, or had sufficiently explained to her, this deed written in a for€ign tongue,• and think it is no bar to her and her children's ri~hts under thE? Ceylon law of intestate succession. · ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: The Law Weekly, © 2024 Law Weekly , Chennai.
