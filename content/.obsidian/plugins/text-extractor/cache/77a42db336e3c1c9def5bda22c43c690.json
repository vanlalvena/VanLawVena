Power Purchase Agreement - Clause of force majeure - Application of Disposing of the appeals, the Court HELD: 1. The regulatory powers of the Central Commission, so far as tariff is concerned, are specifically mentioned in Section 79(1) of the Electricity Act, 2003. This regulatory power is a g~neral one, and it is very difficult to state that when the Commission adopts tariff under Section 63, it functions de hors its general regulatory power under Section 79(1)(b). For one thing, ·such regulation takes place under the Central Government's guidelines. l<or another, in a situation where there are no guidelines or in a situation which is not covered by the guidelines, the Commission's power to \"regulate\" tariff is completely done away with, is not a correct way of reading the said statutory provisions. The first rule of statutory interpretation is that the. statute must be read as a whole. As a concomitant of that rule, it is also clear that all the discordant notes struck by the various Sections must be harmonized. Considering the fact that the non-obstante clause advisedly restricts itself to Section 62, there is no good reason to put Section 79 out of the way altogether. The reason why Section 62 alone has been put out of the way is that determinatio~ of tariff can take place in one of two ways-either under Section 62, where the Commission itself determines the tariff in accordance with the provisions of the Act, (after laying down the terms and conditions for determination of tariff mentioned in Section 61) or under Section 63 where the Commission adopts tariff that is alrea~y .determined by a transparent process of bidding. In either case, ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY 155 REGULATORY COMMISSION the general regulatory power of the Commission under Section .. 79(1)(b) is the source of the power to regulate, which includes . the power to determine or adopt tariff. In fact, Sections 62 and 63 · del!I with \"determination\" of tariff, which is part of \"regulating\" tariff. Whereas \"determining\" tariff for inter-State transmission of electricity is dealt with by Section 79(l)(d), Section 79(1)(b) is a wider source of power to \"regulate\" tariff. It is clear that in a situation where the guidelines issued by the Central Government under Section 63 cover the situation, the Central Commission is bound by those guidelines and must exercise its regulatory functions, albeit under Section 79(1)(b), only in accordance with those guidelines. It is only in a situation where there are no guidelines framed at all or where the guidelines do not deal with a given situation that the Commission's general regulatory powers under Section 79(l)(b) caii then be used. [Para 19Jll80- E-ll; 181-A-D] 2.1 The scheme that emerges from Sections 25 and 30 is that whenever there is inter-Stale generation or supply of electricity, it is the Central Government that is involved, and whenever there is intra-State generation or supply of electricity, the State Government or the State Commission is involved. This is the precise scheme of the entire Act, including Sections 79 and 86. It would be seen that Section 79(1) itself in sub-sections (c), (d) and (e) speaks of inter-State transmission and inter-State operations. This is to be contrasted with Section 86 which deals with functions of the State Commission which uses the expression \"within the State\" in sub-clauses (a), (b), and (d), and \"intra-state\" in sub-clause (c). This being the case, it is clear that the PPA, which deals with generation and supply of electricity, would either have to be governed by the State Commission or the Central Commission. The State Commission's jurisdiction is only where generation and supply takes place within the State. On the other hand, the moment generation and sale takes pla.:e in more than one State, the Central Commission becomes the appropriate Commission under the Act. If the submission of the appellant is accepted and it is held in the AD's case that there is no composite scheme for generation and sale, it would be clear that neither Commission would .have jurisdiction, something which would lead A B c D E F G H 156 A 8 c D E F G H SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. to absurdity. Since generation and sale of electricity is in more than one State obviously Section 86 docs not get attracted. This being the case, it is observed that the expression \"composite scheme\" does not mean anything more than a scheme for ~:eneration and sale of electricity in more than one State. The dictionary definitions lead to the conclusion. that the expression \"composite\" only means \"consisting of at least two elements\". In the context of the instant case, generation and sale being in more than one State, this could be referred to as \"composite\". Even otherwise, the expression used in Section 79(l)(b) is that generating companies must enter into or otherwise. have a \"composite scheme\". This makes it clear that the expression \"composite scheme\" docs not have some special meaning-it is enough that generating companies have, in any manner, a scheme for gcnerntion and sale of electricity which must be in more than one State. [Paras 22-25)(182-F-G; 183-A-C) Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms by Mc- Graw-Hill 6th Edu; Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyar 3rd Edn - referred to. 2.2 The tariff policy dated 6'h June, 2006 is the statutory policy which is enunciated under Section 3 of the Electricity Act. The amendment of 28'h January, 2016 throws considerable light on the expression \"composite scheme\". The definition of composite scheme in the Tariff Policy is an important aid to the construction of Section 79(1)(b) which cannot be doubted and, correctly brings out the meaning of this expression as meaning nothing more tlian a scheme by a generating company for generation and sale of electricity in more than one State. Section . 64(5) begins with a non-obstante clause which would indicate that in all cases involving inter-State sup11ly, transmission, or wheeling of electricity, the Central Commission alone has jurisdiction. Section 64(5) can only apply if, the jurisdiction otherwise being with the Central Commission alone, by application of the parties concerned, jurisdiction is to be given lo the State Con1mission having jurisdiction in respect of the licensee who intends to distribute and make payment for electricity. Therefore, the Central Commission had the necessary jurisdiction to embark upon the issues raised in the instant cases. [Paras 26,27)(184-A- ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY 157 REGULATORY COMMISSION B, E-F, G-11; 185-AJ A 3.1 In so far as a force majeure event occurs de hors the contract, it is dealt with by a rule of positive law under Section 56 of the Contract Act, 1872. The doctrine of frustration cannot apply to these cases as the fundamental basis of the PPAs remains unaltered. Nowhere do the PPAs stale that coal is to be procured only from Indonesia at a particular price. In fact, it is clear on a reading of the PPA as a whole that the price payable for the supply of coal is entirely for the person who sets up the power plant to bear. The fact that the fuel supply agreement has lo be appended to the PPA is only to indicate that the raw material for the working of the plant is there and is in order. It is clear that an unexpected rise in the price of coal will not absolve the generating companies from performing their part of the contract for the very good reason B c that when they submitted their bids, this was a risk they knowingly took. The mere fact 'that the bid may be 11011-escalable does not mean that the respondents are precluded from raising the plea of· D frustrntion, if otherwise it is available in law and can be pleaded by them. But the fact that a 11on-cscalable tariff has been paid for, for example, in the AD's case, is a factor which may be taken into account only to show that the risk of supplying electricity at the tariff indicated was upon the generating company. [Paras 32, E 4U][ J~7-Il; 191-D-F] 'Chitty on Contracts' 31st Edn., para 14-151; 'Trei1el on Frustralion and Force lvfajeure' 3rd edn., para 12-034, 15-158 - referred to. 3.2 Given the fact that the PPA must be read as a whole, F and .that clauses 12.3 and 12.7(a) are ·a part of the same scheme of force majeure under the contrnct, it is clear that the expression \"hindered\" in clause 12.7(a) really goes with the expression \"partly prevents\" in clause 12.3 •. Force majeure clauses are to be narrowly construed, and obviously the expression \"prevents\" in clause 12.3 is spoken of also in clause 12. 7(a). When \"prevent\" G is preceded by the expression \"wholly or partly\", it is reasonable to assume that the expression \"prevented\" in clause 12.7(a) goes with the expression \"wholly\" in clause 12.3 and the expression \"hindered\" in clause 12. 7(a) goes with the expression \"partly\". This .being so, it is clear that there must be something which H 158 A B .c D E F SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. partly prevents the performance of the obligation under the agreement. Clause 12.04 of PPA makes it clear that changes in the cost of fuel, or the agreement becoming onerous to perform, arc not treated as force majcure events under the PPA itself. Thus, neither was the fundamental basis of the contract dislodged nor was any frustrating cvcut, except for a rise in the price of coal, excluded by clause 12.4. Alternative modes of performance were available, albeit at a higher price. This does not lead to the contract, as a whole, being frustrated. Consequently, neither clause 12.3 nor 12.7, referable to Section 32 of the Contract Act, would apply so as to enable the grant of com1>ensatory tariff to , the respondents. Having once held that clause 12.4 applies as a result of which rise in the price of fuel cannot be regarded as a force majeure event contractually, it is difficult to appreciate a submission that in the alternative Section 56 would apply.

Co. Ltd. 1919 (2) KB 778 - referred to. 4.1 Both the guidelines and the model PPA, of which clause 13 is a part, have been drafted by the Central Government itself.'· It is, therefore, clear that the PPA only fleshes out what is mentioned in clause 4.7 of the guidelines, and goes on to explain what the expression \"any change in law\" means. This being the G case, it is dear that the definition of \"law\" speaks of all laws including electricity laws in force in India. Electricity laws, as has been seen from the definition, means the Electricity Act, .Rules and Regulations made thereunder from time to time, and any other law pertaining to electricity. This being so, it is clear that H the expression \"in force in India\" in the definition of 'law' goes · ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY 159 REGULATORY COMMISSION with \"all laws\". This is for the reason that otherwise the said A expression would become tautologous, as electricity laws that are in force in ~ndia arc already referred to in the definition of \"electricity laws\" as contained in the PPA. Once this is clear, at least textually it is clear that \"all laws\" would have to be read with \"in force in India\" and would, therefore, refer only to Indian laws. Even otherwise, from a reading of clause 13, it is clear that clause 13.1.l is in four different parts. The first part speaks of enacted laws; the second speaks of interpretation of such laws by Courts or other instrumentalities; the third speaks of changes in consents, approvals or licences which result in change in cost of the business of selling electricity; and the fourth refers to any change in the declared law of the land for the project, cost of implementation of re-settlement anti rehabilitation or cost of implementing the environmental management plan. 'Competent Court' in clause 13.1.2 is defined as meaning only the judicial system of India. [Para 481[206-G-ll; 207-A~U] 4.2 The expression \"any law\" occurs in both sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of clause 13.1.1, which expression must be given the same meaning in both sub-sections. This being the case, as in sub-clause (2), this expression would refer only to . Indian law, the same meaning will have to. be given to the very same expression in sub-clause (1). Even otherwise, sub-clauses (1) and (2) form part of the same contractual scheme in that sub- clause (1) refers to the euactni'ent of laws, whereas sub-clause (2) relates to interpretation of those very laws by a competent Court of law!fribunal or Indian Government instrumentality. 'Competent Court', speaks only of the Indian judicial system and, therefore, the enactments spoken of in sub-clause (1) would necessarily refer only to Indian enactments. It is clear that if otherwise the expression \"any law\" in clause 13 when read with the definition of\"law\" and \"Electricity Laws\" leads unequivocally to the conclusion that it refers only to the law of India, it would be unsafe to rely upon the other clauses of the agreement where Indian law is specifically mentioned to negate this conclusion.

There arc many P.PAs entered into with different generntors. Some generators ma~· source Cud only from India.

The meaning of the expression '\"change in law\" in clause 13 cannot depend upon whether coal is sourced in a particular PPA from outside India or within India. The meaning C would have to remain the same whether coal is sourced wholly in India, partly in India and partly from outside, or wholly from outside. The proposition that if performance of a contract is to be done in a foreign country, what would be relevant would be foreign law, this would be true.as a general statement of law, but for the ,. 0 reason given, would not apply to the Pl'As in the instant case. [Para 52)(208-D-G] E F G H 4.4 It would be seen th:1t under cl:tuse 13.1.1 if there is a change in any consent, approval or liecnce available or obtained for the project, otherwise than fur the default of the seller, which results in any change in any cost of the business of selling electricity, then the said seller will be governed under clause 13.1.1. It is clear from a reading of the Resolution dated 21\". June, 2013, which resulted in the letter of 31\" July, 2013, issued by the Ministry of Power, that the earlier coal distribution policy contained in the letter dated l81 h March, 2007 stands modified as the Government has now approved a revised arrangement for supply of coal. It has been decided that, seeing the overall domestic availability and the likely requirement of power projects, the power projects would only be entitled to a certain percentage of what was earlier allowable. [Para 53)(208-H; 209-A-C) 4.5 Both tlie letter dated 31.07.2013 and the revised tariff policy are statutory documents being issued u/s. 3 and have the force oflaw. This being so, it is clear that so far as the procurement of Indian coal is concerned, to the extent that the supply from Coal India and other Indian sources is cut down, the PPA read with these documents provides in clause 13.2 that while ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION determining the consequences of change in law, parties shall have due regard to the principle that the purpose of compensating the party affected by such change in law is to restore, through monthly tal'iff payments, the affected party to the economic position as if such change in Jaw has not occurred. J<-urther, for the operation period of the PPA, compensation for any increase/decrease in cost to the seller shall be determined and be effective from such date as decided by the CERC. Though change in Indonesian law would not qualify as a change in law under the guidelines read with the PPA, change in Indian law certainly would. The tribunal's judgment -~nd the Commission's orders following the said judgment are set aside. CERC would go into the matter afresh and determine what relief should be granted to those power generators who fall within Cl. 13 of the PPA. [Paras 53, 541[212- B-D, G-H) CCE v.

The present appeals arise from a judgment of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity dated 7'h April, 2016. The facts necessary to appreciate the issues which arise in the present case, which will cover all the cases before us, will be taken only from Civil Appeal No.5348of2016, namely Prayas (Energy) Group vs. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. 2. Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 provides for procurement of power and determination of tariff by a transparent competitive bidding process. Once this is done, the appropriate Commission is to \"adopt\" the tariff which is accepted in the competitive bid subject to guidelines that are made by the Central Government. On 19 111 January, 2005, the Central Government issued detailed guidelines under this provision, which were amended from time to time. On I\" February, 2006, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) issued a public notice inviting proposals for supply of power on long term basis under three different competitive bid processes. The pa11icipating bidders were to decide on the tariff and quote such tariff after competing against each other. The bidders were entitled to quote cscalable or non-escalable tariff or partly escalable and ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] partly non-escalable tariff, as was considered appropriate by them to cover their respective risks so as to obtain whatever returns are available to them. The best levelised tariff as per certain pre-disclosed criteria was to be followed in order to arrive at the lowest tender. 3. Haryana Utilities also initiated a separate competitive bidding process for purchase of2000 MW on a long term basis. This was done on 25'h May. 2006. The participating bidders were also entitled to quote bids on the lines ofci1eGUVNL public notice. Both the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commissioh and the Haryana State Regulatory C0111mission approved the bid documents and the process proposed by GUVNL and the Haryana Utilities, after which Requests for Proposal were issued by both of them. On 2\"\"/4'11 January, 2007, Adani Enterprises Consortium submitted its bid for generation and supply of I 000 MW to GUYNL, quoting a levelised tariff of Rs.2.3495/kWh (Rs. I /kWh as the capacity charge and Rs.1.3495/kWh as 11011-escalable energy charge). In the bid, the Consortium indicated that the lead member, Adani Enterprises, had an arrangement for indigenous coal requirement of the project with Gtuarat Mineral Development Corporation, as the said Corporation had been allotted a certain coal block in the State of Chhattisgarh. Also, a Memorandum of Understanding was entered into between Adani Enterprises Ltd. and a Gennan Company for supply of non-coking coal of3 to 5 million tons (imported coal) on a long term basis till the year 2032. A similar Memorandum of Understanding was also entered into between Adani Enterprises and a Japanese agent for supply of 3 to 5 million tons of coal again on a long term basis. The two Memoranda of Understanding were attached to the bid submitted by Adani Enterprises. 4. On J J •h January, 2007, the AJani Enterprises Consortium was selected by GUYNL as the successful bidder for supply of I 000 MW of power and a Letter of Intent was issued in its favour. On 2\"ct February, 2007, a Power Purchase Agreement was entered into between GUVNL and Adani Power and this was for supply of power from a power project being set up at Korba in Chhattisgarh. This was changed to a Mundra Project in Gujarat. On 1 S•h April, 2007, a supplementary PPA was signed to this effect. 5. As far as Haryana is concerned, Adani Power submitted their bid for supply of 1425 MW of power to Haryana Utilities on 24'11 November, 2007. This was at a levelised tariff of Rs.2.94/kWh from the Mundra Power Project. The energy charges quoted were 163 A 8 c D E F G H 164 A B c D E F G H SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. 11011-escalable. Adani Power was declared as the successful bidder in Haryana for supply of 1424 MW contracted capacit)r on I 71h July. 2008 and a Letter of Intent was issued. Two separate PPAs were executed by Adani Power with two Haryana entities for supply of 712 MW of power to each of them from the Mundra Power Project. The Haryana State Commission adopted the tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act on 31 SI July, 2008 (The Gujarat State Commission had adopted the tariffun'der Section 63 for supply of power to GUVNL on 20•h December, 2007). An important part of the case on behalf ofthe respondents is that a change in law in Indonesia took place in 20 I 0 and 2011, which aligned the cxpott price of coal from Indonesia to international market prices instead of the price that was prevalent for the last 40 years.This being the case, in both the cases, Adani Power filed a petition before the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission being Petition No.155of2012 on 5•1i July, 2012 under Section 79 of the Electricity Act seeking reliefon the score of the impact of the Indonesian Regulation to either discharge them from the performance of the PPA on account of frustration, or to evolve a mechanism to restore the petitioners to the same economic condition prior to occurrence of the change in law. 6. On 16'\" October, 2012, the Central Commission held that the Power Purchase Agreements entered into by Adani in both the cases constituted a composite scheme for generation and sale of electricity as envisaged under Section 79( I )(b) of the Electricity Act. This being so, it . held that it was the appropriate Commission under the Act and not the respective State Commissions, which had jurisdiction in the matter. A review petition against this order was dismissed on l 6 1 h January, 2013. 7. On 2\"d April, 2013, the Central Commission passed an order, whereby the claim of Adani Power on the grounds of force majeure and/or change in law was held not to be admissible. However, the Commission held that in exercise of the regulatory powers provided under Section 79 of the Act, the Central Commission can provide redressal of grievances to generating companies, considering the larger public interest, and hence constituted a committee to look into the alleged difficulties faced by Adani and to find an acceptable solution thereto. 8. On I 6 1 h August, 2013, pursuant to the order dated 2\"d April, 2013, the Committee constituted by the C0111i11ission submitted a rep01t. Based on the Committee's repo11, on 21 SI February, 2014, the Central Commission proceeded to grant compensatory tariff. Appeals and ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] cross-appeals were filed against this order, including cross objections. On I\" August 2014, cross-objection filed by Adani Power was rejected by the Appellate Tribunal as not maintainable. On 31\" October, 2014, the Appellate Tribunal rejected the prayer for condonation of delay and consequently Appeal No. 10016 of 2014 was filed by Adani Power. Against this order, Adani Power filed an appeal before the Supreme Court, and this Court, in its order dated 31\" March, 2015 held: \"the Appellant (Adani Power) is entitled to argue any proposition of law, be it \"force majeure\" or \"change in law\" in support of the order dated 21.2.2014 quantifying the compensatory tariff, the correctness of which is under challenge before the_ Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No.98 'of 2014 and Appeal No.116 of 2014 preferred by the respondents, so long as such argument is based · on the facts which are already pleaded before the Central Commission.\" 9. Finally, the Appellate Tribunal on 7 1 h April, 2016, passed the impugned judgment in all the aforesaid cases before us. The Tribunal held, agreeing with the Commission, that generation and sale of power by Adani Power to GUVNL and Haryana Utilities was a composite scheme within the meaning of Section 79(1) (b) of the Act and that, therefore, the Central Commission would have jurisdictioh'to proceed fu11her in the matter. The Appellate Tribunal considered the Supreri1e Cburt order dated 31\" March, 2015 and felt that the argument of force majeure and change in law could be gone into by it. It ultimately concluded, having regard to the law on frustration contained in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the relevant provisions of the PP As, that force majeure was made out on the facts of these cases and reversed the Commission on this score. It also reversed the Commission on exercise of regulatory powers under Section 79, stating that these powers could not be exercised once there was a PPA entered into under Section 63 of the Act. It also held that change in law provisions do not apply to foreign law and, therefore, changes in Indonesian law did not come within the scope of the provisions. Insofar as changes in Indian law were concerned, it held that the Government Policies that were relied upon, do not constitute 'law'. Accordingly, the matler was remanded to the Commission to find out the impact of the force majcure event to grant compensatory tariff. The Commission by its order dated 6.12.2016 has arrived at a certain determination as to compensatory tariff to be granted 165 A B c D E F G H \"I . 166 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. A on account of force majeure. 13 c D E F G H I 0. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. On behalf of the appellants Senior Counsel Shri Ramachandran, and Shri Prashant Bhushan have argued that the lipe1ty given to Adani Power by tlie order dated 31st March, 2015 of this Court was only limited to support the quantification of compensatory tariff granted by the Central Commission by its order dated 21st February, 2014. Hence, Adani Power is not entitled to raise the issue of force majeure and change in law as a substantive issue, the force majeure claim and the change in law claim having been rejected by the Central Commission in its earlier order; and there being no val id appeal against the said order, force majeure and change in law cannot be gone into. It is further argued, in the alternative, that in any case, force majeure either under Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 or under clauses 12.3 and 7 of the respective PPAs make it clear tliat it must be an unforeseen event or circumstance that wholly or partly prevents the affected party in the performance of its obligations under the agreement. Acco1:ding to learned counsel, Adani voluntarily decided to quote energy charges as non-escalable in order to be competitive and, therefore, get the award of the contract. It cannot now, in the guise of being affected by force majeure, convert this into an escalable tariff. They have fu1ther argued that the bid given by Adani Enterprises was ' not pren~ised on the import of coal from Indonesia only and this being the case it was open to them to get coal from any source. The price of coal is the price of raw material and if prices go up, a contract does not get frustrated merely because it becomes commercially onerous, as the PPA itself states in clause 12.4. In any event, the fundamental basis of the PPAs between the parties was not premised on the price of coal imported from Indonesia. l l. On a true construction of the Act, learned counsel argued in suppo1t of the Tribunal judgment that Section 63 of the Electricity Act is a standalone provision and is notwithstanding anything contained in Section 62. It is obvious that under Section 62 read with Section 61 and 64, the Commission has to \"determine\" tariff under the Act having regard to various factors, whereas under Section 63 of the Act, the Commission does not \"determine\" but only \"adopts\" tariff obtained through a transparent process of competitive bidding. This being the case, it is clear that there is no residuary source of power contained in the Commission either in Section 79 or otherwise to fix compensatory tariffs ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] once the tariff is adopted under Section 63. If at all, such tariff can be modified only in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government and not otherwise. They also argued that the Central Commission itself has no jurisdiction in view of the fact that on facts there is no composite scheme for the reason that the generation and sale of electricity from the power project ofAdani, under independent PPAs to Gujarat and Haryana Utilities, with different tariffs, and from different generating units selected under different competitive bidding processes, would show that there is no one composite scheme containing uniform tariffs. This being the case, the State Commissions alone would have . jurisdiction. It was further argued that there is no change in law, either for the very good reason stated by the Commission, viz. that change in law applies to Indian and not Indonesian law, and further, a change in the tariff policy in India will also not constitute change in law. They, therefore, supported the Tribunaljudgmenton this aspect. 12. Learned Senior counsel Shri Kapil Sibal, Shri Harish Salve, Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and Shri C.S. Vaidyanathan, on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, countered each one of these submissions. According to learned counsel, first and foremost the Central Commission alone would have jurisdiction on the facts of these cases, inasmuch as Sections 79 and 86 form part of one scheme. It was argued by them that all cases fall within either Section 79 or Section 86. It is clear that under Section 86, the State Commissions have only to deal with generation and sale of electricity within the State. When . generation and sale takes place outside the State, as is the case here, the State Commission would have no jurisdiction under Section 86, and consequently Section 79( I )(b) has to be read as part of a scheme in which the moment generation and sale of electricity is inter-State and not intra State, the Central Commission alone would have jurisdiction. Judged in this light, the expression \"composite scheme\" would only mean that generation and sale of electricity would be in more than one State. For this they also relied on the definition of\"composite scheme\" in the 2016 Central Government Pol icy. 13. They further argued that the scheme of the Act shows that neither 61 nor Section 79 are done away with when Section 63 applies. Section 63 does not use the expression \"notwithstanding anything contained in this Act\". It is clear, therefore, that all these Sections have to be harmoniously construed. Section 79 is without a doubt a repository 167 A B c D E F G H 168 A B c D E F G H SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. of power to fix tariffs and/or modify fixation even when Section 63 applies. Indeed, Shri Sibal argued that ifthere were no guidelines or ifa matter arose de hors the guidelines, then obviously there cannot be a gap in the law which remains unfilled. The residuary power of the Commission necessarily comes in under Section 79. In any event, they also argued that the guide I ines, as amended, that are issued by the Central Government under Section 63 clearly take care of the present situation : in that any change in law that occurs and any dispute which relates to tariffs can both be resolved before the Central Commission. 14. They also countered the submissions on force majcure by stating that the fundamental basis of the contract was the foe) supply agreement that was to be entered into, and pointed out various clauses in the PPAs to show that the fuel supply agreement and imported coal were both very important elements, both in the bid and the PPAs. Non- escalable tariffs do not lead to the conclusion that if a source of coal becomes unavailable in a manner ttiat completely undermines the basis of the bid, the tariff cannot be adjusted. lfotherwise they fall within the change in law provision and/or force majeure provision, the mere fact that a non-escalable tariff has been quoted would make no difference. A large part of the argument was centered around the meaning of the expression \"frustration\" in the Contract Act and the correct construction of clause 12 of the PPA. A large number of authorities, both English and Indian, were cited to show that the contract had become commercially impracticable, and that they would have to fold up operations, which would not be in public interest as the consumers would then have to obtain electricity at rates much higher than were quoted by them. According to them, a force n.1ajellre event in Clause 12 takes place the moment performance is \"hindered\" and there can be no doubt that an astronomical rise in prices of Indonesian coal, thanks to a change in law, has ceiiainly hindered performance. They also argued that in any event the change in law clause is very wide and since the PPA deals with imported coal, obviously change in law would cover foreign law. They also went on to add that whe1i the PPA wanted to restrict a particular clause to Indian law, it did so expressly. They also stated that it is significant that neither GUVNL nor Haryana Utilities had filed appeals in the preseht case, and the Government had in several policy decisions and statements made it clear that in cases like the present, where there is grave unforeseen hardship on account of non-allocation oflndian coal, the ri~e ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRIC!lY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.) in cost should be adequately compensated. They, therefore, questioned the locus standi of the co1Jsumer groups. who are the only appellants before us, stating that on the estimation made by the respondents, the impact of increase in both cases on tariff would be extremely minimal as opposed to the huge accumulated losses suffered by these entities which would make them fold up. Ultimately, it was argued that even the Central Commission did not give them the entire benefit of rise in price in coal, and consequently in the final analysis the relief granted on the ground of force majcure by the Central Commission should not be disturbed, and relief on the ground of change in law should; in addition, have been given to them. 15. The learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of the Union of India, sub111itted before us that he was not interested in the ultimate outcome of the appeals before us. He was only appearing in order to apprise us that the electricity sector, having been privatized, has largely fulfilled the object sought to be achieved by the 2003 Act, which is that electricity generation, being delicenced, should result in production of far greater el~ctricity than was earlier produced. He urged us not to disturb the delicate balance sought to achieved by the Act i.e. that producers or generators of electricity, in order that they set up power plants, be entitled to a reasonable margin of profit and a reasonable return on their capital, so that they are induced to set up more and more power plants. This must be consistent with competitiveness among them, which then translates itself into reasonable tariffs that arc payable by consu111ers ofelectricity. For this purpose, he relied strongly upon Section 3 of the Electricity Act, which states that the Central Government, shall fro111 time to time, prepare a National Electricity Policy and a tariff policy in consultation with the State Governments, and the authority for development of the power system, based on optimal utilization of natural resources. According to him, the National Electricity Policy and tariff policy that are issued from ti111e to ti111e, being statuto1y in nature, are binding on all concerned. This is, in fact, further r.ecognized by Section 6l(i) by which the appropriate Com111ission, in specifying terms and conditions for determination of tariffs, shall be guided by the National Electricity Policy and tariff policy. The Central Government's role can further be seen even in Section 63, where guidelines that arc binding on all are issued by the Central Govcrn111ent in cases where there is a transparent process of bidding. Further, according to him, Section 79(4) 169 A B c D E F G H 170 A B c D E F G H SUPREME COURT REPORTS (2017] 3 S.C.R. also points in the same direction, stating that, in discharge of its functions, the Central Commission sha II be guided by the National Electricity Policy, National Electricity Plan, and tariff policy published under Section 3. He also referred us to the Cabinet Committee for Economic Affairs recognizing the overall shortfall in manufacture of domestic coal and the new coal distribution policy issued in July, 2013 pursuant to the Cabinet Committee which, according to him, are in the nature of binding directions making it clear· that as generators of electricity, who depend upon indigenous coal, have been given less coal than was anticipated, should be allowed either to import the coal themselves, or purchase imported coal from Coal India Ltd., with the difference in price being passed through to them. He further referred to and relied upon the revised tariff policy of 28'h January, 2016 for the same purpose. Relevant provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 16. The 2003 Act did away with three earlier statutes in which a completely different regime for generating and supply of electricity was provided for, namely, the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity (Supply)Act, 1928 and the Electricity Regulato1y Commissions Act, 1998. The Statement of Objects of Reasons for th is Act reads as follows: \"The Electricity Supply Indust1y in India is presently governed by three enactments namely, the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998. I. I The Indian Electricity Act, 1910 created the basic framework for electric supply industry in India which was then in its infancy. The Act envisaged growth of the electricity indust1y through private licensees. Accordingly, it provided for licensees who could supply electricity in a specified area. It created the legal framework for laying down of wires and other works relating to the supply of electricity. 1.2 The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 mandated the creation of a State Electricity Board. The State Electricity Board has the responsibility of arranging the supply of electricity in the State. It was felt that electrification which was limited to cities needed to be extended rapidly and the State should step in to shoulder this responsibility through the State Electricity Boards. Accordingly the State Electricity Boards through the successive ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] Five Year Plans undertook rapid growth expansion by utilizing Plan funds. 1.3 Over a period of time, however, the performance of SEBs has deteriorated substantially on account of various factors. For instance, though power to fix tariffs vests with the State Electricity Boards, they have generally been unable to take decisions on tariffs in a professional and independent manner and tariff determination in practice has been done by the State Governments. Cross-subsidies have reached unsustainable levels. To address this issue and to provide for distancing of government from determination of tariffs, the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, was enacted in 1998. It created the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and has an enabling provision through which the State Governments can create a State Electricity Regulatory Commission. I 6 States have so far notified/created State Electric_ity Regulatory Commissions either under the Central Act or under their own Reform Acts. 2. Starting with Orissa, some State Governments have been undertaking reforms through their own Reform Acts. These reforms have involved unbundling of the State Electricity Boards into separate Generation, Transmission and Distribution Companies through transfer schemes for the transfer of the assets and staff into successor Companies. Orissa, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have passed their Reform Acts and unbundled their State Electricity Boards into separate companies. Delhi and Madhya Pradesh have also enacted their Reforms Acts which, inter alia, envisage un bu nd I ing/ corporatisation of SEBs. 3. With the policy of encouraging private sector participation in generation, transmission a1·1d distribution and the objective of distancing the regulatory responsibilities from the Government to the Regulatory Commissions. the need for harmonizing and rationalizing the provisions in the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998 in a new self-contained comprehensive legislation arose. Accordingly, it became necessary to enact a new legislation for regulating the electricity supply industry in the 171 A B c D E F G H 172 A B c D E F ~ .. SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. country which would replace the existing laws, preserve its core features other than those relating to the mandatory existence of the State Electricity Board and the responsibilities of the State Government and the State Electricity Board with respect to regulating licensees. There is also need to provide for newer concepts like power trading and open access. There is also need to obviate the requirement of each State Government to pass its own Reforms Act. The Bi II has progressive features and endeavours to strike the right balance given the current realities of the power sector in India. It gives the State enough flexibility to develop their power sector in the manner they consider appropriate. The Electricity Bill, 200 l has been finalized after extensive discussions and consultations with the States and all other stake holders and experts. 4. The main features of the Bill are as follows:- (i) Generation is being delicensed and captive generation is being freely permitted. Hydro projects would, however, need approval of the State Government and clearance from the Central· Electricity Authority which wou Id go into the issues of dam safety and optimal utilization of water resources. (ii) There would be a Transmission Utility at the Central as well as State level, which would be a Government company and have the responsibility of ensuring that the transmission network is developed in a planned and coordinated manner to meet the requirements of the sector. The loaddispatch function could be kept with the Transmission Utility or separated. In the case of separation the load dispatch function would have to remain with a State Government organization/company. (iii) There is provision for private transmission licensees. (iv) There would be open access in transmission fro1i1 the outset with provision for surcharge fortaking care of current level of G cross subsidy with the surcharge being gradually phased out. H (v) Distribution licensees would be free to unde1iake generation and generating companies would be free to take up distribution licensees. (vi) The State Electricity Regulatory Commissions may permit 174 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. A 17. In the present case, we are concerned with the following Sectioni;: \"Section 3. National Electricity Policy and Plan. - (1) The Central Government shall, from time to time, prepare the National Electricity Policy and tariff policy, in consultation with the State B Governments and the Authority for development of the power system based on optimal utilisation of resources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear substances or materials, hydro and renewable sources of energy. (2) The Central Government shall publish the National Electricity c Policy and tariff policy from time to time.

(2) The Appropriate Commission may require a licensee or a C generating company to furnish separate details, as may be specified in respect of generation. transmission and distribution for determination of tariff. (3) The Appropriate Commission shall not, while determining the tariff under this Act, show undue preference to any consumer of D electricity but may differentiate according to the consumer's load factor, power factor, voltage, total consumption of electricity during any specified period or the time at which the supply is required or the geographical position ofa11y area, the nature of supply and the purpose for which the supply is required. E (4) No tariff or part of any tariff may ordinarily be amended, more frequently than once in any financial year, except in respect of any changes expressly permitted under the terms of any fuel surcharge formula as may be specified.

The construction of Section 63, when read with the other. provisions of this Act, is what comes up for decision in the present appeals. It may be noticed that Section 63 begins with a non-obstante clause, but it is a non-obstante clause covering only Section 62. Secondly, unlike Section 62 read with Sections 61 and 64, the appropriate Commission G H 180 A B c D E F G H SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. does not \"determine\" tariff but only \"adopts\" tariff already determined under Section 63. Thirdly, such \"adoption\" is only if such tariff has been determined through a transparent process of bidding, and, fourthly, this transparent process of bidding must be in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government. What has been argued before us is that Section 63 is a stand alone provision and has to be construed on its own terms, and that, therefore, in the case of transparent bidding nothing can be looked at except the bid itself which must accord with guidelines issued by the Central Government. One thing is immediately clear, that the appropriate Commission does not act as a mere post office under Section 63. It must adopt the tariff which has been determined through a transparent process of bidding, but this can only be done in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government. Guidelines have been issued under this Section on 19'h January, 2005, which guidelines have been amended from time to time. Clause 4, in particular, deals with tariff and the appropriate Commission certainly has the jurisdiction to look into whether the tariff determined through the process of bidding accords with clause 4. 19. It is impot1ant to note that the regulatory powers of the Central Commission, so far as tariff is concerned, are specifically mentioned in Section 79(1 ). This regulatory power is a general one, and it is very difficult to state that when the Commission adopts tariff under Section 63, it functions de hors its general regulatory power under Section 79(l)(b). For one thing, such regulation takes place under the Central Government's guidelines. For another, in a situation where there are no guidelines or in a situation which is not covered by the guidelines, can it be said that the Commission's power to \"regulate\" tariff is completely - done away with? According to us, this is not a correct way of reading the aforesaid statutory provisions. The first rule of statutoty interpretation is that the statute must be read as a whole. As a concomitant of that rule, it is also clear that all the discordant notes struck by the various Sections must be harmonized. Considering the fact that the non-obstante clause advisedly restricts itself to Section 62, we see no good reason to put Section 79 out of the way altogether. The reason why Section 62 alotie has been put out of the way is that determination of tariff can take place in one of two ways - either under Section 62, where the Commission itself determines the tariff in accordance with the provisions of the Act, (after laying down the terms and conditions for determination ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.) of tariff mentioned in Section 61) or under Section 63 where the Commission adopts tariff that is already determined by a transparent process of bidding. In either case, the general regulatory power of the Commission under Section 79( I )(b) is !he source of the power to regulate, which includes the power to determine or adopt tariff. In fact, Sections 62 and 63 deal with \"determination\" of tariff, which is part of\"regulating\" taril'L Whereas \"determining\" tariff for inter-State transmission of electricity is dealt with by Section 79( I)( d), Section 79( I )(b) is a wider source of power to \"regulate\" tariff. It is clear that in a situation where the guidelines issued by the ·central Government under Section 63 cover the situation, the Central Commission is bound by those guidelines and must exercise its regulatory functions, albeit under Section 79( I )(b ), only in accordance with those guidelines. As has been stated above, it is only in a situation where there are no guidelines framed at all or where the gµidelines do not deal with a given situation that the Commission's general regulatory powers under Section 79( I )(b) can then be used. Jurisdiction of the Central Commission 20. The appellants have argued before us that the expression \"composite scheme\" mentioned in Section 79(1) must necessarily be a scheme in which there is uniformity of tariff under a PPA where there is generation and s_ale of electricity in more than one State. It is not enough that generation and sale of electricity in more than one State be the 'subject matter of one or more PPAs, but that something more is necessary, namely, that there must be a composite scheme for the same. 21. In order to appreciate and deal with this submission, It is necessary to set out Section 2(5) of the Act which defines appropriate Government as follows: \"2. Definitions. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, (5) \"Appropriate Government\" means, - (a) the Central Government, - 181 A c D E F (i) in respect of a generating company wholly or partly owned by G it; (ii) in relation to any inter-State generation, transmission, trading or supply of electricity and with respect to any mines, oil-fields, railways, national highways, airports, telegraphs, broadcasting H 182 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R.

Inter-State, regional and i11ter-regio1ial transmission. For the purposes of this Pai1, the Central Government may, make region-wise demarcation of the country, and, from time to time, make such modifications therein as it may consider necessary for the efficient, economical and integrated transmission and supply of electricity, and in particular to facilitate voluntary interconnections and co-ordination of facilities for the inter-State, regional and inter-regional generation and transmission of electricity. 30. Transmission 'yithin a State. The State Commission shall facilitate and promote transmission, wheeling and inter-connection arrangements within its territorial jurisdiction for the transmission and supply of electricity by economical and efficient utilisation of the electricity.\" 22. The scheme that emerges from these Sections is that whenever there is inter-State generation or supply of electricity, it is the Central Government that is involved, and whenever there is intra-State generation or supply of electricity, the State Government or the State Commission is involved. This is the precise scheme of the entire Act, including Sections 79 and 86. It will be seen that Section 79( I) itself in sub- sections ( c ), ( d) and ( e) speaks of inter-State transmission and inter- State operations. This is to be contrasted with Section 86 which deals with functions of the State Commission which uses the expression \"within the State\" in sub-clauses (a), (b ), and ( d), and \"intra-state\" in sub-clause · (c). This being the case; it is clear that the Pl'A. which deals with generation and supply of electricity, will either have to be governed by ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] the State Commission or the Central Commission. The State Commission's jurisdiction is only where generation and supply takes place within the State. On the other hand, the moment generation and sale takes place in more than one State, the Central Commission becomes the appropriate Commission under the Act. What is important to. remember is that if We were to accept the argument Oil behalf of the appellant, and we were to hold in theAdani case that there is no composite scheme for generation and sale, as argued by the appellant, it would be clear that neither Commission would have jurisdiction, something which would lead to absurdity. Since generation and sale of electricity is in more than one State obviously Section 86 does not get attracted. This being the case, we are constrained to observe that the expression \"composite scheme\" does not mean anything more than a scheme for generation and sale of electricity in more than one State .. 23. This also follows from the dictionary meaning [(Mc-Graw- Hill Dictionary of Scientific ang Technical Terms (6'11 Edition), and P.Ramanatha Aiyar's Advanced Law Lexicon (3'd Edition)l of the expression \"composite\": (a) 'Composite' - \"A re-recording consisting of at least two elements. A material that results when two or more materials, each having its own, usually different characteristics, are combined, giving useful properties for ;pecific applications. Also known as composite material.\" (b) 'Composite character' - \"A character that is produced by two or more characters one on top of the other.\" (c) 'Composite unit\" - \"A unit made of diverse elements.\" The aforesaid dictionary definitions lead to the conclusion that the expression \"composite\" only means \"consisting ofat least two elements\". In ·the context of the present case, generation and sale being in more _than one State, this could be referred to as \"composite\". 24. Even otherwise, the expression used in Section 79(1 )(b) is that generating companies must enter into or otherwise have a \"composite scheme\". This makes it clear that the expression \"composite scheme\" does not have some special meaning - it is enough that generating companies have, in any manner, a scheme for generation and sale of electricity which must be in •'lore tha11 one State. 183 A B c D E F G H 184 A B c D E F G H ·SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. 25. We must also hasten to add that the appellant's argumen.t that there must be commonality and uniformity in tariff for a \"composite scheme\" does not follow from the Section. 26. Another important facet of dealing with this argument is that the tariff policy dated 6 1 h June, 2006 is the statutory policy which is enunciated under Section 3 of the Electricity Act. The amendment of 28'11 January, 2016 throws considerable light on the expression \"composite scheme\", which has been defined for the first time as follows: \"5. 11 (j) Composite Scl1e111e: Sub-section (b) of Section 79( I) of the Act provides that Central Commission shall regulate the tariff of generating company, if such generating company enters into or otherwise have a composite scheme for generation and sale of electricity in more than one State. Explanation: The composite scheme as specified under section 791) of the Act shall mean a scheme by a generating company for generation and sale of electricity in more than one State, having signed long-term or medium-term PPA prior to the date of commercial operation of the project (the COD of the last unit of the project will be deetned to be the date of commercial operation· of the project) for sale of at least I 0% of the capacity of the project to a distribution licensee outside the State in which such project is located.\" 27. That this definition is an important aid tq the construction of Section 79( 1 )(b) cannot be doubted and, according to us, correctly brings out the meaning of this expression as meaning nothing more than a scheme by a generating company for generation and sale of electricity in more than one State. Section 64(5) has been relied upon by the Appellant as an indicator that the State Commission hasjurisdiction even in cases where tariff for inter-State supply is involved. This provision begins with a non-obstante clause which would indicate that in all cases involving inter-State supply, transmission, o(wheeling of electricity, the Oo:ntral Commissio11 alone has jurisdiction. Jn fact this further supports the.case of the Respondents. Section 64(5) 1:.111 only apply if, the jurisdiction otherwise being with the Central Cummission alone, by application of the parties concerned, jurisdiction is to be given to the State Commission havingju'risdiction in respect of the licensee who intends to distribute and make payment for electricity. We, therefore, hold that the Central ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY 185 REGULATORY COMMIS.SION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] Commission had the necessary jurisdiction to embark upon the issues A raised in the present cases. Force Majeure 28. A large part of the argument turned on the finding of the Appellate Tribunal that the rise in price of coal consequent to change in Indonesian law would be a force majeure event which would entitle the respondents to claim .compensatory tariff. Before embarking on the merits of this claim, we must first advert to the argument of the appellant that force majeure can only be argued for a very restricted purpose, as has been pointed out in the Supreme Court judgment dated 31st March, 2015. 29. In order to appreciate this contention, it is first necessary to set out the relevant portion of this judgment. By the judgment dated 31st March, 2015, this Cou11 held: \"13. By order dated 1-8-2014, the Appellate Tribunal dismissed B c the cross-objections of the appellant herein as not maintainable. D On 16-9-2014, the appellant preferred Appeal No. DFR No. 2355 of2014 before the Appellate Tribunal against that part of the order dated 2-4-2013 which went against the appellant. Obviously, there was a delay in preferring that appeal. Therefore, the appellant filed an application bearing IA No. 380of2014 seeking condonation E of delay in preferring the appeal which was' rejected by the impugned order. Hence, the instant appeal. 14. The issue before this Court is limited. It is the correctness of the decision of the Appellate Tribunal in declining to condone the delay in preferring the appeal against the order dated 2-4-2013 of the Central Commission. 15. However, elaborate submissions were made regarding the scope of Order 41 Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short \"CPC\"), and its applicability to an appeal under Section 111 of the Act by the appellant relying upon earlier decisions of this Court. The respondents submitted that such an enquiry is wholly uncalled for as the cross-objections of the appellant in Appeal No. I 00 of2013 stood rejected and became final. F G H 186 A B c D E F G H SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. 16. Lastly, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that even if this Court comes to the conclusion that the appellant has not made out a case for condonation of delay in preferring an appeal against the order dated 2-4-2013 of the Central Commission, the appellant is entitled to argue in the pending Appeals Nos. 98 and 116of2014 both the grounds of\"force majeure\" and \"change of law\" not for the purpose of seeking the relief of a declaration of the frustration of the contracts between the appellants and the respondents, thereby relieving the appellant of his obligations arising out of the contracts, but only for the purpose of seeking the alternative relief of compensatory tariff. In other words, the appellant's submission is that the facts which formed the ba.sis of the submission of the frustration of contracts are also relevant for supporting the conclusion of the National Commission that the appel I ant is entitled for the relief of compensatory tariff. 17. We agree with the respondents that we are not required to go into the question of the applicability of Order 41 Rule 22 in the instant appeal as the decision of the Appellate Tribunal to reject the cross-objections of the appellant by its order dated 1-8-2014 has become final and no appeal against the said order is pending before us. 18. We are also not required to go into the question whether the order of the Central Commission dated 2~4-2013 by which it declined to grant a declaration of frustration of the contracts either on the ground of \"force majeure\" or on the ground of \"change of law\" is independently appealable, since no such appeal even if maintainable, is preferred by the appellant. 19. The question whether the appellant made out a case for condonation of delay in preferring the appeal before the Appellate Tribunal, in our opinion, need not also be examined by us in view of the last submission made by the appellant. If the appellant is not desirous of seeking a declaration that the appel !ant is relieved of the obligation to perform the contracts in question, the correctness of the decision of the Appellate Tribunal in rejecting the application to condone the delay in preferring the appeal would become purely academic. We are of the opinion that so long as the appellant does not seek a declaration, such as the one mentioned above, the appellant is entitled to argue any proposition of law, be ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J .] it \"force majeure\" or \"cha11ge of law\" in suppo1t of the order dated 21-2-20 I 4 quantifying the compensatory tariff, the correctness of which is under challenge before the Appel late Tribunal in Appeal No. 98 of 2014 and Appeal No. I I 6 of 2014 preferred by the respondents, so long as ;rnch an argument is based on the facts which are already pleaded before the Central Commission.\" 30. This Court dealt with an appeal arising out of an order of the Appellate Tribunal dated 31st October, 2014, in which the Appellate Tribunal declined to condone a delay of 481 days in preferring an appeal against an order dated 2\"d April, 2013. 31. As has been stated by this Cou1t, the issue before .the Comt was limited. This Court held that the appellant is entitled to argue force majeure and change in law in pending Appeals Nos.98 and 116 of20 I 4. This was because what was concluded by the Central Commission was force majeure and change of law for the purpose· of seeking the relief of declaration of frustration of the contract between the appellant and the respondents, thereby relieving the appellant of its obligations arising out of the contract. Since the appellant was not desirous of seeking a declaration that the appellant is relieved of the obligation of performing the contract in question, the appellant is entitled to argue force majeure or change of law in suppo11 of the Commission's order of2 I st February, 2014, which quantified compensatory tariff, the correctness of which is under challenge in Appeal Nos.98 a11d 116of2014. This being the case, it is clear that this Court did not give any truncated right to argue force maJeure or change of law. This Court explicitly stated that both force majeure and change of law can be argued in all its plenitude to support an order quantifying compensatory tariff so long as the appel !ants do not claim that they are relieved of performance of the PPAs altogether. This being the case, we are of the view that the preliminary submission of the appellant before us is without any force. Accordingly, the Appellate Tribunal rightly went into force majeure and change of law. 32. \"Force majeure\" is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. In so far as it is relatable to an express or implied clause in a contract, such as the PPAs before us, it is governed by Chapter III dealing with the contingent contracts, and more particularly, Section 32 thereof. In so far as a force maje.ure event occurs de hors the contract, it is dealt with by a rule of positive law under Section 56 of the Contract. Sections 187 A 8 c D E F G H 188 Su'PREME COURT REPORTS [20171 3 S.C.R. A 32 and 56 are set out herein: \"32. Enforcement of Contracts contingent on an event happening - Contingent contracts to do or.not to do anything if an uncertain future event happens, cannot be enforced by law unless and until that e\\ cnt has happened. If the event becomes B impossible, such contracts become void. c D E F G H 56. Agreement to do impossible act - An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void. Contract to do act afterwards becoming impossible or unlawful. A contract to do an act which, after the contract made, becomes impossible or, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when t!1e act becomes impossible or unlawful. Compensation for loss through non-performance of act known to be impossible or unlawful. Where one person has promised to do something which he knew or, with reasonable diligence, might have known, and which the promisee did not know, to be impossible or unlawful, such promisor must make compensation to such promise for any loss which such promisee sustains through the non-performance of the promise.\" 33. Prior to the decision in Taylor vs. Calli\\\\ ell, (1861-73) All ER Rep 24, the law in England was extremely rigid. A contract had to be performed, notwithstanding the fact that it had become impossible of performance, owing to some unforeseen event, after it was made, which was not the fault of either of the parties to the contract. This rigidity of the common law in which the absolute sanctity of contract was upheld was loosened somewhat by tl1e decision in Taylor vs. Caldwell in which it was held that if some unforeseen event occurs during the performance of a contract which makes it impossible. of performance, in the sense that the fundamental basis of the contract goes, it need not be further . performed, as insisting upon such performance would be unjust. 34. The law in India has been laid down in the seminal decision of Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur & Co., 1954 SCR 310. The second paragraph of Section 56 has been adverted to, and it was stated that this is exhaustive of the law as it stands in India. What was held was that the word \"impossible\" has not been used in the Section in ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION ~R. F. NARIMAN, J.] the sense of physical or literal impossibility. The performance ofan act may not be literally impossible but it may be nfipracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and purpose of the parti';!s. If an untoward event\" or change of circumstance totally upsets the very foundation upon which the parties entered their agreement, it can be said that the promisor finds it impossible to do the act which he had promised to do. It was further held that where the Court finds that the .contract itself either impliedly or expressly contains a term, according to which performance would stand discharged under certain circumstances, the.dissolution of the contract would take place under the terms of the contract itself and such cases would be dealt with under Section 32 of the Act. If, however, frustration is to take place de hors the contract, it will be governed by Section 56. 3 S. In Mis Alo pi Parshad & Sons Ltd. v. Union of India, 1960 (2) SCR 793, this Court, after setting out Section 56 of the Contract Act, held that the Act does not enable a party to a contract .to igi1ore the express covenants thereof and to claim payment of considerntion, for performance of the contract at rates different from the stipulated rates, on a vague plea of equity. Parties to an executable ~ontract !\\re often faced, in the course of carrying it out, with a turn of events which they did not at all anticipate; for example, a wholly abnormal rise or fall in prices which is an unexpected obstacle to execution. This does not in itself get rid of the bargain they have made. It is only when a consideration of the terms of the contract, in the light of the circumstances existing when it was made, showed that they never agreed to be bound in a fundamentally different situation which had unexpectedly emerged, that the contract ceases to bind. It was further held that the performance of a contract is never discharged merely becallse it may become onerous to one of the parties. 36. Similarly, in Naihati Jute Mills Ltd. v. Hyaliram Jagannath, 1968 (1) SCR 821, this Col!rt went into the English law on frus~ration in some detail, and then cited the celebrated judgment of Satyabrata Gl10se v. Mugneeram Bangur & Co. Ultimately, this Court concluded that a contract is not frustrated merely because the circumstances in which it was made are altered. The Courts have no general power to absolve a party from the performan~e ofits part of the contract merely because ' its performance has become onerous on account of an unforeseen tum of events. 1.89 A B c D E F G H 190 A B c D E F G H SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. 37. It has also been held that applying the doctrine of frustration must always be within narrow limits. In an instructive English judgment namely, Tsakiroglou & Co. Ltd. v. Noblee Thor! Gmbll, 1961 (2) All ER 179, despite the closure of the Suez canal, and despite the fact that the customary route for shipping the goods was only through the Suez canal, it was held that the contract of sale of groundnuts in that case was not frustrated, even though it would have to be performed by an alternative mode of performance which was much more expensive, namely, that the ship would now have to go around the Cape of Good Hope, which is three times the distance from Hamburg to Port Sudan. The freight for such journey was also double. Despite this, the House of Lords held that even though the contract had become more onerous to perform, it was not fundamentally altered. Where performance is otherwise possible, it is clear that a mere rise in freight price wou Id not allow one of the _parties to say that the contract was discharg~o by impossibility of performance. 38. This view of the law has been echoed in 'Chitty on Contracts', 31\" edition. In paragraph 14-151 a rise in cost or expense has been stated not to frustrate a contract. Similarly, in 'Treitel on Frustration and Force Majeure', )'d edition, the learned author has opined, at paragraph 12-034, that the cases provide many illustrations of the principle that a force majeure clause will not normally be construed to apply where the contract provides for an alternative mode of performance. It is clear that a more onerous method of performance by itself would not amount to an frustrating event. The same learned author also states that a mere rise in price rendering the contract more expensive to perform does not constitute frustration. (See paragraph 15-158) 39. Indeed, in England, in the celebrated Sea Angel case, 2013 (1) Lloyds Law Report 569, the modernapproach to frustration is well put, and the same reads as under: \"111. In my judgment, the application of the doctrine of frustration requires a multi-factorial approach. Among the factors which have to be considered are the terms of the contract itself, its matrix or context, the patties' knowledge, expectations, assumptions and contemplations; in particular as to risk, as atthe time of the contract, at any rate so far as these can be ascribed mutually and objectively, and then the nature of the supervening event, and the parties' reasonable and objectively ascertainable calculations as to the ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] possibilities offuture performance in the new circumstances. Since the subject matter of the doctrine of frustration is contract, and contracts are about the allocation ofrisk, and since the allocation and assumption of risk is not simply a matter of express or implied provision but may also depend on less easily defined matters such as \"the contemplation of the parties\", the application of the doctrine can often be a difficult one. Jn such circumstances, the test of \"radically different\" is important: it tells us that the doctrine is not to be lightly invoked; that mere incidence of expense or delay or onerousness is not sufficient; and that there has to be as it were a break in identity between the c011tract as provided for and contemplated and its performance in the new circumstances.\" 40. It is clear from the above thatthe doctrine of frustration cannot apply to these cases as the fundamental basis of the PPAs remains unaltered. Nowl1ere do the PPAs state that coal is to be procured only from Indonesia at a particular price. In fact, it is clear on a r(;ading of the PPA as a whole that the price payable for the supply of coal is entirely for the person wJ10 sets up the power plant to bear. The fact that the fuel supply agreement has to be appended to the PPA is only to indicate that the raw material for the working of the plant is there and is in order. It is clear that an unexpected rise in the price of coal will not absolve the generating companies from performing their part of the contract for the very good reason that when they submitted their bids, this was a risk they knowingly took. We are of the view that the mere fact that the bid may be non-escalable does not mean that the respondents are precluded from raising the plea of frustration, ifotherwise it is available in law and can be pleaded by them. But the fact that a non-escalable tariff has been paid for, for example, in the Adani case, is a factor which may be taken into account only to show that the risk of supplying electricity at the tariff in~icated was upon the generating company. 41. Coming to the PPAs themselves, we find that the force majeure clause contained in all of them is in a standard form and is as. follows: \"12.3 Force Majeure 'Force Majeure' means any event or circumstance or combination of events and circumstances including those stated below that wholly or patily prevents or unavoidably delays an · 191 A B c D E F G H 192 A B c D E F G H SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R.

It has strongly been contended by counsel for the respondents that, first and foremost, the force rnajcure clause is not exhaustive, but is only inclusive. Further, it may wholly or partly prevent an affected party from performance of obligations under the agreement. Rise in the price oflndonesian coal, according to them, was unforeseen inasmuch as the PPAs have been entered into sometime in 2006 to 2008, and the rise in price took place only in 20 I 0 and 2011. Such rise in price is also not within their control at all and, therefore, clause 12.3 read with clause 12. 7 would apply. They further argued that the force majeure clause in the present case went further and stated that so long as performance of their obligation was \"hindered\" due to a force majeure event, they can claim compensatory tariff. 43. First and foremost, the respondents are correct in stating that the force majeure clause does not exhaust the possibility of unforeseen events occurring outside natural and/or non-natural events. But the thrust of their argument was really that so long as their performance is hindered by an unforeseen event, the clause applies. 'Chitty on Contracts', 31\" edition at para 14-151 cites a number of judgments for the proposition that the expression \"hindered\" must be construed with regard to words which precede and follow it, and also with regard to the nature and general terms of the contract. Given the fact that the PPA must be read as a whole, and that clauses 12.3 and 12. 7(a) are a part of the same scheme of force majeure under the contract, it is clear that the expression \"hindered\" in clause 12. 7(a) really goes with the expression \"partly prevents\" in clause 12.3. Force majeure clauses are to be narrowly construed, and obviously the expression \"prevents\" in clause 12.3 is spoken of also in clause 12.7(a). When \"prevent\" is preceded by the expression \"wholly or partly\", it is reasonable to assume that the expression \"prevented\" in clause 12. 7(a) goes with the expression \"wholly\" in clause 12.3 and the expression \"hindered\" in clause 12.7(a) goes with the expression \"partly\". This being so, it is clear that there must be something which partly prevents the performance of the obligation under the agreement. Also, 'Treitel on Frustration and Force Majeure', ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] 3rd edition, in paragraph 15-158 cites the English judgment ofTennants (Lancashire) Ltd. v. G.S. Wilson and Co. Ltd., 1917 Appeal Cases 495 for the proposition that a mere rise in price rendering the contract more expensive to perform will not constitute \"hindrance\". This is echoed in the celebrated judgment of Peter Dixon & Sons Ltd. v. Henderson, Craig & Co. Ltd., 1919(2) KB 778 in which it was held that the expression \"hinders the delivery\" in a contract would only be attracted if there was not merely a question of rise in price, but a serious ·hindrance in performance of the contract.as a whole. At the beginning of the First World War, British ships were no longer available, and although foreign shipping could be obtained at an increased freight, such foreign ships were liable to be captured by the enemy and destroyed through mines or sub-marines, and could be detained by British or allied warships. In the circumstances, the Tennants (Lancashire) Ltd. judgment was applied, and the Cou11 of Appeals held: \"Under the circumstances, can it be said that the sellers were not \"hindered or prevented\" within the meaning of the contract? It is not a question of price, merely an increase of freight. Tonnage had to be obtained to bring the pulp in Scandinavian ships, and although the difficulty in obtaining tonnage may be reflected in the increase of freight, it was not a mere ·matter of increase of freight; if so, there were standing contracts that ought to have been fulfilled. Counsel for the respondents urged that certain shipowners, for reasons of their own, chose not to fulfil standing contracts. It was not only shipowners but pulp buyers and sellers. The whole trade was dislocated, by reason of the difficulty that had arisen in tonnage. It seems to me that the language of Lord Dunedin in Tennants, Ld. v. Wilson & Co. is applicable to the present case: \"Where I think, with deference to the learned judges, the majority of the Court below have gone wrong is that they have seemingly assumed that price was the only drawback. I do not think that price as price has anything to do with it. Price may be evidence, but it is only one of many kinds of evidence as to shortage. If the appellants had alleged nothing but advanced price they would have failed. But they have shown much more.\" That is exactly so here. Price, as price only, would not have affected it. They were all standing contracts, but the position has so changed by reason of the war that buyers and sellers and the whole trade 197 A B c D E F G I-I 198 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (2017) 3 S.C.R. A were hindered or prevented from carrying out those contracts.\" 44. As a matter of fact, clause 12.4 of the PPA, which deals with force majeure exclusions, reads as follows: \"12.4 I<orce Majcure .Exclusions B Force Majeure shall not include (i) any event or circumstance which is within the reasonable control of the parties and (ii) the following conditions, except to the extent that they are consequences of an event of Force Majeure: a. Unavailability, late delivery, or changes in cost of the plant, C machine1y, equipment, materials, spare parts, fuel or consumables for Jhe Project; b. Delay in the performance of any contractor, sub-c;ontractors or their agents excluding the conditions as mentioned in A11icle I 2.2; c. Non-performance resulting from normal wear and tear typically D experienced in power generation materials and equipment; E F G H d. Strikes or labour disturbance at the facilities of the Affected Party; e. Insufficiency of finances or funds or the agreement becoming onerous to perform; and f. Non-performance caused by, or connected with, the Affected Party's: i. Negligent or intentional acts, errors or omissions; ii. Failure to comply with an Indian Law; or iii. Breach of, or default under this Agreement or any Project Documents.\" This clause makes it clear that changes in the cost of fuel, or the agreement becoming onerous to perform, are not treated as force majeure events under the PPA itself. 45. We are, therefore, of the view that neither was the fundan1ental basis of the contract dislodged nor was any frustrating event, except for a rise in the price of coal, excluded by clause 12.4, pointed out. Alternative modes of performance were available, albeit at a higher price. This does not lead to the contract, as a whole, being frustrated. ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMf..N, J.] Consequently, we are of the view that neither clause 12.3 nor 12.7, referable to Section 32 oft he Contract Act, will apply so as to enable the grant of compensatory tariff to the respondents. Dr. Singhvi, however, argued that even if clause 12 is held inapplicable, the law laid down on frustration under Section 56 will apply so as to give the respondents the necessary relief on the ground of force majeure. Having once held that clause 12.4 applies as a result of which rise in the price offuel cannot be regarded as a force majeure event contractually, it is difficult to appreciate a submission that in the alternative Section 56 will apply. As has been held in particular, in the Satyabrata Ghose case, when a contract contains a force majeure clause which on construction by the Court is held attracted to the facts of the case, S.ection 56 can have no application. On this short ground, this alternative submission stands disposed of. Change in Law 46. It has been submitted on behalf of the counsel for the respondents, that the guidelines of 19'h Janua1y, 2005, as amended by the 18'h August, 2006 amendment, make it clear that any change in law, either abroad or in India, would result in the consequential rise in price of coal being given to the power generators.

The respondents have argued before us that it is c I ear from the change made in clause 4.7 of the guidelines read with clause 5.17 that any change in law impacting cost or revenue from the business of selling electricity shall be adjusted separately. Learned counsel for the respondents have argued that \"any change in law\" is not qualified and, therefore, would include foreign law. According to them, the power purchase agreement is subservient to the guidelines and can never negate the tenns of the guidelines. Under clauses 4. 7 and 5. l.7 of the guidelines, these guidelines are binding on all parties including the procurers and any deviation therefrom has to be approved by the appropriate Commission. Therefore, according to them, the PPA must be read as including foreign laws as well. On the other hand, our attention was invited to the definition of\"electricity laws\" and it was argued that clause 13 would have to be read in the light of the PPA provisions and so read it would not include changes in Indonesian law, being foreign and not Indian Law. 48. Both the guidelines and tlie model PPA, of which clause 13 is a part, have been drafted by the Central Government itself. It is, therefore, clear that the PPA only fleshes out what is mentioned in clause 4.7 of the guidelines, and goes on to explain what the expression \"any ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] change in law\" means. This being the case, it is clear that the definition of \"law\" speaks of all laws including elecfricity laws in force in India. Electricity laws, as has been seen from the definition, means the Electricity Act, rules and regulations made thereunder from time to time, and any other law pertaining to electricity. This being so, it is clear that the expression \"in force in India\" in the definition of 'law' goes with \"all laws\". This is for the reason that otherwise the said expression would become tautologous, as electricity laws that are in force in India are already referred to in the definition of\"electricity laws\" as contained in the PPA. Once this is clear, at least textually it is clear that \"all laws\" would have to be read with \"in force in India\" and would, therefore, refer only to Indian laws. Even otherwise, from a reading of clause 13, it is clear that clause 13.1.1 is in four different parts. The first part speaks of enacted laws; the second speaks of interpretation of such laws by Courts or other instrumentalities; the third speaks of changes in consents, approvals or licences which result in change in cost of the business of selling electricity; and the fou1th refers to any change in the declared law of the land for the project, cost of implementation of re- settlement and rehabilitation or cost of implementing the environmental management plan. 'Competent Court' in clause 13.1.2 is defined as meaning only the judicial system of India. 49. First and foremost, the expression \"any law\" occurs in both sub-section ( 1) and sub-section (2) of clause 13. I. I, which expression must be given the same meaning in both sub-sections. This being the case, as in sub-clause (2), this expression would refer only to Indian law, the same meaning will have to be given to the very same expression in sub-clause (1 ). Even otherwise, sub-clauses (I) and (2) form part of the -same contractual scheme in that sub-clause (I) refers to the enactment of laws, whereas sub-clause (2) relates to interpretation of those very laws by a competent Court of law/Tribunal or Indian Government instrumentality. 'Competent Cou1t', as we have seen above, speaks only of the Indianjudieial system and, therefore, the enactments spoken of in sub-clause (I) would necessarily refer only to Indian enactments. 50. However, we were referred to other clauses in the PPA, for example, clauses 12.4(f)(ii), 4.1.l(a) and 17.1, all of which speak of Indian law. It was, therefore, argued that wherever the parties wanted to refer to Indian law, they did so explicitly, ai1d from this it should be 207 A B c D E F G 1-1 208 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (2017] 3 S.C.R. A inferred that the expression \"law\" would otherwise include all laws whether Indian or otherwise. 51. This argument is based on the Latin maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. This maxim has been referred to in a number of judgments of this Court in which it has been described as a 'useful servant B but a dangerous master'. (See for example CCE v. National Tobacco Co. of India Ltd., ( 1972) 2 SCC 560 at Para 30). From a reading of the above, it is clear that if otherwise the expression \"any law\" in clause 13 when read with the definition of\"law\" and \"Electricity Laws\" leads unequivocally to the conclusion that it refers c only to the law oflndia, it would be unsafe to rely upon the other clauses of the agreement where Indian law is specifically mentioned to negate this conclusion. 52. It was also argued, placing reliance upon the fact that a commercial contract is to be interpreted in a manner which gives business D efficacy to such contract, that the subject matter of the PPA being \"impo1ted coal\", obviously the expression \"any law\" would refer to laws governing coal that is impo1ted from other countries. We are afraid, we cannot agree with this argument. There are many PPAs entered into with different generators. Some generators may source fuel only from India. Others, as is the case in the Adani Ha1yana matter, would source E fuel to the extent of 70% from India and 30% from abroad, whereas other generators, as in the case of Gujarat Adani and the Coastal case, would source coal wholly from abroad. The meaning of the expression \"change in law\" in clause 13 cannot depend upon whether coal is sourced in a particular PPA from outside India or within India. The meaning will F have to remain the same whether coal is sourced wholly in India, paitly in lndia and partly from outside, or wholly from outside. This being the case, the i11eaning of the expression \"any law\" in clause 13 cannot possibly be interpreted in the manner suggested by the respondents. English judgments and authorities were cited for the proposition that if performance of a contract is to be done in a foreign country, what would G be relevant would be foreign law. This would be true as a general statement of law, but for the reason given above, would not apply to the PPAs in the present case. H 53. However, in so far as the applicability of clause 13 to a change in Indian law is concerned, the respondents are on firm ground. It will ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] be seen that under clause 13.1.1 if there is a change in any consent, approval or licence available or obtained for the project, otherwise than for the default of the seller, which results in any change in any cost of the business of selling electricity, then the said seller will be governed under clause 13.1.1. It is clear from a reading of the Resolution dated 21st June, 2013, which resulted in the letter of3 I\" July, 2013, issued by the Ministry of Power. that the earlier coal distribution policy contained in the letter dated I 8 111 March, 2007 stands modified as the Government has now approved a revised arrangement for supply of coal. It has been decided that, seeing the overall domestic availability and the likely requirement of power projects, the power projects will only be entitled to a certain percentage of what w.as earlier allowable. This being the case, on 3 J.st July. 2013, the following letter, which is set out in extenso states as follows : FU-12/2011-IPC (Vol-111) Government oflndia 209 A B c Ministry of Power D To, The Secretary, Shram Shakti Bhawan, New Delhi Dated 31st July, 2013 Central Electricity Regulato1y Commission, Chanderlok Building, Janpath, New Delhi Subject: Impact on tariff in the concluded PPAs due to sho1tage in domestic coal availability and consequent changes in NCDP. E Ref. CERC's D.O. No. I 01512013-Statutory Advic,e/CERC dated F 20.05.13 Sir, In view of the demand for coal of power plants that were provided coal linkage by Govt. of India and CIL not signing any Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) after March, 2009, several meetings at different levels in the Government were held to review the situation. In February 2012, it was decided that FSAs will be signed for full quantity of coal mentioned in the Letter of Assurance (LOAs) for a period of20 years with a trigger level of 80% for levy of disincentive and 90% for levy of incentive. Subsequently, G 1-1 210 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. A MOC indicated that CIL \\\\ill not be able to supply domestic coal at 80% level of ACQ and coal will have to be imported by CIL to bridge the gap. The issue of increa)cd cost of power due to import of coal/e-auction and its impact on the tari If of concluded PPAs were also discussed and CERC's advice sought. B 2. After considering all aspects allll the advice of CERC in this regard, Government has decided the fol lowing in June 2013: i) taking into account the overall domestic availability and actual requirements, FSAs to be signed for domestic coal component for the levy of disincentive at the quantity of 65%, 65%, 67% and c 75% of Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) for the remaining four years of the 12 1 \" Plan. ii) to meet its balance FSA obligations, CIL may import coal and supply the same to the willing TPPs on cost plus basis. TPPs may also impo11 coal themselves if they so opt. D iii) higher coJt of imported coal to be considered for pass through as per modalities suggested by CERC. 3. Ministry of Coal vide letter dated 261 h July 2013 has notified the changes in the New CQ\\11 Distribution Policy (NCDP) as approved by the CCEA in relation to be·coal supply for the next four years E of the 12th Plan (copy enclosed). 4. As per decision of the Government. the higher cost of import/ market based e-auction coal be considered for being made a pass through on a case to case basis by CERC/SERC to the extent of sho1tfall in the quantity indicated in the LoA/FSA and the CIL F supply of domestic coal which would be minimum of 65%, 65%, 67% and 75% of LOA for the remaining four years of the 12th Plan for the already concluded PPAs based on tariff based competitive bidding. 5. The ER Cs are advised to consider the request of individual G power producers in this regard as per due process 011 a case to case basis in public interest. The Appropriate Commissions are requested to take immediate steps for the implementation of the above decision of the Govern111cnt. · This issues 11 ilh the approval of MOS(P)l/C. H. ENERGY WATCHDOG v. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY 211 REGULATORY COMMISSION [R. F. NARIMAN, J.] Encl: as above A Yours faithfully, Sd/- (V.Apparao) Director This is fu11her reflected in the revised tariff policy dated 281 h January, 2016, which in paragraph I .I states as under: I. I In compliance with Section 3 of the Electricity Act 2003, the Central Government notified the Tariff Policy on 6 1 h January, 2006. B Further amendments to the Tariff Pol icy were notified on 31\" C March, 2008, 20'h January, 2011 and 8 1h July, 2011. In exercise.of powers conferred under Section 3(3) of Electricity Act, 2003, the .Central Government hereby notifies the revised Tariff Pol icy to be effective from the date of publication of the resolution in the Gazette of India. Notwithstanding anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken under the provisions of the Tariff -· Policy notified on 61h January, 2006 and amendments made thereunder, shall, in so far as it is not inconsistent with this Policy, be deemed to have been done or taken under provisions of this D revised policy. E Clause 6.1 states: 6.1 Procurement of Power As stipulated in para 5.1, power procurement for future requirements should be through a transparent competitive bidding mechanism using the guidelines issued by the Central Government from time to time. These guidelines provide for procurement of electricity separately for base load requirements and for peak load requirements. This would facilitate setting up of generation capacities specifically for meeting such requirements. However, some of the competitively bid projects as per the guidelines dated I 9 1 h January, 2005 have experienced difficulties in getting the required quantity of coal from Coal India Limited (CIL). In case ofreduced quantity of domestic coal supplied by CIL, vis-a-vis the assured quantity or quantity indicated in Letter F G H 212 A B c D E F G H SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2017] 3 S.C.R. of Assurance/FSA the·cost of imported/market based e-auction coal procured for making up the shortfall, shall be considered for being made a pass through by Appropriate Commission on a case to case basis, as per advisory issucu by Ministry of Power vide OM NO.FU-12/2011-!PC (Vol-Ill) dated 31.7.2013. Both the letter dated 31\" July, 20 I 3 and the revised tariff policy are statutory documents being issued under Section 3 of the Act and have the force of law. This being so, it is clear that so far as the procurement of Indian coal is concerned, to the extent that the supply from Coal India and other Indian sources is cut down, the PPA read with these documents provides in clause I 3.2 that while determining the consequences of change in law, parties shall have due regard to the principle that the purpose of compensating the party affected by such change in law is to restore, through monthly tariff payments, the affected party to the economic position as if such change in law has not occurred. Further, for the operation period of the PPA, compensation for any increase/decrease in cost to the seller shall be determined and be effective from such date as decided by the Central Electricity Regulation Commission. This being the case, we are of the view that though change in Indonesian law would not qualify as a change in law under the guidelines read with the PPA, change in Indian law certainly would. 54. However, Shri Ramachandran, learned senior counsel for the appellants, argued that the policy dateu I S•h October, 2007 was announced even before the effective date of the PPAs, and made it clear to all generators that coal may not be given to the extent of the entire quantity allocated. We are afraid that we cannot accede to this argument for the reason that the change in law has only taken place only in 2013, which modifies the 2007 pol icy and to the extent that it does so, relief is available under the PPA itself to persons who source supply of coal from indigenous sources. It is to this limited extent that change in law is held in favour of the respondents. Certain other minor contentions that are raised on behalf of both sides are not being addressed by us for the reason that we find it unnecessary to go into the same. The Appel late Tribunal's judgment and the Commission's orders fol lowing the said judgment are set aside. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission will, as a result of this judgment, go into the matter afresh and determine what relief should be granted to those power generators who fall with in clause I 3 of the PPA as has been held by us in this judgment.
