The Judgment of the High Court was delivered by ANUJA PRABHUDESSAI, J.- By this application filed under Section 482 CrPC the applicant has prayed for quashing and setting aside the order dated 30-12-2014, discharging Respondent 1, one of the accused in Sessions Cases Nos. 177, 178 and 577 of2013 and 312 of2014 pending in the Sessions Court, Greater Bombay at Mumbai. The applicant has also sought to direct an independent agency to investigate the circumstances under which Rubabbuddin Shaikh, the applicant in Criminal Revision Application (St.) No. 413 of 2015, has approached this Court for withdrawal of the said revision application and the application for condonation of delay. 3. The brief facts necessary to decide this application are as under: Respondent 1 had filed a discharge application in the aforestated sessions cases.

The said order was not challenged by CBI, but was challenged by Rubabbuddin, the brother of the deceased Sohrabuddin, by filing Criminal Revision Application No. 413 of 2015, along with an application for condonation of delay being Criminal Application No. 355 of 2015. 4. By application dated 5-10-2015, the said Rubabbuddin had sought to withdraw the said revision application as well as the application for condonation of delay. The said application was allowed by this Court by order dated 23-11-2015. Accordingly, the application for condonation of delay was disposed of as withdrawn. Consequently, the revision application was also disposed of. 5. The applicant had filed this application during the pendency of the withdrawal application dated 5-10-2015, filed by Rubabbuddin Shaikh. The applicant claims that the crime being a gross case of custodial murder has caused violence, trauma, fear and loss not only to the interested parties, but also to the entire law-abiding society. The applicant claims that though there is sufficient prima facie material to proceed against Respondent 1, CBI did not challenge the discharge order which has resulted in abuse of process of law and gross failure of justice. The applicant claims that Rubabbuddin, the brother of the deceased Sohrabuddin, who had challenged the said order had sought to withdraw the revision application as well as the application for condonation of delay, and as such it was left to the citizens concerned to pursue the matter in order to ensure justice in the larger interest of the society. The applicant claims that withdrawal of the revision application by Rubabbuddin appears to be suspicious, under threats, inducement and promise. The applicant, who claims to be a socially responsible citizen has thus filed this application for the reliefs as stated above. 6. At the outset it may be mentioned that Mr Raju, the learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 1 has submitted that the application is liable to be dismissed for suppression of material fact and for approaching the Court with unclean hands. Elaborating this submission, the learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that this Court by order dated 21-10-2015 had dismissed a similar application filed by one Rajesh Kamble and that the applicant had suppressed the said material fact. Relying upon the decision in Ram Narang v. Ramesh Narang 1, the learned Senior Counsel for the applicant has submitted that a litigant cannot play hide and seek with the Court and must approach the Court candidly and with clean hands. 7. Whereas, the learned Senior Counsel Shri Grover has submitted that the relief sought by Shri Kamble was entirely different from the relief sought by the applicant in this case. He has submitted that the order passed in Criminal Application No. 420 of 2015 is not relevant for deciding this application. 1 (1995) 2 sec 513 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd. ~cccc® ION LINE;:' True Prinf HARSH MANDAR v. AMIT ANILCHANDRA SHAH 423 8. It is to be noted that by application dated 5-10-2015 Rubabbuddin Shaikh, the brother of the deceased Sohrabuddin had sought leave to withdraw a the said revision application as well as the application for condonation of delay. During the pendency of this application one Shri Rajesh M. Kamble, who claimed to be an alert citi zen, had filed an application being Criminal Application No. 420 of 2015, opposing withdrawal of the said application by Rubabbuddin Shaikh. The said application was dismissed by this Court on merits by order dated 21-10-2015, inter alia holding that the applicant Rajesh b Kamble was neither a victim nor an aggrieved person. It was further held that the said applicant had not demonstrated that his legal rights were impaired or that any harm, injury was caused to him or likely to be caused due to withdrawal of the application. It was therefore, held that the intervenor had no legal right to intervene in the proceedings, and accordingly the application filed by Rajesh C d e f g h Kamble was dismissed. 9. It is true that the applicant had not referred to this order in the present application. However, the same by itself would not be a ground to reject the application, moreover when the applicant has not obtained any favourable order by suppressing the said order dated 21-10-2015. The decisions relied upon by Respondent 1 are therefore distinguishable and not applicable to the facts of the case. Consequently, the application cannot be dismissed on the ground of suppression of material facts. 10. Shri S.V. Raju, the learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 1 has also raised the issue of maintainability of this application as well as the locus standi of the applicant in filing the application under Section 482 CrPC. The learned Senior Counsel for the applicant as well as the learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 1 have stated that since the issue of maintainability goes to the root of the matter, the same should be decided at the threshold. Hence both the learned Senior Counsel were heard on these preliminary objections raised by the learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 1. 11. Shri Grover, the learned Senior Counsel for the applicant has submitted that the learned Sessions Judge has discharged Respondent 1 by order dated 30-12-2014. CBI had not challenged the discharge order, hence Rubabbuddin, the brother of the deceased was compelled to file the revision application along with an application for condonation of delay. The learned Senior Counsel has submitted that since Rubabbuddin, the aggrieved party had already filed a revision application, it was not necessary for the applicant to challenge the discharge order. He has submitted that filing of withdrawal application by the aggrieved party has necessitated the applicant, a citizen concerned, to file the present application. 12. The learned Senior Counsel for the applicant has further submitted that the opening words \"Nothing in this Code ... \" in Section 482 CrPC is a non obstante clause and it has overriding effect over other provisions including Section 397(2) CrPC.

In support of this contention, he has relied upon the judgments of the Apex Court in Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra 2, Dhariwal Tobacco Products Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra 3 and Raj Kapoor v. State 4 . 13. On the issue of locus standi, the learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that the concept of locus standi is foreign to criminal jurisprudence. Relying upon the judgments of the Apex Court in A.R. Antulay v. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak 5, Subramanian Swamy v. Manmohan Singh 6 , the learned Senior Counsel Shri Grover has submitted that anyone can set the criminal law in motion and this principle remains intact unless contra indicated by statutory provision. The learned Senior Counsel has urged that when the crime is against the society it is the primary duty of the State to initiate prosecution and continue the same. Relying upon the view taken by the Apex Court in Sheonandan Paswan v. State of Bihar 7 (Bhagwati, Oza, JJ.) which has been termed as minority judgment, he has submitted that the citizen who finds that the offence against society is being wrongly withdrawn, is entitled to oppose the withdrawal. The learned Senior Counsel for the applicant therefore submits that the application is maintainable. 14. Mr Raju, the learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 1 has further submitted that the order of discharge is not an interlocutory order and that the order is revisable under Section 397 CrPC. Relying upon the decision of the Apex Court inMohit v. State of U.P. 8 , the learned Senior Counsel has submitted that the powers under Section 482 CrPC cannot be resorted to when there is specific provision in the Code for the redressal of grievance of the aggrieved party. 15. The learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 1 has submitted that though the criminal law can be set in motion by any person, the criminal law does not recognise the right of a third party or a stranger to the proceedings to participate in further proceedings and that this right is conferred only to the Slate and in some cases to the victims or to the aggrieved persons. He has placed reliance on the decisions of the Apex Court in Subramanian Swamy v. Raju 9 , in Karamjeet Singh v. Union of lndia 10 and Sulochana Devi v. District Magistrate 11.

AMIT ANILCHANDRA SHAH 425 learned counsel for Respondent 1 has further submitted that the decision in Sheonandan Paswan 7 is a minority view of the Bench and cannot be relied upon, and to fortify this contention he has relied upon the decision of the Delhi High Court in Peoples Union for Civil Liberties v. CB/ 12. 16. The learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 1 has submitted that Rubabbuddin had filed his affidavit stating that he did not want to proceed with the matter. He was given ample opportunity and after being satisfied that his request for withdrawal was voluntary, he was allowed to withdraw the application for condonation of delay. Under the circumstances, granting the relief as sought for in Prayer Clause (b) would tantamount to enquiring into the proceeding conducted by this Court, which is impermissible in law. The learned counsel for Respondent 1 has further stated that the High Court cannot invoke powers under Section 482 CrPC to direct a particular investigating agency to investigate a case or to follow a particular procedure. He has submitted that granting such relief as prayed for in Prayer Clause (b) would be contrary to the ratio of the Honourable Apex Court in State of Punjab v. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar 13. 17. The learned counsel for Respondent 1 has further submitted that the application lacks bona fides and is filed with ulterior motive and this is evident from the fact that though the alleged incident had occurred in the year 2005, the applicant has shown interest in the proceedings only in the year 2015 and that too after rejection of Criminal Application No. 420 of 2015 filed by one Rajesh Kamble in this very matter. Furthermore, several other accused have been discharged, but the applicant has targeted only Respondent 1, which fact clearly shows mala fides on the part of the applicant. 18. Mr Raju, the learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 1 has further submitted that the applicant was a member of the National Advisor Committee appointed by the rival political party, which fact has been concealed in the application , and the said fact coupled with the fact that the applicant has shown interest in the matter after a period of 10 years from the date of the alleged incident shows that the applicant lacks bona fides and that the application is politically motivated. 19. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor Shri Singh and Shri Shinde for CBI have also submitted that the applicant is not an aggrieved person and that Rubabbuddin, who was the aggrieved person was permitted to withdraw the revision application, and hence the present application is not maintainable.

I have perused the records and considered the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the respective parties. Respondent 1 was one of the accused in the aforestated sessions cases pending before the Sessions Court, Greater Bombay. The allegations against Respondent 1 in brief were that during the period 2004 to 2006 when he was the Minister of State (Home), State of Gujarat, he and some of the police officers of Gujarat and Rajasthan entered into a criminal conspiracy to nab and kill one Sohrabuddin. It is alleged that the said Sohrabuddin was killed on 26-11-2005 in a fake encounter at the instance of Respondent 1. Some days later, Kausarbi, the wife of Sohrabuddin, was also killed and her body was burnt and disposed of in a river near Village Illol. About a year later, on 27-12-2006, Tulsiram Prajapati was also allegedly killed in a fake encounter. 21. The anti-terrorism squad of Gujarat Police had registered a criminal case vide Crime No. 15 of 2005 against Sohrabuddin under Sections 120-B, 121, 121-A, 122,123,307,186,254 IPC read with Section 25(1) of the Arms Act. After investigation, a brief summary report was filed before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate at Ahmedabad. By order dated 1-2-2007 the said crime was closed as abated. 22. Rubabbuddin, the brother of Sohrabuddin had written a letter to the Honourable the Chief Justice of India to direct an enquiry in the matter of his brother's death and disappearance of his sister-in-law. The Honourable Supreme Court of India had directed the Director General of Police, Gujarat to inquire into the matter and pursuant to the directions, initially an enquiry was conducted and thereafter the CID (Crime), Gujarat investigated the crime and had filed a charge-sheet against 13 accused persons. Not being satisfied with the action, Rubabbuddin filed a writ petition before the Apex Court with a request to direct CBI to investigate the crime afresh. By order dated 12-1-2010 in Rubabbuddin Sheikh v. State of Gujarat 16 , the Honourable Supreme Court directed CBI to investigate into the matter and pursuant to the said directions, the CBI authorities took over the investigation. In the course of the investigation, CBI recorded statements of several witnesses. After completing the investigation, one main charge-sheet and 3 supplementary charge-sheets were filed before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mirzapur, Ahmedabad. By order dated 22-9-2012 the Honourable Supreme Court transferred the case to Mumbai. 23. Respondent 1 had filed a discharge application under Section 227 CrPC. The same came to be allowed by order dated 30-12-2014. CBI did not challenge the said order. Nonetheless, Rubabbuddin Shaikh, the brother of the deceased Sohrabuddin filed Criminal Revision Application No. 413 of 2015 16 (2010) 2 sec 200 : (2010) 2 sec (Cri) 1006 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Filing of the application dated 5-10-2005 by Rubabbuddin, seeking leave to withdraw the said revision application along with Criminal Application No. 355 of 2015 for condonation of delay has led to filing of the present application under Section 482 CrPC. 24. Relying upon the decision of the Apex Court in Dhariwa! 3 the learned Senior Counsel Shri Grover has submitted that availability of an alternative remedy of filing the revision application is not a bar for invoking jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC. It may be mentioned here that in Dhariwa! 3 the powers under Section 482 CrPC were invoked to challenge the summons issued under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act/Rules. The said application was not entertained in view of availability of alternative remedy of filing a revision application under Section 397 of the Code. While setting aside the said order, the Apex Court held that: (SCC p. 372, para 6) \"6. Indisputably, issuance of summons is not an interlocutory order within the meaning of Section 397 of the Code. This Court in a large number of decisions beginning fromR.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab 17 to Som Mittal v. State of Karnataka 18 has laid down the criterion for entertaining an application under Section 482. Only because a revision petition is maintainable, the same by itself, in our considered opinion, would not constitute a bar for entertaining an application under Section 482 of the Code.\" 25. Section 482 CrPC spells out the inherent powers of the High Court as under: \"482. Saving of inherent powers of High Court.-Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.\" 26. The scope of Section 482 vis-a-vis Section 397(2) of the Code has been elaborately explained by a three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court in Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra 2 as under: (SCC pp. 555 & 556, paras 8 & 10) \"8 . ... At the outset the following principles may be noticed in relation to the exercise of the inherent power of the High Court which have been followed ordinarily and generally, almost invariably, barring a few exceptions: '(1) That the power is not to be resorted to if there is a specific provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of the aggrieved party; 3 Dhariwal Tobacco Products Ltd. v.

On a plain reading of Section 482, however, it would follow that nothing in the Code, which would include sub-section (2) of Section 397 also , \"shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court\". But, if we were to say that the said bar is not to operate in the exercise of the inherent power at all, it will be setting at naught one of the limitations imposed upon the exercise of the revisional powers. In such a situation, what is the harmonious way out? In our opinion, a happy solution of this problem would be to say that the bar provided in sub-section (2) of Section 397 operates only in exercise of the revisional power of the High Court, meaning thereby that the High Court will have no power of revision in relation to any interlocutory order. Then in accordance with one of the other principles enunciated above, the inherent power will come into play, there being no other provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of the aggrieved party. But then, if the order assailed is purely of an interlocutory character which could be corrected in exercise of the revisional power of the High Court under the 1898 Code, the High Court will refuse to exercise its inherent power. But in case the impugned order clearly brings about a situation which is an abuse of the process of the court or for the purpose of securing the ends of justice interference by the High Court is absolutely necessary, then nothing contained in Section 397(2) can limit or affect the exercise of the inherent power by the High Court. But such cases would be few and far between. The High Court must exercise the inherent power very sparingly. One such case would be the desirability of the quashing of a criminal proceeding initiated illegally, vexatiously or as being without jurisdiction.\" 27. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab 19 the question before the Apex Court was whether the inherent power of the High Court could be invoked for quashing the criminal proceedings against an offender who had settled the dispute with the victim; in respect of the crime which was not compoundable under Section 320 of the Code. A three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court after analysing the previous decisions has reiterated as under: (SCC pp. 339-40, paras 53-56) \"53. Section 482 of the Code, as its very language suggests, saves the inherent power of the High Court which it has by virtue of it being a superior court to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. It begins with the words, \"nothing in this Code\" which means that the provision is an overriding provision. These words leave no manner of doubt that none of the provisions of the Code limits 19 (2012) 10sec 303 : (2012)4SCC (Ci v) 1188: (2013) 1 sec (Cri) 160 : (2012)2SCC (L&S) 988 b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The guideline for exercise of such power is provided in Section 482 itself i.e. to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. As has been repeatedly stated that Section 482 confers no new powers on the High Court; it merely safeguards existing inherent powers possessed by the High Court necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. It is equally well settled that the power is not to be resorted to if there is specific provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of an aggrieved party. It should be exercised very sparingly and it should not be exercised as against the express bar of law engrafted in any other provision of the Code. 54. In different situations, the inherent power may be exercised in different ways to achieve its ultimate objective. Formation of opinion by the High Court before it exercises inherent power under Section 482 on either of the twin objectives, (i) to prevent abuse of the process of any court, or (ii) to secure the ends of justice, is a sine qua non. 55. In the very nature of its constitution, it is the judicial obligation of the High Court to undo a wrong in course of administration of justice or to prevent continuation of unnecessary judicial process. This is founded on the legal maxim quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, conceditur et id sine qua res ipsa esse non potest. The full import of which is whenever anything is authorised, and especially if, as a matter of duty, required to be done by law, it is found impossible to do that thing unless something else not authorised in express terms be also done, may also be done, then that something else will be supplied by necessary intendment. Ex debito justitiae is inbuilt in such exercise; the whole idea is to do real, complete and substantial justice for which it exists. The power possessed by the High Court under Section 482 of the Code is of wide amplitude but requires exercise with great caution and circumspection. 56. It needs no emphasis that exercise of inherent power by the High Court would entirely depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. It is neither permissible nor proper for the court to provide a straitjacket formula regulating the exercise of inherent powers under Section 482. No precise and inflexible guidelines can also be provided.\" 28. In Mohit v. State of U.P.8 while considering the question whether the application under Section 482 CrPC challenging the order of the Sessions Court passed under Section 319 CrPC was maintainable, the Apex Court has held as under: (SCC p. 806, para 28) \"28. So far as the inherent power of the High Court as contained in Section 482 CrPC is concerned, the law in this regard is set at rest by this Court in a catena of decisions. However, we would like to reiterate that when an order, not interlocutory in nature, can be assailed in the High Court in revisional jurisdiction, then there should be a bar in invoking the inherent s (2013) 7 sec 789 : (2013) 3 sec (Cri) 727 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In other words, inherent power of the Court can be exercised when there is no remedy provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure for redressal of the grievance. It is well settled that the inherent power of the Court can ordinarily be exercised when there is no express provision in the Code under which order impugned can be challenged.\" 29. In the instant case, the applicant has invoked the power under Section 482 CrPC to challenge the order of discharge dated 30-12-2014 whereby the learned Sessions Judge, Greater Bombay has discharged Respondent 1 of the offences under Sections 120-B, 364, 365, 368, 341, 342, 384,302,218 read with Section 201 IPC. It is not in dispute that the said order is not an interlocutory order and could be challenged by invoking the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Sections 397 /401 CrPC. Hence, in the light of the law laid down by a three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court in M adhu Limaye 2 and which has been followed in Gian Singh 19 and Mohit 8, the powers under Section 482 cannot be resorted to in view of the said specific provision of the Code for the redressal of the grievance particularly when the aggrieved party had already assailed the said order in revisional jurisdiction of this Court. 30. The applicant had sought to invoke the power under Section 482 CrPC mainly on the ground that Respondent 1 through powerful network of forces at his command has prevailed upon Rubabbuddin Shaikh to withdraw the revision application. The applicant has alleged that the withdrawal appears to be suspicious, under threat, inducement and promise. 31. It is no doubt true that the powers under Sections 482 and 483 CrPC are wide. However, it is well settled that these powers should be exercised sparingly to prevent abuse of process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice or to prevent misuse of judicial mechanism or miscarriage of justice. In the instant case, Rubabbuddin, the brother of the deceased who is an aggrieved party and at whose instance the crime was registered had by application dated 5-10-2015 which was supported by his affidavit, sought leave to withdraw the revision application as well as the application for condonation of delay. Since the said Rubabbuddin was not represented by an advocate, no order was passed on the said application on the said date. On 6-10-2015 the said Rubabbuddin had remained present along with his counsel and had once again sought leave to withdraw the said applications. The counsel for Rubabbuddin had also stated that Rubabbuddin had expressed his desire to withdraw the revision application. Rubabbuddin who was present in the court, upon being questioned, had reiterated that he was seeking to withdraw the application voluntarily and that he was not under pressure, threat or coercion from any person to withdraw the said applications. Despite the said statement, no order was passed on the withdrawal application as it was felt necessary to 2 Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra, (1977) 4 SCC 551 : 1978 SCC (Cri) 10 19 Gian Singh v.

Once again on 20-10-2015 Rubabbuddin r emained present before the court along with his counsel and reiterated his desire to withdraw the said applications. He was heard in person in the chamber to ascertain whether his decision to withdraw the application was voluntary. Since said Rubabbuddin did not appear to be in a physically fit condition, further time of one month was granted. The records reveal that on 23-11-2015 the said Rubabbuddin had remained present before the court and had once again reiterated his request to withdraw the application for condonation of delay. He had also made a statement that he did not want to file any application in future in respect of the subject-matter of the revision application. In view of the said statement made by Rubabbuddin, this Court (Coram: A.V. Nirgude, J.) allowed the withdrawal of the application for condonation of delay and consequently, dispos e d of th e revision application. 32. The records thus reveal that Rubabbuddin, the aggrieved person had challenged the order of discharge dated 30-10-2014 by filing the revision application along with the application for condonation of delay. He had therefore, filed an application to withdraw the said revision application for condonation of delay. The aggrieved person was allowed to withdraw the application after giving him ample opportunities to reconsider his request and after being satisfied that the request was voluntary. Consequently, there is no merit in the grounds raised by the applicant to invoke the inherent power of the Court. 33. Now , coming to the question of locus standi of the applicant, it is well settled that anyone can set the criminal law in motion. In A.R. Antu lay v. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak 5 the Apex Court has held thus: (SCC p. 508, para 6) \"6. It is a well-recognised principle of criminal jurisprudence that anyone can set or put the criminal law into motion except where the statute enacting or creating an offence indicates to the contrary. The scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure envisages two parallel and independent agenci es for taking criminal offences to court. Even for the most serious offence of murder, it was not disputed that a private complaint can , not only be filed but can be entertained and proceeded with according to law. Locus standi of the complainant is a concept foreign to criminal jurisprudence save and except that where the statute creating an offence provides for the eligibility of the complainant, by necessary implication the general principle gets excluded by such statutory provision.\" 34. These principles have been reiterated in Subramanian Swamy 6 in the following words: (SCC p. 101, para 72) \"72.

The right of access, a constitutional right should not be burdened with unreasonable fetters. When a private citizen approaches a court of law against a corrupt public servant who is highly placed, what is at stake is not only a vindication of personal grievance of that citizen but also the question of bringing orderliness in society and maintaining equal balance in the Rule of Law.\" 35. In Sheonandan Paswan 7 the main controversy was whether the prosecution launched against Dr Jagannath Mishra is rightly allowed to be withdrawn, or whether the withdrawal was invalid. The minority view, expressed by Bhagwati, J. on the question of locus standi in respect of interpretation and scope of Section 321 was as under: (SCC p. 316, para 14) \"14 . ... Now if any citizen can lodge a first information report or file a complaint and set the machinery of criminal law in motion and his locus standi to do so cannot be questioned, we do not see why a citizen who finds that a prosecution for an offence against the society is wrongly withdrawn, cannot oppose such withdrawal. If he can be a complainant or initiator of criminal prosecution, he should be equally entitled to oppose withdrawal of the criminal prosecution which has already been initiated at his instance. If the offence for which a prosecution is being launched is an offence against the society and not merely and individual wrong, any member of the society must have locus to initiate a prosecution as also to resist withdrawal of such prosecution, if initiated.\" 36. The present case does not involve the issue of locus standi of a third party/stranger for setting the criminal law in motion. The issue in the present case is whether the applicant, who is a total stranger to the proceedings can invoke the powers under Section 482 CrPC to challenge the discharge order. Hence, the decision in Antulay 5 is not strictly applicable to the facts of the present case. 37. The observations in Sheonandan Paswan 7 on the question of locus standi were restricted to the interpretation and scope of Section 321 CrPC. The judgment does not lay down that a stranger to the proceeding can invoke the inherent powers of the court under Section 482 CrPC for challenging the order of discharge particularly when the order of discharge is revisable. 38. At this stage it would be advantageous to refer to the decision of the Apex Court in Subramanian Swamy 9 wherein the petitioner, in a public interest litigation had sought an authoritative pronouncement of the true purport and effect of the different provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act so as to take a juvenile out of the purview of the said Act. The High Court had declined to answer the question raised on the ground that the petitioners had an alternative 7 Sheonandan Paswan v. State of Bihar, (1987) 1 SCC 288: 1987 SCC (Cri) 82 5 A.R.

In the SLP filed before the Apex Court, an objection was raised as regards its maintainability on the ground that it suffers from the vice of absence of locus on the part of the petitioner. While considering this objection the Apex Court has observed thus: (SCC p. 469, para 8) \"8. The administration of criminal justice in India can be divided into two broad stages at which the machinery operates. The first is the investigation of an alleged offence leading to prosecution and the second is the actual prosecution of the offender in a court of law. The jurisprudence that has evolved over the decades has assigned the primary role and responsibility at both stages to the State though we must hasten to add that in certain exceptional situations there is a recognition of a limited right in a victim or his family members to take part in the process, particularly, at the stage of the trial. The law, however, frowns upon and prohibits any abdication by the State of its role in the matter at each of the stages and, in fact, does not recognise the right of a third party/stranger to participate or even to come to the aid of the State at any of the stages.\" 39. On merits the SLP was held to be maintainable as the adjudication that the petitioner was seeking had implications beyond the case/proceedings. It was held that the interpretations of the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act would have effect on all juveniles, who may come in conflict with law-both in the immediate and near future. 40. In Simranjit Singh Mann 20 and Karamjeet Singh 10 while considering the question whether a third party who is a total stranger to the prosecution culminating in the conviction of the accused has any locus standi to challenge the conviction and sentence awarded to them, by invoking Article 32 of the Constitution, the Apex Court has reiterated that neither the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 nor any other statute permits a third party/ stranger to question the correctness of conviction and sentence imposed by the court after the regular trial. 41. In Sulochana Devi 11 the petitioner who was not a party to the proceedings had invoked the powers of the High Court under Section 482 CrPC to challenge the order of issuance of proclamation under Section 82 of the Code and attachment of the property. Raising the issue of locus standi, preliminary objection was raised to the maintainability of the application at the behest of the petitioner. The Orissa High Court after considering the scope of Section 482 CrPC as well as the decisions of the Apex Court in Madhu Limaye 2 , Simranjit Singh 20 and in Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary 21 held that: 20 Simranjit Singh Mann v. Union of India, (1992) 4 SCC 653 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 22 10 Karamjeet Singh v.

Ordinarily, the aggrieved party, which is affected by any order has the right to seek redress by questioning the legality, validity or correctness of the order unless such party is a minor and insane person or is suffering from any other disability which law recognises as sufficient to permit another person e.g. next friend, to move the court in his behalf.\" 42. Reverting to the case in hand, it is not in dispute that the applicant is neither a victim nor an aggrieved person. He is not in any manner connected with the proceedings pending before the learned Sessions Court, Greater Bombay. The applicant has not suffered any prejudice and has not demonstrated that his legal rights are impaired or any harm/injury is caused to him or is likely to be caused. The applicant has thus not been able to demonstrate that his legal right has been invaded so as to give him locus standi to challenge the order. 43. The applicant who claims to be a socially responsible citizen has allegedly filed thi s application for preventing abuse of process of court. It is pertinent to note that though the alleged incident had occurred in the year 2005, and no case was registered against Respondent 1 and the other police officers, the applicant herein had not shown any interest to set the criminal law in motion. The said crime was registered only pursuant to the directions given by the Honourable Supreme Court in view of the letter of grievance made by Rubabbuddin, the brother of the deceased. 44. It is also pertinent to note that Respondent 1 was discharged by the order dated 30-12-2014. CBI had not challenged the said order. The aggrieved person, Rubabbuddin had also not filed any revision application within the period of limitation. Despite which the applicant, who claims to be a socially responsible citizen, had not taken any steps to challenge the said order. It is to be noted that one Shri Rajesh Kamble, who was also not a party to the proceedings, had opposed the withdrawal application filed by Rubabbuddin Shaikh in his capacity of being \"an alert citizen\". The said application was dismissed vide order dated 21-10-2015. The applicant has shown interest in this matter only after the dismissal of the application filed by Rajesh Kamble. 45. It is also pertinent to note that several other accused in the said crime have also been discharged, but the applicant has not challenged the said orders, but has sought to challenge only the order whereby the present Respondent 1 has been discharged. The social interest and responsibility proclaimed by the applicant is thus restricted only to the relief sought against Respondent 1 and does not even extend to other accused in the said case much less having larger implications beyond the case.
