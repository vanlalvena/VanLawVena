We think it unfair to drive parties to a new litigation of unknown duration but direct, in the special circumstances of the case ( which are peculiar) that : (a) the revision before the High Court shall stand dismissed ; (b) the Rent Controller will take note of the subsequent development disabling the landlord from seeking eviction on which there is already an adverse finding by the High Court ; ( c) the landlord be allowed to amend his petition if he has a case for eviction on any other legally permissible ground ; and ( d) the parties be given fair and full opportunity to file additional pleadings and lead evidence thereon. But we make it clear that the subsequent event that the petitioner had come by a non-residential accommodation of his own in the same town having been found by the High Court, cannot be canvassed over again. That finding of legal disability cannot be reopened. We keep open for enquiry only grounds, if any, which may reasonably be permitted by amendment if they are of any relevance or use for eviction. 7. With these observations we partially allow the appeal as indicated above and direct the parties to bear their respective costs. (1975) 1 Supreme Court Ca■e• 774 (Before A. N. Ray, C.J. and K. K.

Held: Per Ray, C.J. and Mathew, J. (Krishna Iyer, J. concurring) The effect of allowing an application for review of a decree is to vacate the decree passed. The decree that is subsequently passed on review, whether it modifies, reverses or confirms the decree originally passed, is a new decree superseding the original one.

The respondent State did not file any appeal from the decree dated August 18, 1961 awarding compensation for the land acquired at the rate of Rs. 200 per katba. On the other hand, it sought for a review of that decree and succeeded in getting the decree vacated. When it filed appeal No. 81 of 1962, before the High Court, it could not have filed an appeal aga1DSt the decree dated August 18, 1961 passed by the Additional District Judge as at that time that decree bad already been superseded by the decree dated September 26, 1961 passed after review. So the appeal filed by the respondent before the High Court could only be an appeal against the decree passed after review. When the High Court came to the con- clusion that the Additional District Judge went wrong in allowing the review, it should have allowed the cross appeal. Since no appeal was preferred by the respondent against the decree passed on August 18, 1961 awarding compensation for the land at the rate of Rs. 200 per katha, that decree became final. The respondent made no attempt to file an appeal against that decree when the High Court found that the review was wrongly allowed on the basis that the decree revived and came into life again. (Para 3) Hence the High Court should have allowed the cross appeal, and dismissed the appeal, which was, and could only be against the decree passed on September 26, 1961 after the review. The result is that the decree of August 18, 1961 is restored. (Para 4) Appeal allowed M/2434/C Advocat,s who app,artd in this cas, : P. K.

(for himself and Ray, C.J.)-The appellant was the owner of 3 · 30 acres - roughly equal to 7 bighas, 17 kathas and 14 dhurs - of land. The land was acquired under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act.

The total compensation including the value of trees and other improvements came to Rs. 6,775 · 22 p. The appellant was dis- satisfied with the award. He filed an application before the Land Acquisition Collector for referring the matter to the District Court under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act claiming compensation for the lands at the rate of Rs . 500 per katha. The case was referred and the Additional District Judge, Purnea by his judgment dated August 18, 1961 found that the appellant was entitled to compensation for the land acquired at the rate of Rs. 200 per katha and also made certain other modifications in the amount of compensation under the other heads.

The learned Additional District Judge allowed the application for review and passed fresh judgment on September 26, 1961 reducing the compen- sation for land from Rs . 200 to Rs . 7 5 per katha. Thereafter the res- pondent filed Appeal No. 81 of 1962 in the •High Court of Patna. The Memorandum of Appeal stated that the appeal was being preferred against the decrees dated August 18, 1961/September 26, 1961, but the grounds taken in the Memorandum of Appeal as well as the court fee paid would show that the appeal was only against the decree dated September 26, 1961 awarding compensation at the rate of Rs. 7 5 per katha and not against the decree dated August 18, 1961 awarding compensation at the rate of Rs. 200 per katha. The appellant filed a cross appeal challenging the maintainability of the review petition filed by the respondent before the Additional District Judge as also the order passed thereon by him allowing the petition and vacating the decree dated August 18, 19 61. The appeal and the cross appeal were disposed of by the judgment of the High Court dated February 16, 1968. The High Court found that the Additional District Judge went wrong in entertaining the review and vacating the judgment and decree dated August 18, 1961 but, never- theless, it considered the appeal filed by the respondent on merits and dismissed the appeal and cross appeal thereby maintaining the compen- sation awarded for the land at the rate of Rs. 7 5 per katha by the judgment and decree dated September 26, 1961 of the Additional District Judge. This appeal, on the basis of a certificate, is directed against the decree of the High Court. 2. It is well settled that the effect of allowing an application for review of a decree is to vacate the decree passed. The decree that is subsequently passed on review, whether it modifies, reverses or confirms the decree originally passed, is a new decree superseding the original one (see Nibaran Chandra Sikdar v. Abdul Hakim1, Kanhaiya Lal v. Baldeo Prasad', Brijbasi Lal v. Salig Ram 3 and Pyari Mohan Kundu v. Kalu Khan•). 3. The respondent did not file any appeal from the decree dated August 18, 1961 awarding compensation for the land acquired at the rate of Rs. 200 per katha. On the other hand, it sought for a review of that decree and succeeded in getting the decree vacated. When it filed Appeal No. 81 of 1962, before the High Court, it could not have filed an appeal against the decree dated August 18, 1961 passed by the Additional District Judge as at that time that decree had already been suptrseded by the decree dated September 26, 1961 passed after review. So the appeal filed . by the respondent before the High Court could only be an appeal agwnst the decree passed after review. When I. AIR 1928 Cal 418. 2. lLR (1906) 28 All 240, 3.

The High Court should have allowed the cross appeal; and dismissed the appeal, which was, and could only be against the decree passed on September 26, 1961, after the review. We therefore set aside the judgment and decree passed by the High Court and allow the appeal.

(concurring)-! concur regretfully with the result reached by the infallible logic of the law set out by my learned brother Mathew, J. The mortality of justice at the hands of law troubles a Judge's conscience and points an angry interrogation at the- law reformer. 6. The processual law so dominates in certain systems as to over- power substantive rights and substantial justice. The humanist rule that procedure should be the handmaid, not the mistress, of legal justice compels consideration of vesting a residuary power in judges to act ex debito justiciae where the tragic sequel otherwise would be wholly inequitable. In the present case, almost every step a reasonable litigant could take was taken by the State to challenge the extraordinary increase in the rate of compensation awarded by the civil court. And, by hindsight, one finds that the very success, in the review application, and at the appellate stage has proved a disaster to the party. Maybe. Government might have successfully attacked the increase awarded in appeal, producing the additional evidence there. But maybes have no place in the merciless consequence of vital procedural flaws. Parliament, I hope, will consider the wisdom of making the Judge the ultimate guardian of justice by a comprehensive, though guardedly worded, provision where the hindrance to rightful relief relates to infirmities, even serious, sounding in procedural law. Justice is the goal of jurisprudence - processual, as much as substantive. While this appeal has to be allowed, for reasons set out impeccably by my learned brother, I must soun~ a pessimistic note that it is too puritanical for a legal system to sacnfice the end product of equity and good conscience at the altar of processual punctiliousness and it is not too radical to avert a breakdown of obvious justice by bending sharply, if need be, the prescriptions of procedure. The wages of pro- cedural sin should never be the death of rights.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
