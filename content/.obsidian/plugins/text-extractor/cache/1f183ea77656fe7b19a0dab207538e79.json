The Chief Justice, who heard the case, should be regarded as disqualified by reason of his interest, and he acted very really as judge in his own cause. In any · event, the local correspondent who, admittedly, did no more than send a report to a newspaper which could, and in fact did, exercise its own discretion whether it would publish it with or without first editing it, cannot be held guilty of contempt of court. The whole conduct of the proceedings, even if there is no technical disqualification for interest, was such, having regard to the personality imrolved, that the conviction ought not to be allowed to stand, for the Chief Justice was the only victim of the criticisms, he directed that the prosecution should take place, he sat as a judge at every stage of the prosecution, he was a witness as to the most vital facts in the case, he examined a witness without notice to the appellants and brought the witness into court ._llnd then examined him, he adjudicated on an acute contest of fact which made a considerable difference to the hearing, he sentenced the appellants, and then refused a stay of execution. On the question whether the words complained of are capable of being a contempt of court In re -a Special Reference from th~ Bahama Islands ( 1) is of some assistance. Tn McLeod v. #St. Aubyn (2) it was said that committal for contempt of court is a weapon to be used sparingly, and always with reference to the interests of the administration of justice. [Reference was also made to Reg. v. Gray (3) and Ambard v. Attorney-General for Trinidad and Tobago ( 4)] . . Here the criticism was not in relation to the administration of justice. Where criticism does not contain abuse, the mere f_act that there is some inaccuracy in relation to the facts is not enough to justify a finding of contempt of court. Even if the news item here was untrue, the article on it was not contempt of court. On the question of the disqualification of the Chief Justice for interest, there are two propositions : first , that he was -oisqualified from trying this case by the fact that he was interested in it ; and secondly, by _reason of all the circum- stances of the trial, and in particular the many roles played by the Chief Justice, there was never the substance of a £air trial. fHe ,ms stopped, the Board intimating that they would hear (1) [18931 A.C. 138.

The authorities show, at any rate, that ,,·hat amounts to contempt of court is something said or written which lowers the authority of the court in the sense- of the dignity and position to which a court as a oourt adminis- tering justice is entitled. The contrast is between language which lowers the dignity of the court in that sense and language which · can be justified on proved facts as criticism in the public interest. Language which is calculated to lower the dignity of the court is prirna facie - centempt of court. Rex v. Davi,es ( 1). Bearing that principle in mind and turning to the_ present case, it is a very disparaging thing to say that a Chief Justice has enjoined such conduct as is alleged ; it is a reflection on him qua judge, and amounts to a contempt of court in that it lowers the authority of the court and · disparages the administration of justice. Thl' Chief Justice's critici.c;m that it was unworthy of him is correct. With regard to the \"if.\" the opening word of the comment, if the fair inference from the language of the comment is to make the insinuation I have asserted, then the mere fact tha.t it is preceded by a conditional clause is nQt enough to prevent it being given that effect when in fact the appellants made no inquiry to find out if it was true. This case has to be fought on the assumption that the findings of fact of the Chief Justice are to . be accepted, and from the outset it was assumed by atl concerned that no circular had been issued by the Chief Justice and no instructions given of the kind alleged or at all : the Chief Justice also reached the conclusion that Mr. Vidyarthi di<l not say so.

Their Lordships, for reasons which will appear, do not find jt necessary to enumerate the facts · alleged in ~'tr. Gandhi's affidavit. ·In '\"ubstance, they were that Mr. Singhal had been present in the court of Mr. Vidyarthi on July 31 when he gave judgment in the murder case, and that after sentencing the four accused to transportation for life t-he judge made the following statement in open court : \"Since \" _the Chief Justice, who has been requested by His Excellency \" the Governor to help in the wa.r effort, has asked us to raise · · subscriptions for the war fund, it is incumbent on us to rais<' ' ' subscriptions and you should help me in this work.\" There- upon, lawyers and litigants present in court held consultations ; Rs.200 were collected jn court and placed on the table of the judge : and, according to Mr. Singhal, one of the counsel who appeared for some of the aocused told the court that he had C'ollec>ted Rs.150 from his clients as requested by the judge and that ht' would present that money the next morning·. The judge then declared the rest of the accused discharged. This statement was said · to have been corroborated by various people in Meerut, some present at the trial and some not. At t-he hearing on SeptC'ml:x-r 9 nn further evidence was tendered. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, rnunsel for the printer ancl the editor, repeated that it was no part of the intention of either t.o cast any reflection on the court. The Chief Justic~ stated that the information '\"'Ont.ained in the comment was based on untrue fa<>ts, and that no circular was issued by him, and he would like further discussion to proceed on that basis. This statement · was accepted by counsel, and the case has proce6Cled on the footing that no <>irndar ancl no request was issued by the Chief Justfoe to judicial officers of the subordinate courts to the effect stated.

The Chief Justice, before the day, reserved for judgment arrived, had with Collister J. interviewed Mt. Vidyarthi and gave notice to the appellants on September 11 that as he had asserted that most of the allegations in Mr. Gandhi 's affidavit were untrue, the court proposed to examine him and another witness in court on September 15, and that the appellants would be given the opportunity of calling further evidence. The two . witnesses were examined, the case was further adjourned to September 25, the Chief Justice stating that in a way Mr. Vidyarthi was also on trial, and would be allowed to produce witnesses. At the resumed hearing the Chief Justice said that if Mr. Vidyarthi did not utter the words alleged then Mr. Singhal would primarily be guilty of contempt of court, having sent the information, and that it was desirable that the proceedings should continue together. Accordingly, it was agreed by Mr. Singhal and all the parties that Mr. Singhal should accept a notice then issued that he should \" show cause why he should not be dealt with for \" contempt of this court with respect to the news published \"in the Hindustan Times of Sunday, August 3, on information \"supplied by him.\" The case proceeded on this footing on ~cptember 26 and 27 and October 27 and 28, when Mi.

The \"implication is that the Chief Justice h~d done something \" which was unworthy of a person holding that high office, ·· anJ that as the head and representative of this High Court \"he had committed the gross impropriety of forcing judicial \" officers subordinate to this court to ask for war contributions \"from litigants who, notwithstanding that the giving of \" donations was ostensibly voluntary, were not in a position \" to refuse.\" As to Mr. Singal, the court found that he sent information which was probably founded either on his own inference from what took place or on a suggestion from .other persons, and he had endeavoured to defend his action by giving evidence which they were unable to accept as true. A~ to the printer and Mr. Gandhi, they had no reason to suspect the accuracy of their correspondent's reports and were acquitted of malice. Nevertheless, they erred grievously in publishing the news item and the editorial comment without attempting to verify its truth. At the hearing of the appeal their Lordships intimated that they desire<l to deal first with the primary question whether in the circumstances the words complained of were capable of being a c0ntempt of court, and counsel for both sides argued this point. On the conclusion of this argument their Lordships initimated that their decision was in favour of the appellants. The other points, therefore, raised by the appellants were not further discussed by counsel for the appellants or at all by counsel for the respondent, and their Lordships must not be taken as expressing any opinion one -way or the other on them. In their Lordships' opinion, the eonviction for contempt of court cannot stand. The cases of contempt which consist of \" scandalizing the court itself\" are fortunately rare, and require to be treated with much rliscretion.

In In re a Special Reference from the Bahama Islands (2) the test applied by the very strong Board which heard the reference was whether the words complained of were in the circumstances calculated to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice and the due administration of the law. In Reg. v. Gray (3) it was shown that the offence of scandalizing the court itself was not obsolete in this country. A very scandalous attack had been made on a judge for his judicial utterances while sitting in a criminal case on circuit, and it was with the fore- · g-oing opinions on record that Lord Russell nf Killowen C.J., adopting the expression of Wilmot C.J. in his opinion in Rex v. Almon ( 4), which is the source of mnch of the present law on the ~-ubject, spoke of the article complained of as calculated to lower the authority of the judge. When the comment in questi0n in the present case is examined it is found that there is no criticism of any judicial act of the Chief Justice, or any imputation on him for anything done or omitted to be done by him in the administrntion of justice. Tt can hardly be said that there is any criticism of him in hi:-- administrative capacity, for, as far as their Lordships have been infornw<i. · the administrative control of the :-,ubordinate courts of the J-'rovinc-e, whatever it is, is exercised, not hy the Chief Justice, but by the court over which he presides.

Tn truth, the Chief Justice is alleged. untruly, as is now a<lmitted, to have committed an ill-advised act in writing to his subordinate judges asking ( as the news item says), enjoining ( as the comment says) them to colle<'t for the War Fund. Tf - the facts were as alkged they aJmitted of eriticism. No doubt it is galling for any judicial personage to be criticized publicly as having done something outside his judicial pro- c>eroings which was ill-advised or indisneet. But judicial personages ean afford not to be too sensitive. A simple denial in public of the alleged request would at once have allay(l<l the trouble.
