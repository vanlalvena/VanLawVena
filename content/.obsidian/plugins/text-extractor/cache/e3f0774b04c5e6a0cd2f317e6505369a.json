The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH, J .-The first appellant-Sekander Sheikh-was charged iµ a trial held before the Additional Sessions Judge, Murshidabad, in the State of West Bengal, for the offences of forging a valuable security punishable under s. 467 I. P. Code and of falsely personating another in such ~ssumed charac- ter and presenting · a document for registration punishable under s. 82 {c) of Indian Registration Act.

Stalt of l'f1Jt B1•1gal 51Nh, J. 854 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] VOL. and abetment thereof was held by the Sessions Judge sitting with a jury and for the offence• under the Registration Act without a Jury. The jury brought in a verdict of guilty by a majority of 4 to 3 against the appellants fur the offences of forging a valuable security and 'abetmcnt thereof, but the Judge did not accept the verdict and made a reference under s. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure· to the High Court of Calcutta, because in his view there was 'absolutely no reliable evidence' against the two appellants in respect of the offence of forging a valuable security and that it was in the interests of justice to refer the case to the High Court. The Sessions Judge acquitced the two appellants of offences under the Indian Registration Act. The High Court declined to accept the reference and convicted the two appellants respectively of the oil'ences punishable under s. •!Iii and s. -167 read with s. Jt)!J of the Indian Penal Code, and sentenced each appellant to suffer rigorous imprisonment for two years. \\\\'ith certificate of fitness granted by the High Court under Art. 134 (I) (c) the appellants have appealed to this Court. The charges against the first appellant were- (i) that on or about .January 15, I 9i>8, he had in the town of Bcrhampore forged a Iieba- nama in respect of certain property in favour of one Ali Hossain purporting to execute the same in the name of one Kaimuddin of Debkundu and that the execution of the document was made with intent to cause the said Kaimuddin to part with his property and to commit fraud ; and (ii) that on the same day he had falsely per- sonated Kaimuddin Sheikh and in that aasumed character had presented for 1 S.C.R. SUPREMt COURT REPORTS 8.i5 registration the H eba -namr~ in the Berhampore sub-reg!stry and h •d affixed his thumb 1mpress10ns claiming to be Kaimuddin Sheikh. The second appellant was charged with abetting the first appellant in the commission of the two offences by identifying the first appellant as Kaimu- dclin Sheikh. At the trial the prosecution examined one Swarana Kumar Dey who testified that he had engrossed the Heba-nnma in favour of Ali Hossain which was executed by the fir>t appellant purporting to do so as Kaimuddin Sheikh, that the first appellant had impressed his thumb mark on the document before him in token of execution of the lleba-nama that the first appellant had represented himself to be Kaimuddin Sheikh, and that the executant of the document was identified before him as Kaimuddin Sheikh by the second appellant Hasibuddin Sheikh. Kaimuddin Sheikh testified that he had not executed any Heba-nrimr1 in favour of Ali Hossain and that he had not impressed his thumb-mark on any docu- ment in the presence of Swarana Kumar Dey. A certified copy of the Jleba-nrtma was shown to the witness and he denied having executed and presented the original thereof before the Sub-Registrar. Evi- dence was also tendered that the thumb impressions of the two appellants were taken by the investigating officer in the presence of a Magistrate and those ~pecimen thumb impressions were compared with the thumb impressions in the register at the sub- registry at Berhampore by a hand-writing expert and that the thumb impressions of the first appellant talli- ed with the thumb impressions in the said register and not with the thumb impressions of Kaimuddin Sheikh. In the view of the High Court, this evidence was sufficient to establish against the two appellants the offences of forging a valuable security and abetment thereof. 1961 Se!undar Si:ei!.:1~ v. State of West B1ngaj Shali, J, 1963 Stktnd'\" ~W4 v. Slatt of Wul Btntal S/iah, J, 856 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] VOL. It is now well settled that in a reference under s. 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if 1he evidence is such that it can properly support a verdict of guilty or not guilty, according to the view taken of the evidence by the trial Court, and if the jury take one view of the evidence and the Judge is of the opinion that they should have taken the other, the view of the jury must prevail. for they are the judges of fact. In such a case a reference under s. 307 of the Cocle of Criminal Procedure is not justified. But if the High Couri holds that upon the evidence no reasonable body of men could have reached the con· clusion arrived at by the jury, the reference will be justified and the verdict of the jury will be dis- regarded : Rm1wnugrah Sinr;h v. KinlJ Emperor('). It appears that the Court of Session was not impressed by the testimony of Swarana Kumar Dey but it was for the jury to assess the value of the evidence. The jury had apparently accepted the evidence of Swarana Kumar Dey and of Kaimuddin Sheikh, and it could not be said that no reasonable body of men could have accepted that evidence. At the trial, evidence about the specimen thumb impres>ions of the appellants laken during 1he course of the investigation were relied upon in support of the prosecution case. This court has held that there is no infringement of Ari. 20(3) of the Constitution merely by tendering evidence of this character, in support of the case for the proseculion against a person accused of an offence: The State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu. Oghad ('). The Court in that case set out certain propositions of which the follow- ing arc material- \"(ii) the words. 'to be a witness' in Art. 20(3) do not include the giving of thumb impression or impression of Palm, foot or fingers or speci- men writing or exposing a part of the body by an accused person for identification; (I) (1946) L.R, 73 I.A, 17+.

It was submitted that as the offences under s. 467 LP. Code ands. 82 (c) Indian Registration Act formed part of the same transaction and the case for the prosecution for t_he former offence was substantially founded on the same evidence which ·was not accepted by the trial Court when acquitting the appellants of the 1969 S1kenda' Sheikh v State oj Wert Bengal Shah, J. 1963 Stlct1ul·1r SJ.1ikh y, ·'Iott of H t1l Ba1:;al Shah, J. 858 SUPREt.lE COURT REPORTS (I!Ju4] VOL. latter offence, the High Court could not act upon that evidence to r~cord an order of conviction on the charge for the offence of forging a valuable security. We arc unable to accept this argument. Forging a valuable security and presentation of that valuable security for registration are two distinct offences. In support of the case that the appellants were guilty of forging a valuable security the material evidence is that relating to the making dishonestly or fraudulently of a false document of the nature of a valuable security. That evidence consisted of the instructions given at the time of writing of the document, the character of the document, its execution, and the intention of the accust>d in fabricating the document. The offence of false personation for presenting any document consisted in the presentation of a document before the registering authority by a person claiming to be some one else. An item of evidence may corroborate charges for more offences than one : but acquittal of the accused for one such offences will not render that item of evidence inadmissible in assessing the criminality of the accused for another offence corroborated thereby. The question in such a case is not one of admissibility but of weight to be given to that e\\'idence. The decision of the .Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Ma:ak Klmn v. King Emperor ('), negatives the submission of the appellants. In 1}/a/rJk Khan'.~ case the accused was charged before the Court of Session for offences of murder and robbery. He was acquitted by the Trial Judge of the offence of robbery and convicted of the offence of murder. The Hi~h Court in appeal against the order of conviction relied upon the evidence which was material to both the charges of robbery and murder, as corroborative of the guilt of the accused for the offence of murder. It was held by the Judicial Committee that the High Court could properly accept the evidence as corroborative of the guilt of the accused for the offence of murder, even though that evidence was not accepted by the tlial (I) (19f5) L.R, 72 I.A. 305. \" 1 S.C.It. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 859 Court on the charge of robbery. la considering the argument that the evidence could not be relied upon in support of the charge of murder, the Judicial Committee observed : \"The Sessions Judge, it was said, had acquitted the appellant of robbery; he was, therefore, not guilty of that offence; no appeal had been taken against that acquittal and therefore no Court was entitled to take into consideration the allegation upon which the accusation of robbery was founded even as corroborative \"evidence\" in another case. Their Lordships cannot accept this contention. The learned Sessions Judge did not in fact find the accusation baseless ; he only found the crime not pro\\'en. But even if he had disbelieved the whole story of the recovery of the stolen property from the appellant, his finding would not prevent the High Court from weighing its value and if they accepted its substantial truth from taking it into consideration in determining whether another crime had been committed or no.\" The High Court was therefore not debarred from founding the order of conviction for the offences under s. 467 l.P. Code and abetment thereof, of the appellants upon evidence, which corroborated the story of the prosecution in support of those charges merely because that evidence was not accepted by the Sessions Court in considering the charge against them of false personation for procuring registration of the Heba-nama. The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed. Appeal dismissed. 1963 Stkendar Sluikh •• State of West Bengal Shah, J.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
