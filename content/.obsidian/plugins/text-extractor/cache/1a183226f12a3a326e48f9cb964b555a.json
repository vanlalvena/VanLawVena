The plaintiff’s trademark ZIFI and ZIFI family of trademark have gained popularity and featured in popular magazines and journals concerning the trade in India, such as: http://www.drugsupdate.com http://www.drugs.com http://businesstoday.intoday.in http://www.medschat.com http://www.medindia.net http://www.indiamart.com 14. The plaintiff owns and maintains the websites www.fdcindia.com. On its aforesaid website, the plaintiff had also initially provided a link to “http:zifi.co.in” in respect of its medical formulations being sold under the trademark ZIFI and ZIFI family of trademarks. The said websites of the plaintiff can be accessed from anywhere in the world. The websites contains all information about the drugs manufactured and sold under the trademark ZIFI and ZIFI family of trademarks both for adults and children. They also contain the literature with regard to the use of the medicines of the plaintiff under the said trademarks. The plaintiff also discloses that it has vigilantly protected its mark against infringement by filing oppositions against other applicants successfully. 15. The plaintiff has disclosed — in relation to the defendants, that defendant No. 1 is engaged in the business of providing online services for appointment of doctors, diagnostic centres, spas and salons and other healthcare services under the trading style ZIFFI and ZIFFI.com. Defendant No. 2 is a director of defendant No. 1 company. The plaintiff further states that defendants were offering their online services under the trade mark DocSuggest/DocSuggest.com through their website www.docsuggest.com between February 2010 till end of September 2014. Post the said period, the defendants started using the domain ziffi.com and also re-directed their earlier website www.docsuggest.com to the website www.ziffi.com. 16. The case of the plaintiff is that in September 2014 it discovered from a news article published in the Hindu-Business Line on 29.9.2014, about the user of the mark ZIFFI by the defendants through its website www.ziffi.com. The plaintiff issued a cease and desist notice on 20.10.2014 calling upon the defendant to stop using the trademark/ name ziffi.com in connection with their services, or for any other purpose whatsoever. The defendants sent a reply on 18.11.2014, inter alia, claiming that the defendants mark ZIFFI and its domain name ZIFFI is structurally and visually different and distinct from the plaintiff’s trademarks. Vol. CCXXXVII 31 17. The defendant also applied for registration of ZIFFI with the Registrar of Trademarks on 17.12.2014 claiming user since 30.9.2014 under the various classes, namely, Class 35 and 42. Consequently, the plaintiff has filed the present suit. 18. In para 36 of the plaint, the plaintiff avers as follows: “36. It is submitted that the plaintiff is the rightful registered proprietor and owner of ZIFI and ZIFI FAMILY OF TRADE MARKS and has a reputation and goodwill not only in India but in other countries as well. The trade mark ZIFI is a unique, coined mark, invented by the plaintiff and is being used extensively, continuously since the year 2001, which makes is distinctive and is capable of distinguishing the plaintiff’s goods and business from that of others. Unauthorized adoption and use of a decep- tively similar mark ZIFFI and domain name www.ziffi.com by the defen- dants in relation to their services and business is without permission, dishonest, illegal, unfair, unjustified, without due cause and in bad faith. Such unauthorized use of the plaintiff’s registered trade mark by the defendant, even if for dissimilar goods/services is undoubtedly to take unfair advantage of the reputation of the plaintiff’s registered trade marks and is detrimental to its distinctive character. The mala fide intentions of the defendants can also be seen from the very fact that they have directed their earlier website www.docsuggest.com to the impugned domain www.ziffi.com. There is no bona fide reason or explanation given by the defendants for adoption of the trade mark and domain name ZIFFI and www.ziffi.com, which are visually, phonetically and deceptively similar and/or identical to the plaintiff’s ZIFI and ZIFI FAMILY of registered trade marks and domain name www.zifi.co.in respectively. The defen- dants have adopted the mark ZIFFI/ZIFFI.COM to trade upon the im- mense goodwill and transnational reputation enjoyed by the plaintiff. Adoption and use of a similar trade mark and domain name by the defendants is with the sole intention to take unfair advantage of the repute of the plaintiff’s registered trade marks/domain name and is bound to cause confusion and deception in the minds of the public as well as the trade into believing that the services offered by the defendants under the mark ZIFFI/ZIFFI.COM have some association or connection with the goods and business of the plaintiff, when in fact, there is no such connec- tion or association whatsoever. Such unsolicited use of the trade mark ZIFFI and domain name www.ziffi.com by the defendants takes unfair advantage of and is detrimental to the distinctive character, goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff’s registered trade mark ZIFI and ZIFI FAMILY OF TRADE MARKS, as well as its domain name www.zifi.co.in. The pharmaceutical goods manufactured by the plaintiff under the trade mark ZIFI and its variations, for purchase and use by patients, and the online services offered by the defendants under the name ZIFFI through its website www.ziffi.com, which allows users to book appointments with doctors, diagnostic centres, salons and other healthcare services, are in respect of similar target customer base/clientele. Hence, in these circum- stances, confusion and deception is bound to take place, which is diluting the uniqueness and distinctiveness of the plaintiff’s registered trade mark FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES32 (Feb.) 2017 ZIFI as well as domain name www.zifi.co.in. The defendants have no legitimate rights or interest to use the impugned trade mark and domain name ZIFFI/ZIFFI.COM or any other trade mark visually, phonetically, structurally, confusingly and deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s regis- tered trade mark, therefore, will not suffer any loss, if they are restrained from using the trade mark impugned trade mark ZIFFI/ZIFFI.COM in relation to their services and business.” 19. Thus, the plaintiff claims infringement of its registered trademark ZIFI and ZIFI family of trademarks and its domain name zifi.co.in. In the plaintiffs aforesaid application, the plaintiff has sought an injunction restraining the defen- dants by themselves, their partners, proprietors, directors, agents, servants, licens- ees, franchisees, representatives and employees or any one claiming under them or authorized from, in any manner, directly or indirectly using the mark ZIFFI/ ZIFFI.COM or any other confusingly/ deceptively similar mark in respect of their business/ services so as to infringe the plaintiff’s registered trademark ZIFI and ZIFI family of trademarks. The plaintiff is also claiming an action of passing off against the defendants for passing off the defendants’ services, website and business as that of the plaintiffs. 20. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff, Ms. Shwetasree Majumder submits that the domain name “Ziffi.com” was neither coined, nor created by the defendants, as alleged. In fact, the said domain name was created by a third party called Fabulous Domains on November 30, 2004 and it remained in their name until June, 2014. According to the plaintiff, the same was put up for sale for $949 by Fabulous Domains, and the defendant No. 2 appears to have purchased it on or about June 20, 2014. It is submitted that the defendants started their business operation with the offending domain name only from September 30, 2014. 21. As regards adoption of the mark ‘Ziffi’ by the defendants, Ms. Majumder submits that the defendants have provided no acceptable or plausible reason for the change in their trade name/domain name from DocSuggest/docsuggest.com to Ziffi.com. The defendants had the option of choosing any mark/domain name, however, they deliberately chose ‘Ziffi’. The defendants claim to have adopted “Ziffi” from the term “Jiffy”-to signify their “quick” and “speedy” service, but they could have, very well, chosen another name connoting the same meaning or essence. Ms. Majumder also submits that retaining of the letter “i” also casts a shadow of doubt on the defendants as their alleged mark reads as “Ziffi” with an “i” instead of “Ziffy” with a “y”. She states that in trademark law, a subsequent user has a higher onus to prove the honest adoption of the mark impugned, more specifically in cases of a coined/ arbitrary mark. She places reliance upon the following decisions, wherein the Courts were not convinced with the explanations for adoption of the respective marks by the defendants: (i) Simatul Chemical Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. Cibatul Ltd., AIR 1978 Guj. 216 (ii) Rolex SA v. Alex Jewellery Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., 2009 (41) PTC 284 (Del.) (iii) M/s. Satyam Infoway v. M/s Sifynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd., IV (2004) SLT 219=AIR 2004 SC 3540 Vol. CCXXXVII 33 (iv) Honda Motors Co. Ltd. v. Charanjit Singh & Ors., 101 (2002) DLT 359=2003 (26) PTC 1 (Del.). 22. Ms. Majumder submits that the present case is essentially falling under Clause (2)(b) of Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter “the Act”) as the goods of the plaintiff and the services of the defendants are allied and cognate. She further submits that comparison of two marks, in light of the goods/services for which they are used, cannot be restricted to a goods vs. goods spectrum or a services vs. services spectrum. She states that modern trademark law has transgressed from the above, and similarity in goods and services is now being viewed from an overall perspective. To substantiate the same, she placed reliance on different instances of infringement under Section 29 of the Act. She submitted infringement, post the repealing of the Trade and Merchandise Act, 1958 has extended to using of a registered trademark on business papers and advertising [See Section 29(6)(d)] and to the use of spoken words, forming a part of a trademark and visual representation of such words [See Section 29(9)]. 23. She submits that the defendants’ services are in respect of the common target customer base and clientele i.e. Doctors and consumers/patients availing services of Doctors, diagnostic clinics and healthcare services. It is submitted that the promotional activities of the plaintiff extends to doctors’, physicians’ and diagnostic clinics by way of posters, labels, stationary etc., and the defendants are also engaged in the booking of doctors’ appointments and diagnostic clinics etc. Thus, as per the plaintiff, business of the plaintiff and the defendants are allied, cognate and related. Reliance is placed on the discussion on related goods in McCarthy on “Trademarks and Unfair Competition”. The learned author states as follows: “Goods and Services Can be “Related” Without Being Competitive.—To be “related” in the parlance of trademark law, the conflicting good or services do not have to be in competition with each others. That the goods or services are non-competitive does not answer the question of whether the goods are so “related” that a reasonable buyer is likely to think that defendant’s goods or services are somehow connected with, or sponsored by, the plaintiff, due to similar marks. There is no simple, one-question test for determining whether non-competitive products are “related” such that confusion is likely as to source, affiliation, connection or sponsorship. What Does “Related” Mean? Goods are “related”, not because of any inherent common quality of the respective goods, but “related” in the sense that buyers are likely to believe that such goods, similarly marked, come from the same source, or are somehow connected with or sponsored by a common company. As the Federal Circuit observed, “related” means related in the minds of poten- tial buyers: [G]oods that are neither used together nor related to one another in kind may still “be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin of the goods. It is this sense of relatedness that matters in the likelihood of confusion analysis.” “Related” does not mean that there is necessarily any physical relation- ship between the goods or services identified by the conflicting marks. Rather, it means that the marks as used are “related” in the mind of the FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES34 (Feb.) 2017 consuming public. Goods are “related” if customers are likely to mistakenly think that the infringer’s goods come from the same source as the senior user’s goods or are sponsored by, affiliated with or connected with the senior user. As the Ninth Circuit stated: “The [defendant’s] use need not be the same as, nor one in competition with the original use. The question is, are the uses so related that they are likely to be connected in the mind of a prospective purchaser?.........” [Emphasis supplied] 24. Ms. Majumder submits that healthcare industry, these days, is not only concerned with dispensation of medicines alone, but has outreached other areas as well. She cites some real life examples, namely of, — “MAX’ India” — which cover areas of not just dispensation/pharmacy, but surgery, health insurance, and online appointment of doctors; ‘Jindal Group’ — which covers, inter alia, areas of steel, petroleum, cement and institute of naturopathy; ‘Mylan’ — which covers manufac- ture and marketing of pharmaceutical products and philanthropic services as well. She submits that pharmaceutical industry has graduated to being called life sciences, and now it’s referred to as the healthcare industry. Thus, defendants’ services of online booking of doctors, diagnostics, spas, salons etc. fall under the “healthcare industry” which is inclusive of the dispensation of medicines/pharma- ceutical products of the plaintiff. 25. In support of the submission on allied and cognate goods/services, Ms. Majumder relies upon the following cases: (i) Bajaj Electricals Limited v. Metal & Allied Products and Another, AIR 1988 Bom.167: (ii) Essel Packaging Limited and Others v. Essel Tea Exports Ltd., 1999 PTC (19) 521. (iii) T.V. Venugopal v. Ushodaya Enterprises Ltd. & Another, II (2011) SLT 477=2011 (45) PTC 433 (SC). (iv) Honda Motors (supra) 26. Ms. Majumder submits that the defendants are using the mark ‘Ziffi’ very prominently at the time of booking appointments, and are soliciting feedback using domain name ziffi.com. They are also using e-mail ids such as info@ziffi.com, support@ziffi.com and team@ziffi.com while communicating with their patients/ users/customers. Further, the website listings/classifieds on third party search engines have the name ‘Ziffi’ appearing. She submits that the only difference between the trademark ‘Zifi’ of the plaintiff, and impugned mark ‘Ziffi’ of the defendants, is the extra letter ‘f’ in the defendants mark, and an unwary customer with average recall capacity-who purchases ZIFI range of medicinal and healthcare products, and also books appointments for a doctors clinic, or spa, or for diagnostic services, through the defendants’ website, is likely to get confused and get misled into drawing a business association between the plaintiff and the defendants. She submits that the marks ‘Zifi’ and ‘Ziffi’ are structurally and visually similar, and phonetically identical. She points out that the standard of awareness expected of an average customer, in such matters, is not that of a well informed and aware consumer-who is well aware of various products in the market, but of a consumer who is unwary, having average intelligence and recollection. An unwary consumer Vol. CCXXXVII 35 of average intelligence would, in all likelihood, get confused and/or deceived with regard to the two marks ‘ZIFI’ and ‘ZIFFI’-the only difference being one extra letter ‘f’ in the defendants mark, and take one for the other. She also submits that a junior/ subsequent user has a higher degree of onus to prove that no confusion would be caused, or is likely to be caused, by its entry in the market. Ms. Majumder submits that the defendants have failed to prove the same. 27. Ms. Majumder submits that the association between DocSuggest and ‘Ziffi’ is discernible only from the website of the defendants. Thus, if a consumer were to look for the plaintiff’s product on the internet, he is likely to log into the defendants’ website, believing it to be that of the plaintiff. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff relies upon McCarthy on ‘Trademarks and Unfair Competition, Vol. 4 to submit that the defendant is guilty of ‘initial interest confusion’. The learned author in the said work states as follows: “Initial Interest Confusion Defined. Infringement can be based upon confu- sion that creates initial customer interest, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of confusion. Most Courts now recognize the initial interest confusion theory as a form of likelihood of confusion. xx xx xx Initial Interest Confusion on the Internet: Domain Names. Courts have applied the initial interest test of infringement to domain names that conflict with a prior trademark. Some Courts held that a disclaimer on an otherwise infringing Web site does not remedy the initial interest confu- sion which is caused by a confusingly similar domain name. If the web user is using the trademark because she is looking for the site of the company that owns the mark, initial interest confusion caused by the domain name may deceive and lure the web user to the defendant’s Web site. Even though when the user accesses the defendant’s site, she finds that it is not the plaintiff’s site, the defendant has succeeded in luring users to his site, which often is the defendant’s main purpose. xx xx xx An Analogy. The analogy to trademark initial interest confusion is a job- seeker who misrepresents educational background on a resume, obtains an interview and at the interview explains that the inflated resume claim is a mistake or a “typo”. The misrepresentation has enabled the job-seeker to obtain a coveted interview, a clear advantage over others with the same background who honestly stated their educational achievements on their resume. In such a situation, it is not possible to say that the misrepresen- tation caused no competitive damage.” [Emphasis supplied] She also relies upon the following cases in this regard: (i) Brookfield Communications Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corpo- ration, 174 F.3d 1036; (ii) Playboy Enterprises Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corporation, 354 F.3d 1020. 28. Ms. Majumder submits that even if the goods/services are considered dissimilar, the plaintiff’s case is covered under Clause (4) of Section 29 of the Act. FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES36 (Feb.) 2017 She submits that plaintiff’s mark “ZIFI” has reputation in the country, and defen- dants’ use of the impugned mark ‘ZIFFI’ tantamounts to the defendant taking unfair advantage of the plaintiff’s mark (as it causes source identification confu- sion/initial interest confusion) and the same is detrimental to the distinctive character and/or repute of the plaintiffs registered trade mark. The same is detrimental to the distinctive character as it leads to dilution of the plaintiff’s trade mark and would adversely impact the plaintiff’s reputation on account of the substandard services of the defendant and the obvious source identification confu- sion diluting the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff’s trademark. She relies upon the following cases wherein injunctions were granted for dis-similar goods: (i) Dharampal Satyapal Limited v. Suneel Kumar Rajput & Anr., 204 (2013) DLT 348=2013 (56) PTC 116 (Del.). (ii) Industria De Diseno Textile SA v. Orinetal Cuisines Pvt. Ltd., 220 (2015) DLT 679=MIPR 2015 (2) 125. (iii) Bloomberg Finance LLP v. Prafull Saklecha & Ors., 2013 (DLT SOFT) 364=2013 (56) PTC 243 (Del.) (iv) Brahmos Aerospace Pvt. Ltd. v. FIIT JEE Ltd., 2014 (DLT SOFT) 337=2014 (58) PTC 90 (Del.). Defendants’ submissions: 29. The defendants submit that they are in the business of providing an online platform that allows its users to book appointments with salons, spas, doctors, diagnostic centers and other wellness related facilities. They are currently operat- ing in the cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune using the website “www.Ziffi.com”. It is the submission of the Defendants that presently, they are providing services to book appointments only with salons and spas in these aforementioned cities. Thus, the submission is that there is no similarity or overlap in the business of the plaintiff and that of the defendant. 30. The defendants submit that they commenced their business of online booking services for appointments with doctors and diagnostic tests from about February, 2010 under the name of “docsuggest.com/docsuggest” in the city of Hyderabad, and gradually expanded to Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Pune. The defendants expanded the sphere of their business from booking doctor appoint- ments to salons, spas and general wellness related facilities. As a result of this, they changed their trade name from “docsuggest.com/docsuggest” to ‘Ziffi.com/Ziffi’ to avoid their target users from getting an impression that their services are only limited to fixing doctor’s appointments. The defendants submit that though the said domain name was created in the year 2004, it was not used until the defendant No.1 decided to adopt the name and mark ‘Ziffi.com’ around June, 2014. 31. The defendants submit that they coined the word ‘Ziffi’ keeping in mind the nature and the manner in which the defendant No. 1 provides business of online appointment booking services in a quick, speedy and efficient manner to the customer intending to avail its services through the website. The term “Ziffi”, according to the defendants, has been derived from the word “Jiffy” which means “very quick” or “in a fraction of a second”. Vol. CCXXXVII 37 32. The defendants state that their network has over 5500 salons & spas, and over 4000 stylists in its network as of February 2016. They enjoy registrations of over 3,60,000 users in a span of just one year for the business of spas and salons, and have received over 1,200,000 appointment requests only through its mobile app. The defendants claim to have spent over INR 26 crores in promotion, advertisement, operations of www.ziffi.com since its rebranding to “Ziffi/Ziffi.com”. 33. The defendants submit that pursuant to receiving the cease and desist notice sent by the plaintiff, they filed caveats in November 2014 before this Court and Courts at Bombay, Bangalore and Hyderabad which all expired in the month of February, 2015. It is the submission of the defendants that the plaintiff waited for the caveats to expire to file the present suit in March 2015, and obtained an ex-parte interim order on 6.4.2015. 34. It is the case of the defendants that the plaintiff is engaged only in the business of ‘manufacturing and marketing medicinal and pharmaceutical formu- lations in India and abroad’ and, consequently, the line of business and target customers of both parties are entirely different from each other. They are not related, cognate, or allied businesses in any manner. The trade channels through which the plaintiff and the defendants sell their respective products/services are entirely different. Further, the classes of customers of the plaintiff and the defen- dants are entirely different, and even the mode of purchase of goods/availing services is different. In support of this submission, learned Senior Counsel for the defendants, Mr. Anil Sapra places reliance upon Kamdhenu Ispat Limited v. Kamdhenu Pickles, 173 (2010) DLT 540=2011 (46) PTC 152 (Del.); Raymond Ltd. v. Raymond Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., MIPR 2007 (2) 67; Marc Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. v. Five Star Electricals (India) & Anr., ILR 2008 (II) Del. 771; Intel Corporation v. Anil Hada, (2006) 33 PTC 553; First Computers (Formerly) known as ‘Brilliant’s’ Com- puter Centre v. A. Guruprasad, 1995-2-LW 486; Aravind Laboratories v. Infotek Software & Systems Pvt. Ltd., O.A. No. 77 of 2011 in C.S. No. 57 of 2011 decided on 15.6.2012; Nestle Products v. Milkmaid Corporation, AIR 1974 Del. 40; Roshan Lal Oil Mills v. Assam Company Ltd., 64 (1996) DLT 52; Sony Kabushiki Kaisha v. Shamroa Maskar and Ors., AIR 1985 Bom. 327; Rustom Ali Molla and Ors. v. Bata Shoe Co. Ltd., AIR 1957 Cal. 120; and ITC Ltd. v. Philip Morris Products, 166 (2010) DLT 177 wherein injunction was refused on the ground that the goods/services were not allied/cognate. Mr. Sapra also relies upon Sona Spice Pvt. Ltd. v. Soongachi Tea Industries Pvt. Ltd., 2007 (34) PTC 91 (Del.), wherein the Court rejected the prayer for injunction of trademark, ‘Sona’-which was being used for spices by the plaintiff, and for tea by the defendants. Mr. Sapra submits that allied and cognate goods must fall within the same class, and since the goods of the plaintiff and the services of the defendants are falling in different classes, no question of them being allied and cognate arises and, as a consequence, Section 29(2) of the Act is not attracted. 35. The defendants assert that use of the word “Ziffi/Ziffi.com” by the defendants would not create any confusion, as there is no reason for the customers/ users who book appointments through the online platform of the defendant to associate or connect such online booking services for appointment of spas, doctors, diagnostic centres etc. to plaintiffs trademark ‘ZIFI’ in respect of its medicinal products. FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES38 (Feb.) 2017 36. It is submitted that the targeted customers of the services of the defendant are educated, and are capable of making informed choices, and in support of the same reliance is placed on Intel Corporation Inc. v. CPM United Kingdom Ltd., (2006) EWHC 1878 (Ch), wherein the customers of the defendants’ telemarketing services were corporate clients who were able to make informed choices and did not assume any link between the plaintiffs products marketed under the mark INTEL, and defendants’ telemarketing services offered under the mark INTELMARK. Reliance is also placed on Khoday Distilleries Ltd. v. Scotch Whiskey Association, (2008) 10 SCC 723 in this regard. Learned Counsel further submits that the consumer base of the plaintiffs and the defendants is entirely different, and places reliance upon Skol Breweries v. Unisafe Technologies, 173 (2010) DLT 453=2010 (44) PTC 209 (Del.) wherein the plaintiff was using the mark KNOCK OUT for beer, and the defendant was using the same mark for pepper spray. This Court in Para 19 observed: “The Court is conscious that though the competing marks are similar, the consumer base is entirely different, as is the product. There is nothing to show that trade channels are common, or that the Plaintiff’s marks have acquired such degree of secondary distinctiveness that the term KNOCK OUT certainly, or almost invariably implies it or its product.” 37. The defendants submit that their services are available only for the masses in four cities viz. Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Mr. Sapra submits that the medicinal products sold under the plaintiff’s trade mark ‘ZIFI’ are all prescrip- tion drugs, which cannot be sold over the counter to the general public without a Doctor’s prescription. He submits that the medicine “ZIFI” of the plaintiff is one out of 300 medicines that they manufacture and is used by only limited customers having diseases which are cured by the antibiotic Cefixime. 38. Mr. Sapra submits that since the defendants communicate with doctors, diagnostic centres, other services providers, and its users by using the name, “DocSuggest Healthcare Services Private Limited”, there cannot be any confusion in the mind of doctors, diagnostic centres, or even average customers/users with an average intelligence — who avail services of the defendants under the trade name “Ziffi/Ziffi.com”, that the defendants are in any manner associated or connected with the plaintiff. 39. He submits that ‘ZIFI’ and ‘Ziffi.com/Ziffi’ are structurally, visually and conceptually different and distinct. The font, size, and manner in which the word “Ziffi/Ziffi.com” is used by the defendant is entirely different from that of the plaintiff’s trademark ZIFI and its family of trademarks. Further, the plaintiff itself has acknowledged the structural dissimilarity by filing and obtaining registrations for marks ZIFI, ZIFI 200, ZIFI 100 DT and ZIFI 50 under registration Nos. 995613, 1041491, 1041490 and 1105943. 40. Mr. Sapra submits that the present case falls under Section 29 (4) of the Act, which defines as to when a registered trade mark is infringed in the case of dissimilar goods and services. He submits that the ingredients of Section 29(4) are not met in the present case. Learned Counsel submits that the plaintiff has failed to disclose any reputation in India. Further, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the adoption by the defendants of the mark in question is without due cause, and how Vol. CCXXXVII 39 the defendants are taking unfair advantage, or how the adoption of the mark ZIFFI/ ZIFFI.COM by the defendants is detrimental to the reputation of the plaintiffs. Reliance is placed on Blue Hills Logistics Pvt. Ltd. v. Ashok Leyland, 2011 (48) PTC 564 Mad., in this regard. He relies on the decision of Nestle India v. Mood Hospitality Private Limited, 168 (2010) DLT 663 (DB)=2010 (42) PTC 514 (Del.), and Kamdhenu Ispat Limited v. Kamdhenu Pickels & Spices Ind. Pvt. Ltd. (supra) to submit that all conditions of Section 29(4) must be satisfied before an injunction is granted, and there is no presumption of infringement in a case to which Section 29(4) is applicable. 41. Mr. Sapra further submits that use of the mark “ZIFFI” is not without due cause, because the defendants have from the very beginning indicated the change of its mark from DocSuggest to Ziffi. There has been no hiding in this regard. The corporate name “DocSuggest” appears on all forms of the defendants. They have made conscious effort to promote the change of its trade name from ‘DocSuggest’ to ‘Ziffi’. The word was spread by publishing a blogpost titled “DocSuggest is transforming in a Ziffi” on their website, by making a declaration-reading “Your favorite Docsuggest is now Ziffi!” which appears on top of every page on the defendants’ website. All communications with salons, spas, doctors, diagnostic centres, and other wellness related service providers are done in the name of DocSuggest Healthcare Private Limited. Further, all forms and applications for registration of the services provided by the defendant has “DocSuggest Healthcare Private Limited” printed on top. The defendants, therefore, are not taking any unfair advantage of the plaintiff’s mark. Further, the plaintiff has failed to produce any document/ material on record to show that there has been any actual confusion or unfair advantage to the defendant. He states that the only document containing around five negative comments/review about the defendants’ services is not sufficient to establish erosion of reputation of plaintiff’s mark. Reliance in this regard is placed on Aravind Laboratories (supra). 42. The defendants further submit that they are prior users of the mark for services covered under Class 35 and 42 of the Schedule to the Act, and by virtue of Section 34 of the Act, the defendants cannot be held liable for infringement. The defendants submit that the user of the plaintiff has been claimed since 2001 in respect of goods mentioned in Class 5 of the Schedule to the Act i.e. medicinal, pharma and veterinary preparations only, whereas the domain name ZIFFI.COM was created and registered by the predecessor of the defendants in November, 2004. Reliance is placed on Rikhab Chand Jain v. T.T. Enterprises, 2013 (54) PTC 489 (Del.); S. Narendra Kumar v. Everest Beverages, 2008 (37) PTC 497 Del.; and Sona Spice (supra). 43. Learned Counsel for the defendant further submits that no case of passing off has been made out by the Plaintiff. He relies on the test laid down in the case of Cadila Healthcare Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., III (2001) SLT 225=(2001) 5 SCC 73, in support of his submissions. 44. In her rejoinder, Ms. Majumder submits that defendant’s website and mobile application have certain negative reviews. Further, hits on the site of the defendants pertain to Docsuggest, and not Ziffi. She further submits that a defence premised on equity by the infringer is not a relevant consideration for grant or non- grant of injunction and relies upon the following cases to support her submission: FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES40 (Feb.) 2017 (i) Apple Computer Inc. v. Apple Leasing & Industries, (1950-2000) Suppl. (2) PTC 45 (Del.); (ii) Satyam Infoway (supra). 45. Ms. Majumder submits that there is no delay in filing the suit, as the plaintiff issued a cease and desist notice to the defendants on 20.10.2014 soon after learning of the defendants use of the mark, ‘Ziffi’ on or about September 29, 2014. The plaintiff waited for the defendant to make amends. Since the use of the infringing mark did not stop, the plaintiff filed the present suit on 26.3.2015. Learned Counsel submits that, in any event, delay in initiation of action is not a defence, and would not be a reason to permit continued infringement by the defendants. In this regard, the Plaintiff relies upon the following case laws: (i) M/s Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s India Stationary Products Co. and Another, AIR 1990 Del. 19; (ii) Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. v. Reddy Pharmaceuticals Limited, 113 (2004) DLT 363=2004 (29) PTC 435 (Del.); (iii) Beiersdorf A.G. v. Ajay Sukhwani, 156 (2009) DLT 83=2009 (39) PTC 38 (Del.). Discussion and Decision 46. Having heard the Counsel for both parties and considered their respective submissions and documents, I am of the prima facie view that the plaintiff has made out a case for grant of ad interim injunction as prayed for. 47. There can be no doubt, and it needs no discussion to say that the mark “Zifi” of the plaintiff and “Ziffi” of the defendant are phonetically, structurally and visually similar. In any event, this aspect is also discussed a little later. The prime issue in this case, therefore, is whether the goods of the plaintiff and the services of the defendants are allied/ cognate or not. Allied/cognate goods or services, as understood from the material referred to below, are those goods/services which are not identical, but can be said to be related or similar in nature (See McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition, Fourth Edition, Vol 5). The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles Fifth Edition 2002, Vol. 1. defines the term “Allied” as “connected by nature or qualities; having affinity” and the term “Cognate” as “akin in origin, nature or quality”. Reference may also be made to New Webster’s Dictionary and Thesaurus of the English Language, 1992 which defines “Allied” as “relating in subject or kind” and “Cognate” as “1. adj. having a common ancestor or origin|| (of languages or words) having a common source or root|| (of subjects etc.) related, naturally grouped together.”. Cognate goods/ services can be described, inter alia, as goods or services which have a trade connection — as in glucose and biscuits (See Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., 1959 (SLT SOFT) 17=AIR 1960 SC 142) or which are intended for the same class of customers — as in television picture tubes (parts thereof, video tapes and cassettes and television tuners etc.) and televisions, tuners and T.V. Kits (See Prakash Industries Ltd. v. Rajan Enterprises, (1994) 14 PTC 31), or are comple- mentary to each other — as in toothbrushes and toothpaste (See HM Sariya v. Ajanta India Ltd., (2006) 33 PTC 4). Vol. CCXXXVII 41 48. In the present case, the plaintiff is using the registered mark ‘Zifi’ for goods falling under Class 05 of the Schedule of the Act i.e. pertaining to pharmaceutical preparations. On the other hand, the defendants are using the mark ‘Ziffi’ for booking of appointments for doctors, diagnostics, spas and salons, and have applied for registration under Class 35 and 42 of the Schedule of the Act. It is the submission of the defendant that goods and services falling under different classes cannot be allied and cognate. I do not find merit in this submission. The classifica- tion of goods and services under Section 7 of the Act is not the criterion for deciding the question of similarity in goods/services. Reliance may be placed on K.C. Kailasam/Ramu Vedaraman’s Law on Trade Marks & Geographical Indications 1st Edition, 2003 wherein, the learned author on Page 180 has stated as under: “Classification of goods given in the rules not the criterion—Whether or not two sets of goods or services are of the same description is not be decided on the basis of the classification of goods and services given in the 4th schedule to the Trade Marks Rules, 2002. The description of goods may be narrower or wider than any of the classes according to the circumstances of the case. As was observed by LINDLEY J., in the Australian Wine Importers Trade Mark case [(1889) 6 RPC 311]. “If you come to look at that classification, you will find goods of the same description, in one sense, in different classes; and you will find goods of different description in the same class”. “ Similarity between goods and services 49. Now, to determine whether the defendants’ services are allied and cognate to plaintiff’s goods, it is essential to first discuss the law on similarity in goods/ services in trademarks and its development so far. While the Act is silent on the factors to be considered for similarity in goods/services, the Courts in India — relying upon international cases and literature, have consolidated the guiding principles and factors found relevant in ascertaining the similarity between goods/ services. They are as follows: 1. In Assam Roofing Ltd. & Ors. v. JSB Cement LLP & Ors., 2015 SCC Online Cal 6581, the learned Single Judge in Para 80 observes — “The test of similarity of goods is looked at from a business and commercial point of view. The nature and composition of the goods, the respective uses of the articles and the trade channels through which they are brought and sold all go into consideration in this context.” (empha- sis supplied) 2. In Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 15th Edition 2011, the learned Author in Para 9-073 has stated as under: “As para.23 of the decision in Canon v. MQM, (1999) R.P.C. 117 makes clear, all factors relating to the goods or services themselves must be taken into account. These include, inter alia, their nature, their intended purpose, their method of use and whether they are in competition with each other or are complementary. It is clear that goods in different classes may nevertheless be considered similar, and likewise that goods or services within the same class may be found to not be similar.” FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES42 (Feb.) 2017 3. In Para 9-075, the Learned Author has mentioned some illustrations on similar goods or services including under Para 9-078 “Services offered by beauty salons; solarium services” similar to “business assistance with beauty preparations, sales” and “beauty prepara- tions, perfumery, cosmetics dietetic substances”. The said illustra- tion sources from the case of Beauty Shop Application v. Opposition of Evora, BV [1999] E.T.M.R. 20, wherein the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) also known as the Opposition Division held the defendant’s services to be similar to the plaintiff’s services and goods by observing that “the goods and services of the conflicting marks could be offered together and be intended for the same public.” 4. In British Sugar Plc. v. James Robertson & Sons Ltd., [1996] R.P.C. 281 at 294-297, relied upon in Balkrishna Hatcheries v. Nandos Interna- tional Ltd. and Anr., 2007 SCC OnLine Bom 449 and Advance Magazine Publishers, Inc. and Ors. v. Just Lifestyle Pvt. Ltd., 2016 SCC Online Bom 8417 , the Court laid down the objective test for similarity of description of goods/services as follows: “(a) The uses of the respective goods or services; (b) The users of the respective goods or services; (c) The physical nature of the goods or acts of service; (d) The trade channels through which the goods or services reach the market; (e) In the case of self-serve consumer items, where in practice they are respectively found or likely to be found in supermarkets and in particular whether they are, or are likely to be, found on the same or different shelves; and (f) The extent to which the respective goods and services are in competition with each other: that inquiry may take into ac- count how those in trade classify goods, for instance whether market research companies, who of course act for industry, put goods or services in the same or different sectors.” 5. Kerly 15th ed. while relying upon Canon (supra), further observes in Para 9-065 that the element of distinctive character of a trademark and its reputation is also viewed when determining similarity between the goods and services and whether such similarity is sufficient to give rise to the likelihood of confusion. 50. On the application of aforesaid principles, I am of the view that the plaintiff’s goods are similar to and associated with the defendants’ services. The reasons for the same are: (i) Respective uses of goods/services—Plaintiff’s products are a wide range of medicines used to treat several diseases including typhoid, bron- chitis, fever & infection, etc. Defendants’ services, inter alia, includes the fixing of appointment of doctors/diagnostics for medical check- Vol. CCXXXVII 43 ups to be treated for several diseases, including the ones treated by plaintiff’s medicinal range, with the mark in question; (ii) Intended Purpose—Plaintiff’s products intend to achieve the cure/ prevention of several diseases. Defendants’ services are meant for booking of appointment of, inter alia, doctors/diagnostic for curing and possibly further prevention of several diseases, including the ones treated by the plaintiff’s medicines under the mark in question; (iii) Respective Users of goods/services—Users of plaintiff’s products are patients. Users of defendants’ services are also, inter alia, patients. They are health care seekers. The target customer base and clientele of the two marks is likely to have an overlap, especially amongst doctors, and consumers/patients availing services of doctors, diag- nostic clinics and healthcare services. A consumer of the plaintiffs products (though they are prescription drugs) may visit the defen- dants’ website and is likely to get confused and mislead into think- ing that the services offered by the defendants are coming from the same source as the goods/medicines of the plaintiff.; (iv) Physical Nature of goods/services—Plaintiff’s products are medicines which are prescribed by doctors. Defendants’ services are online booking services for obtaining appointments, inter alia, with doc- tors/diagnostic centres, which requires the user of the services to visit the clinic/hospital to get him/her treated and get prescribed medicines by the doctor, if required; (v) Sector—Both the goods viz. medicines with the mark in question, and services of the defendants under the impugned mark pertain to the healthcare and medicinal sector; (vi) Trade Channels—The plaintiff’s products are medicines which are available at dispensaries; at the chemists, or; at the doctor’s clinic. Defendants’ services are to provide online appointment of doctors, who may prescribe the user of such service with any of the plaintiff’s product. Moreover, since both fall under the same sector of healthcare, it is difficult to negate that there cannot be any overlap in the two. It is also a fact — of which the Court can take notice that organizations who have established themselves in a particular field have the tendency to diversify into related fields. Thus, an unwary customer of the plaintiff is likely to draw an association with the service offered by the defendant - also in the healthcare sector, which included fixing of Doctors appointments; (vii) Reputation—The sales figures; promotional expenses; the advance- ment of the Zifi products for adult and pediatric range of medicines; trademark registrations; the spread of the Zifi products and Zifi family of trademarks in India, and to countries outside India, as well as the international and national accreditations and awards received by the plaintiff, prima facie, establish that the plaintiff has built a strong reputation with its distinctive mark “Zifi” within the medici- FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES44 (Feb.) 2017 nal and pharmaceutical sector in the past 17 years in India. The mark, by virtue of its prolonged use and arbitrary adoption, has main- tained an inherently distinctive character, such that a user is likely to get confused if he were to see the identical/similar mark being used for related services in the healthcare space, like that of the defendants. It is, thus, apparent that there is similarity and association between the plaintiff’s products and the defendants’ services. 51. Section 29 of the Act sets out as to what constitutes infringement of a registered trade mark. Similarity between the two marks is also defined as an infringement. Infringement involving allied/cognate goods and services is covered by Section 29(2)(b), which reads as follows: 29. Infringement of registered trade marks.— (1) .............. (2) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which because of— (a) ............................. (b) its similarity to the registered trade mark and the identity or similar- ity of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark; or (c) .................................... is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public, or which is likely to have an association with the registered trade mark. Pertinently, this provision was introduced for the first time in the Act of 1999, which replaced the erstwhile Trade and Merchandise Act, 1958. The earlier Act only provided for one instance of infringement, which today, forms part of Clause (1) of Section 29. Prior to the Act of 1999, in cases of similarity in goods and services, an action of passing off would lie. Such a right had been recognized as early as in the 1930s in Thomas Bear and Sons (India) v. Prayag Narain, AIR1935 All 7. On a difference of opinion between two learned judges, the learned Single Judge observed as follows: “The rule deducible from the foregoing cases appears to be that the plaintiffs, whose goods have acquired a reputation in the market through a trade mark or name with which their goods have become associated, have a right to restrain the defendant from using, a trade mark or name which is identical with or similar to that of the plaintiffs, and such right extends not only to the particular goods sold by the plaintiffs, but also to cognate classes of goods, provided the cumulative effect of the similarity of the mark, of the commercial connection between the plaintiffs’ goods and those of the defendant, and surrounding circumstances is such as to lead the unwary customers to mistake the defendant’s goods for those of the plaintiffs.” (Emphasis supplied) Vol. CCXXXVII 45 52. The Bombay High Court has further ruled in Essel Packaging Limited and Others v. Essel Tea Exports Ltd., 1999 PTC (19) 521 while relying upon Kirloskar Diesel Recon Pvt. Ltd. v. Kirloskar Proprietary Ltd., AIR 1996 Bom. 146, that “With the passage of time the law on requirement of common field of activity in a passing off action has radically undergone a change and, according to the learned Single Judge, there is no requirement for a common field of activity to found a claim in passing off because the real question in each of such cases is whether there is, as a result of mis-representation, a real likelihood of confusion or deception of the public and consequent damage to the plaintiffs is likely to be caused and if that is the test then the focus is shifted from the external objective test of making compari- son of activities of parties to the state of mind of public in deciding whether it will be confused.” Similarity of the two marks: 53. The degree of similarity between the marks concerned can be assessed from their visual, structural and phonetic similarity. Apart from the visual and phonetic similarity, factors like class of users, distinctive character of the registered trademark, imperfect recollection of the average consumer, and overall impression of the mark are considered in ascertaining similarity between two marks. The Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, 1964 (SLT SOFT) 289=AIR 1965 SC 980(1), in para 28 observed as follows: “In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that use of the defendant’s mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff’s rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial....” [Emphasis supplied ] 54. There can be hardly any doubt that the defendants’ mark ‘Ziffi’ is visually, phonetically, and otherwise similar to the Plaintiff’s mark ‘Zifi’. The essential feature of the plaintiff’s mark is the coined/ arbitrary word mark ‘Zifi’. The only minor difference between the two marks in question is that the defendants have added an extra letter ‘f’ after the first use of the said letter. When read and pronounced, the two marks are nearly identical. The use of the second letter ‘f’ merely emphasizes the use of the sound that the said letter produces, when pronounced/spoken. In the normal course, the users would not even take notice when the word “Zifi” or “Ziffi” is spoken, whether there is one, or two letters ‘f’ in the mark. A consumer who comes across the plaintiffs mark at one point of time, and with the defendants mark at another point of time, is not likely to remember the minor and insignificant difference in the two marks, and it is highly likely that he may recall the mark he may have come across earlier, and associate the services of the defendant as coming from the organization of the plaintiff, or vice versa. FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES46 (Feb.) 2017 Confusion on part of the public 55. The Supreme Court in Corn Products (supra), observed that “it is well known that the question whether two marks are likely to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first impression. It is for the Court to decide that question.”. Kerly’s (15th ed.) states in Para 9-047 that “The likelihood of confusion is to be assessed globally, taking into account all factors relevant to the marks and goods and services in issue, and this will include any reputation attaching to the earlier trade mark.” The general principles as stated by Kerly’s in assessing the likelihood of confusion include a global assessment; the relevant public; degree of similarity between the marks; overall impression of the marks; distinctive character of the earlier mark; imperfect recollection; similarity of goods and services. I am of the view that there exists a likelihood of confusion or deception of the public on the defendants’ using the mark ‘Ziffi’. The marks ‘Ziffi’ and ‘Zifi’ are phonetically identical. As discussed, the difference of an extra letter ‘f’ is so minuscule, that an average consumer with imperfect recollection is unlikely to remember the same and, prima facie, would likely get deceived, and confuse one in place of the other. Only a person with an extraordinary or photographic memory would possibly pay attention to such detail, but as held in a catena of judgments, the test to be applied is of a consumer with an average and imperfect memory and recollection. 56. As discussed above, goods and services in question, prima facie, appear to be overlapping. A purchaser of plaintiff’s product may also end up booking an appointment with a doctor/ spa/ salon on the defendants’ platform, and may see plaintiff’s promotional material or find plaintiff’s medicinal products at the same, or another doctor’s clinic or dispensary, or get prescribed plaintiff’s product under the trademark ‘ZIFI’ by the same or some other doctor. This is enough to, prima facie, establish that there is an overlap and linkage in goods and services, as well as the customers of the plaintiff’s product and defendants’ services. 57. In Bajaj Electricals Limited (supra) it was alleged by the defendant that goods manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are totally different and, therefore, the use of the word ‘Bajaj’ causes no confusion in minds of public. The plaintiffs were manufacturing electrical goods and appliances under Class 11 of the Schedule to the Act, whereas the defendants were manufacturing utensils under Class 21 of the Schedule to the Act. The Court held in Para 8 that: “The articles manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are kitchen wares and are commonly used in almost every kitchen in this country. The mere fact that the articles manufactured by the contesting parties are different in nature is no answer to the claim that the defendants are guilty of passing off. We entirely agree with the conclusion recorded by the learned trial Judge that there is identity of the goods, the mark and the consumer and the goods manufactured by both the plaintiffs and the defendants are sold under one shop. Mr. Cooper complained that the electric goods manufactured by the plaintiffs and the stainless steels utensils manufactured by the defendants are not sold in one shop. The submission is not accurate because it is common experience that kitchen ware or kitchen appliances like mixers, grinders, pressure cookers, and stainless steel utensils are sold in the same shop. At this interim stage, we are not prepared to accept the submission of Mr. Cooper on this count and we see no reason to take different view from that of the learned Single Vol. CCXXXVII 47 Judge on this aspect. In our judgment, prima facie, it is clear that the defendants have intentionally and dishonestly tried to pass off their goods by use of name “Bajaj”.” The Court upheld the grant of injunction on account of a similar consumer base. 58. As submitted by Ms. Majumder, there also exists possibility of initial interest confusion in the present matter. An unwary purchaser who is looking for plaintiff’s products on the internet is likely to land up on the website of the defendants’ because of the similarity in the domain names of the plaintiff and the defendants. A customer will not make a conscious effort of adding an extra ‘f’, or removing the extra ‘f’ while looking for the plaintiff’s product. Thus, confusion would arise the moment the customer clicks on the website of the defendant, thinking and believing it to be of the plaintiff, and vice versa. It is immaterial, in a case of initial interest confusion, if the confusion is later removed, once the consumer visits the defendants’ website. 59. Further, the plaintiff has been using the trademark “Zifi” since 2001, whereas the defendants started using the domain name and its mobile application under the mark ‘Ziffi/Ziffi.com’ in November 2014. The plaintiff has demonstrated the growth of its business with its trademark “Zifi”, and how its users have been expanded over the years. By virtue of this prolonged, continuous, growing and uninterrupted use, the plaintiff’s trademark has achieved goodwill and reputation amongst its users. Moreover, the trademark ‘ZIFI’ adopted by the plaintiff is an arbitrary and coined word, making it an inherently distinctive trademark, the character of which has been strengthened by continuous and uninterrupted use. 60. The defendants contend that the goods of the plaintiff are not allied and cognate, but dissimilar to services of the defendants. It is submitted that the case, at best, would be covered by Sub-section (4) of Section 29 of the Act, the ingredients of which have not been satisfied by the plaintiff. This Court is of the opinion that both - the goods of the plaintiff and services of the defendants, stem from the same healthcare sector, and are similar in nature. It, therefore, appears that a case of infringement under Section 29(2) of the Act is made out in the present case. 61. But, even if the Court were to presume that the goods/services in question are not allied or cognate, the defendants are still, prima facie, guilty of infringement under Section 29(4). Section 29(4) reads as under: “29. Infringement of registered trademarks.—(4) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which— (a) is identical with or similar to the registered trade mark, and (b) is used in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade mark is registered, and (c) the registered trade mark has a reputation in India and the use of the mark without due cause takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the registered trade mark.” (Emphasis supplied) 62. To establish a case under Section 29(4), the following ingredients must be present: FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES48 (Feb.) 2017 (a) The trademark, the use of which is claimed to amount to infringe- ment (referred to as the mark under challenge) is identical or similar with a registered trademark; (b) The mark under challenge is used in the course of trade; (c) The mark under challenge is used in relation to dissimilar goods or services, other than the goods or services for which the registered trademark is used; (d) The registered trademark has a reputation in India; (e) Use of the mark under challenge, without due cause, takes unfair advantage to, or is detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the registered trade mark. 63. The defendants rely upon Kamdhenu Ispat Limited (supra) in support of their submission that Section 29(4) is not attracted, wherein the Court declined the relief of injunction for the same mark in relation to dissimilar goods. In my view the said case is distinguishable from the present one, since the trade mark involved therein was “KAMADHENU”, which the Court considered to be a common Indian term with widespread usage within the country, unlike the present case which involves an arbitrary and coined term ‘Zifi’. Moreover, the defendants in the case were prior users than the plaintiff. 64. In Dharampal Satyapal (supra), the Court observed, in respect of Section 29 (4) as follows: “13. Section 29(4) is also distinct from Section 29(1) to (3) of the TM Act in another important aspect. The element of having to demonstrate the likelihood of confusion is absent. Perhaps to balance out this element, the Legislature has mandated the necessity of showing that, (a) the mark has a reputation in India, (b) that the mark has a distinctive character, (c) the use by the infringer is without due cause. In other words, the legislative intent is to afford a stronger protection to a mark that has a reputation without the registered proprietor of such mark having to demonstrate the likelihood of confusion arising from the use of a similar mark in relation to dissimilar goods and services. The words ‘unfair advantage’ and ‘detriment’ in the context of the ‘distinctive character’ and ‘reputation’ of the mark bring in the concept of ‘dilution’. In the context of ‘repute’ they are also relateable to the concept of ‘tarnishment’. The disjunctive ‘or’ between the words ‘distinctive character’ and ‘repute’ is designedly inserted to cater to a situation where a mark may not have a distinctive character and yet may have a reputation. It may not always be necessary for the proprietor of a registered mark to show that it is a ‘well-known trademark’ as defined in Section 2(zg) although if in fact it is, it makes it easier to satisfy the ‘reputation’ requirement of Section 29(4) of the TM Act. The presumption of distinctiveness attached to a registered mark is a rebuttable one. At the interim stage, either of these elements showed be shown prima facie to exist. Whether in fact these elements are satisfied would depend on the evidence led by the parties at trial.” 65. As already observed there is similarity in the two marks, which I have Vol. CCXXXVII 49 already dealt with above. The marks are undoubtedly similar — visually, phoneti- cally as well as structurally. The mark ‘ZIFFI’ of the defendants is being used as a trademark in the course of trade. 66. The plaintiff’s mark ‘ZIFI’ is being used for medicinal and pharmaceutical products, where as the defendants’ mark ‘ZIFFI’ is being used to offer services for online booking for spas, salons, doctors, diagnostic etc through a website and mobile application. The goods and services if taken to be dissimilar, can still be said to be related. Related goods as per McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Compe- tition Vol. 5, need not be the same, or in competition with each other, but should satisfy the test of likelihood of confusion as to source, affiliation, connection or sponsorship as amongst the prospective purchasers. As stated above, the marks in question are so similar that a consumer with an imperfect memory and recollection is likely to associate and connect the defendants’ mark with that of the plaintiffs, and vice versa. 67. The next ingredient to consider in a case under Section 29(4) of the Act is the reputation of the registered trademark. At a prima facie stage, I don’t find it necessary to deal with the question as to whether the plaintiff’s mark is a well known trademark under the Act to establish reputation as mentioned in Section 29(4). Reliance is placed on Bloomberg Finance (supra) in this regard. The learned Single Judge in Para 39, analyzed ‘reputation’ under Section 29(4) of the Act as follows: “39. It may not be necessary for the proprietor of a registered trademark to show that it is a ‘well-known trademark’ as defined in Section 2(zg) although if in fact it is, it makes it easier to satisfy ‘reputation’ requirement of Section 29(4) of the TM Act. The presumption of distinctiveness at- tached to a registered mark is a rebuttable one. At the interim stage, either of these elements should be shown prima facie to exist. Whether in fact these elements are satisfied would depend on the evidence led by the parties at trial.” 68. As aforementioned, the sales figures; promotional expenses; the advance- ment of the ‘Zifi’ products for adult and pediatric range of medicines; Zifi’s reach to more than 300 million patients; the trademark registrations; the spread of the Zifi products and Zifi family of trademarks to countries outside India, as well as the international and national accreditations and awards received by the plaintiff, prima facie, establish that the plaintiff has built a strong reputation within the medicinal and pharmaceutical sector acquired over the past 17 years. In Dharampal Satyal (supra) the Court, inter alia, took note of the sales figures, board hoardings, television shows sponsored by the plaintiff to determine if, prima facie, the plaintiff’s registered mark had a reputation in India. 69. The trademark ‘ZIFI’ by virtue of its arbitrary and coined adoption and use for the past 17 years by the Plaintiffs has become distinctive of its products. In Honda Motors (supra) the plaintiffs were using the mark ‘HONDA’ for automobiles and power equipments, and defendants use of the mark ‘Honda’ was restricted to pressure cookers. The learned Single Judge relied upon the following cases to grant an injunction against the defendants: FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES50 (Feb.) 2017 (a) Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft & Anr. v. Hybo Hindustan, AIR 1994 Del 239 : Mercedes Benz for vehicles and Benz for undergarments; (b) Sunder Parmanand Lalwani & Ors. v. Caltex (India) Ltd., AIR 1969 Bombay 24 (V 56 C5): CALTEX for watches and Caltex India Ltd. for products like lubricants, grease, oils, etc.; (c) Lego System Aktieselskab & Anr. v. Lego M. Lemelstrich Ltd., Fleet Street Reports (1983): LEGO for toys and LEGO for irrigation equip- ment; (d) The Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v. The Dunlop Lubricant Co., 1899 (16) RPC 12: DUNLOP for tyres and DUNLOP for oil and lubricants; (e) Surjit Singh v. M/s Alembic Glass Industries Ltd., AIR 1987 Delhi 319: YERA for glassware and YERA for perfumery and cosmetics; (f) M/s Banga Watch Co. v. M/s N.V. Philips & Anr., AIR 1983 Punjab & Haryana 418: Philips for electrical and electronic goods and Philips for watches and clocks; (g) Bata India Ltd. v. M/s Pyare Lal & Co. & Ors., AIR 1985 Allahabad 242: Bata for canvas, and other footwear and Batafoam for mat- tresses. The learned Single Judge observed in Para 42: “The plaintiff’s business or products under the trade mark HONDA has acquired such goodwill and reputation that it has become distinctive of its products and the defendants’ user of this mark for their product “Pressure Cooker” tends to mislead the public to believe that the defendants business and goods are that of the plaintiff. Such user by the defendants has also diluted and debased the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff.” 70. The Supreme Court in T.V. Venugopal (supra) upheld the grant of injunc- tion against the Defendants (appellants) from using the trademark “Eenadu” for agarbathies. The trademark “Eenadu” — which means “the land” in Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam and “today” in Telegu was being used by the Plaintiffs (respondents) for newspaper and T.V. channels. The Supreme Court observed as follows: “(a) The respondent company’s mark ‘Eenadu’ has acquired extraordi- nary reputation and goodwill in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The respondent company’s products and services are correlated, identi- fied and associated with the word ‘Eenadu’ in the entire State of Andhra Pradesh. ‘Eenadu’ means literally the products or services provided by the respondent company in the State of Andhra Pradesh. In this background the appellant cannot be referred or termed as an honest concurrent user of the mark ‘Eenadu’; (b) ................... (c) ................... (d) Permitting the appellant to sell his product with the mark ‘Eenadu’ in the Vol. CCXXXVII 51 State of Andhra Pradesh would definitely create confusion in the minds of the consumers because the appellant is selling Agarbathies marked ‘Eenadu’ as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that its product Agarbathies are in fact the products of the respondent company. In other words, the appellant wants to ride on the reputation and goodwill of the respondent company. In such a situation, it is the bounden duty and obligation of the Court not only to protect the goodwill and reputation of the respondent company but also to protect the interest of the consumers; (e) ................... (f) ................... (g) Appellant’s deliberate misrepresentation has the potentiality of creating serious confusion and deception for the public at large and the consumers have to be saved from such fraudulent and deceitful conduct of the appellant. (h) Permitting the appellant to sell his product with the mark ‘Eenadu’ would be encroaching on the reputation and goodwill of the respondent company and this would constitute invasion of proprietary rights vested with the respondent company. (i) Honesty and fair play ought to be the basis of the policies in the world of trade and business. The law is consistent that no one can be permitted to encroach upon the reputation and goodwill of other parties. This approach is in consonance with protecting proprietary rights of the respondent company.” (emphasis supplied) 71. The defendants have, without due cause, taken unfair advantage of the plaintiff’s registered trademark. The defendants were using the trademark ‘DocSuggest’ up until September 2014 for its services of online booking. They, in order to expand their services to spas and salons, switched to using the mark ‘ZIFFI’. This explanation does not, prima facie, seem convincing to me. The defen- dants have failed to furnish any cogent reasoning for adoption of an arbitrary term such as ‘ZIFFI’. The justification of the defendants that term — being a misspelling and derived from the word ‘Jiffy’ meaning ‘quick’ and ‘fast’, is not convincing either. There is no explanation as to why “JIFFY” was not adopted by the defendant, much less the defendant has explained as to why it did not adopt “ZIFFY” instead of “ZIFFI”. In Simatul Chemical Industries (supra) the Court upheld the injunction granted as against the defendants from using the mark “Simatul” or any other word resembling the word “Cibatul” as comprised in the plaintiff’s name and style. The defendants explained the adoption of the mark “Simatul” as being derived from the co-promotors daughters name ‘Sima’ and sons name ‘Atul’ and also from the first two letters of the Managing Directors grandfather ‘Shivdas’. The Court rejected this explanation as follows: “To us it appears that it is a very laboured and naïve attempt to explain why the name ‘Simatul’ has been invented. At first an attempt was made to explain merely the word ‘Sima’ and then when it was realized that an explanation was also necessary for the last four letters which contained identical name ‘Atul’ used by the plaintiff-Company a fresh explanation FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES52 (Feb.) 2017 was invented we are not prepared to accept this facile explanation too readily. It appears that it has been done deliberately and purposefully with a view to invent a name similar to the name of the plaintiff- Company. We are not prepared to accept the innocent and innocuous-looking facial make-up which is too naïve to carry conviction..........” 72. In Rolex SA v. Alex Jewellery Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (supra) the defendant claimed to have adopted the mark ROLEX for jewellery after the name of his son Alex and for the reason of his business of rolled gold jewellery. The Court rejected this explanation, and observed that: “Though the defendant No. 1 has furnished an explanation for adopting the name/mark ROLEX in relation to its artificial jewellery but the same is not found convincing by me. The defendant No. 1 being a manufacturer in Bombay, having sales of jewellery in Delhi as well and stated to be enjoying a huge reputation, as argued on the basis of the three affidavits filed by the defendant No. 1 is bound to have known in 1993 and/or 1995 when it claims to have adopted the mark ROLEX, of the plaintiff. The defendant No. 1 admits it is not a dictionary word. I am not convinced even prima facie that owing to the name of the son of the Director of the defendant No. 1 being Alex and further owing to the business of being rolled gold, the name ROLEX was coined by the defendant.” 73. As regards the explanation furnished by the defendants to the adoption of their mark, I may also refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court case of M/s. Satyam Infoway v. M/s Sifynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (supra), wherein the defendants (respondents) were using www.siffynet.net, whereas the plaintiffs had registered the domain names www.sifynet.com, www.sifymall.com, etc. The defendants stated that the term ‘Siffy’ was invented by them from the first five letters of promoters of the company. The Court rejected this argument in Para 30, and observed as follows: “.....the list of the names provided by the respondent to support its case that ‘Siffy’ as an original acronym was based on the initial letters of the respondent- company’s promoters seems unsupported by any evidence whatsoever. No document apart from a bare assertion that the five named individuals had any special collective role in the organization or promo- tion of the business has been filed. The appellant’s internet based business was, from 1999, high profile. The evident media prominence to ‘SIFY’ and large subscriber base could have left the respondent in no doubt as to its successful existence prior to the adoption of Siffy as part of its corporate name and registration of Siffynet and Siffy.com as its domain names. It would therefore appear that the justification followed the choice and that the respondent’s choice of the word “Siffy” was not original but inspired by the appellant’s business name and that the respondent’s explanation for its choice of the word “Siffy” as a corporate and domain name is an invented post-rationalisation.” Similarly, in the present case, adoption of the word ‘ZIFFI’ as a derivative of the word ‘Jiffy’ by the defendants to signify the quick and speedy nature of their service appears to be devised. There is no justification for change in spelling from “Jiffy” Vol. CCXXXVII 53 to “ZIFFI”. It is also pertinent to mention that the plaintiff’s adoption of the term ‘ZIFI’ was much prior to that of the defendants, and a change in the services/goods will not make a difference in establishing honest adoption of the mark by the defendant. 74. The defendants are maintaining a website and a mobile application under the impugned mark and generating revenue out of the same and thereby taking unfair advantage of the registered mark of the plaintiff. The defendants have exploited the mark commercially. Such conduct of the defendants, and the high degree of similarity in both the marks is likely to dilute the distinctive character and reputation of the plaintiffs’ trademark. In light of the above, I am of the view that the essential ingredients of Section 29(4) have also been squarely met and, prima facie, satisfied in the present case. 75. I shall now deal with defendants’ submission premised on Section 34 of the Act. Section 34 serves as an exception to Section 29, if the offending mark is in continuous use prior to the first use of the registered trademark or from its date of registration. The Section reads as under: “34. Saving for vested rights.— Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of registered trade mark to interfere with or restrain the use by any person of a trade mark identical with or nearly resembling it in relation to goods or services in relation to which that person or a predecessor in title of his has continuously used that trade mark from a date prior— (a) to the use of the first-mentioned trade mark in relation to those goods or services be the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his; or (b) to the date of registration of the first-mentioned trade mark in respect of those goods or services in the name of the proprietor of a predecessor in title of his; whichever is the earlier, and the Registrar shall not refuse (on such use being proved), to register the second mentioned trade mark by reason only of the registration of the first mentioned trade mark.” (Emphasis supplied) The defendants allege that they are prior users of the mark ‘ZIFFI’ for booking of appointments of doctors, diagnostics, spas etc and that Section 34 has to be interpreted in relation to the goods or services of the defendants. If it were so, it would permit a person to dishonestly adopt a mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to a prior registered trademark (well known or not) but being used for goods or services which are different to that of the prior trademark. Such an interpretation would be in the teeth of Section 29 of the Act. Priority has to be viewed in relation to the use of the mark, and not the goods or services for which the mark is used. I, therefore, find no merit in the defendants’ interpretation of Section 34 of the Act. 76. To address the submission of the defendants on delay in filing of the suit by the plaintiff after the expiry of the caveats filed by the defendants, I refer to the decision in the following cases: FDC LTD. v. DOCSUGGEST HEALTHCARE SERVICES P. LTD. DELHI LAW TIMES54 (Feb.) 2017 M/s Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s India Stationary Products Co. and Another, 38 (1989) DLT 54=AIR 1990 DELHI 19: The learned Single Judge in para 39 ruled that “Any growth after notice is at the risk and peril of the defendant. The defendant certainly had notice of application of the plaintiff having been filed against it in the year 1985 for cancellation of registration of the copyright. The defendant should have been warned, at that stage, that the plaintiff is not likely to accept the user of its mark by the defendant. If the defendant continued to do business by using the im- pugned mark, it did so at its own peril. The continued user cannot be set up as a defence under these circumstances.” Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. v. Reddy Pharmaceuticals Limited: the Court held that “...the owners of trade marks or copyrights are not expected to run after every infringer and thereby remain involved in litigation at the cost of their business time. If the impugned infringement is too trivial or insignificant and is not capable of harming their business interests, they may overlook and ignore petty violations till they assume alarming proportions.” Thus, the defendants were already aware of plaintiff’s business when they received a cease and desist notice from it in October, 2014. Filing of an infringement suit after six months by the plaintiff does not amount to any significant delay, and cannot be said to be an approach to the Court with unclean hands since the defendants were already put on notice of plaintiff’s grievance. 77. The plaintiff has also made out a prima facie case of passing-off as against the defendants. The test as laid down on deciding the question of deceptive similarity in a passing off action as provided in Cadila Healthcare Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) have been squarely met. As aforementioned and discussed, plaintiff has, prima facie, inter alia been able to establish that the nature of marks, nature of goods and services, class of purchasers/ consumers are similar; there is a high degree of resemblance between the marks, and also that there exists a likelihood of confusion and association because of the similarity between the marks and goods/services. 78. Thus, I am of the prima facie view that the use of the mark “ZIFFI” by the defendants in respect of their services is infringing the trademark of the plaintiff “ZIFI” used in respect of its pharmaceuticals preparations and it also tantamounts to passing off its business, website and services as that of the plaintiff. I am also convinced that the balance of convenience lies in favour of the plaintiff and not the defendants owing to their goodwill, reputation and growing business. Further, irreparable loss and injury would be suffered by the plaintiff, if the ad interim injunction is not granted. 79. For the aforesaid reasons, I allow I.A. No.6690/2015 and dismiss I.A. No. 3733/2016. The ex parte ad interim order of injunction passed by the learned Single Judge on 6.4.2015 is restored and shall continue to operate till the disposal of the suit. The defendant is also directed to place on record its sales and profit figures for the period that it has used the mark “ZIFFI” in respect of its business till date. The same — duly certified by its Chartered Accountant, be filed within two months. The plaintiff shall be entitled to costs in these applications quantified at Rs. 1 lakh. Vol. CCXXXVII 55 80. Any observations made in this order are only tentative and not final and shall not affect the final determination of the suit. IA 6690/2015 allowed. 237 (2017) DELHI LAW TIMES 55 DELHI HIGH COURT Valmiki J. Mehta, J. MANAGING COMMITTEE OF RANI DUTTA ARYA VIDYALAYA & ANR. —Petitioners versus DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION, GOVT.
