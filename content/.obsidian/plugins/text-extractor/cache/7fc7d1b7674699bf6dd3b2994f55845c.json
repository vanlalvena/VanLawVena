The Chief Agricultural Officer, Kapurthala filed a criminal com plaint being CC.

The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, following the · decision of the Gujarat High Court in St'ate ,of Gujarat v, Agro- Chem/cals e!c,,(1) discharged the respondent and dropped the, procee- dings against him,., The State of Punjab preferred Criminal Revision Application No, 48 of 1981 in the Court C!f the learned Additional Sessfons Judge, Kapurfhala who by his judgment,and order dated February 13, 1982 set aside the order of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate holding that in view of the provisions contained'in Section 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court of ihe Chief Judiclal Magistrate, Kapurthala had jurisdiction to try the respon· de,nt along with the other co-accused.

Hence this appeal by special leave. · The allegation against the resportdent was that he manufac- tured sub,standard fertiliser and. through his marketing agents M/s Sachdeva Enterprises, Kapurthala marketed the same. The offence was discl.osed when the Fertiliser ll}spector took a sample of the sul:J- standard fertiliser from the marketing agents at Kapurthala. It is an admitted position · 1#,at the respondent who 'is the manufacturer · carries on-his bussiness of manufactuiing fertilisers at Ludhiana. Th~ question· posed is : • whether the Court of Chief Judicia!

The learned Single Judge of the ·High Court following the deeision in Satinder Singh's case held ihat the .1nanufacturer•of sub\"standard fertiliser cannot be tried where the commodity was being marketed The view taken l:\\y the High Court with. respect is wholly ·untenable in law. But before examining the legal position .··. subsequent dev~lopn1ertt of law in the sa1ue High Cou'rt on this very point may be .noticed. · To begin with, let it be pointed out that the decision.agai~st which the present appeal is being heard was quoted bef<;>re another . . learned ·Single Judgv of the same High Court and as the.learned Sin°gle Judge had grave doubt abo:J.tthe correctness of the -view taken. by the learned.Judge in this case, he referred the matter for ay.thori, ·tative pronouncement. to a larger bench ofthe same High Court.

' ... ) ) . t PUNJAB v; NOHAR CIIAND (Desai, J.) 843 bench of the High Court has disapproved the view taken by the A learhed Judge in this case. The respondent, the manufacturer of the sub-standard fertiliser is. to be tried alongwith those who marketed the sub-standard fertiliser manufactured by him as his agents. The question iS whether .B the court where the sub-standard fertiliser i) marketed would have jurisdiction to try the manufacturer of. the sub-standard fertiliser whose. manufacturing activity is at a different pla~e. This very . argument was posed before the Division Bench ot the High Court. The High Court after referring to Secti.ons 179 and 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 held that the court where sub-sta.ndard · C fe~iliser was found to be marketed wili have the jurisdiption to try the manufacturer of sub-standard fertiliser even if the manufacturing activity is at an entirely different place. The Division Bench held that the manufacturer ·as well as. the dealer can be tried· at .a plac.e where the consequences .of the manufacturing and selling of sub· standard fertiliser had ensue·d as envisaged in Sections 179 and 180 ·.o of the Code of C~iminal Procedure. That in our opinion (appears to be the correct view in law. ' Section 179 prnvides that when an act is an offence; by reason of anything which has been <jone and of a consequence which has E ensued, the offence may be inquired into or tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction· such thing bas been done 'or ·such conse· quence has ensued. Section 180 provides .that where irn act is an offence by reason of its relation to any other act which is also an offence or which wot\\ld be an offence if the doer were capable . of committing· an offence, the first-mentioned offence may be inquired \" F into or tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction either act was done . . . . . Now if manufacturing sub-standard fertiliser is by itself an ·offence and marketing the sub-standard fertiliser is ·itself a distinct offence but they are so-inter-connected as cause and eff;ct, .both can be tried at one or the other place. If one manu.factures the sub- standard fertiliser, wherever it is marketed the inter-relation or casual connection is of cause. and effect.· The situation will be adequately covered by Secs. 179 and 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We are in agreement with the later decision of Jhe Division Bench rendered on March 9, 1983 that the court where the sub-standard fertiliser is being marketed will ~qually have the • G H • J 844 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1984) 3 S.C.R. A jurisdicil0n to try the manufacturer of sub-standard fertiliser. 1 his is so obvious that any further discussion appears to us to t>e superfluous. B ,C D E G. H • Mr. Frank Amhouy, learned counsel who appeared for the· respondent urged that the concurring decision of Alagiriswami, J. in Bhagwandas Jagdish Chander v. Delhi Administration( I) would clearly show that the manuiacture of an adulterated article of food and selling the same c,annot be said to be part· and parcel of the same transaction and that unless therefore the complaint shows that the sample of fe.rtiliser was taken from a bag of fertiliser as delivered by the manufacturer, it is. distinctly possible that adulteration may have taken. place on a subsequent occasion and therefore one cannot infer . . ~ ' manufacture of sub-standard fertiliser from it being so marketed when the sample was taken from the marketing agency. This approach overlooks the fact that the trial is yet to be held. One can envisage two situations. When a sample of fertiliser is taken from a bag which was in the same condition as delivered by the manufac- turer and it was in possession of a marketing agent manufacture and sale of sub-standard fertiliser would constitute. indisputably one . transaction. But this is predicated upon the facts which may be disclosed in the trial and proved. In Bhag~andas Jagdish (:hander's case, the allegation was that the appellant before the court sold ghee to a v~ndor which was on analysis · found io be adulterated ahd both were jointly tried under ~ection 7 read with Sec. 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. In the course of trial, the purchaser of ghee wanted warrantor to be discharged so that he · can be examined as a defence witness to prove his own purchase of the offending article. This application was granted and the warrantor· was acquitted. After the acquittal of the warrantor, the learned Magistrate impleaded the manufacturer Mr. Gauri Shanker Prem Narain .under section 20-A of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. An appeal was preferred by the· Municipal Corporation ' ~ of Delhi against the \":cquittal of the warrantor and the other accused. The High Court maintained the acquittal of Lakshmi Narain but set aside the acq~itial of warrantor. That i.s how the matter came up to this Court.· We fail to see how this decision· can at all help the respondent in this' case. However, reliance was placed· on one observation in the' concurring judgment of Alagiriswami, J. which reads as under : (!) (1975) Suppl. SCR 30 • • i.,. t ' ' - ' !! \\ _l,. ~ ; I • PUNJAB v. NOHAR CHAND (Desai, J.) \"It would b.e noticed that while the charge states that . the sample of ghee purchased from Lakshmi Narain was found to be adulterated, there i_s no allegation that the ghee sold by the appellant to Lakshmi Narain was adulterated. While it may be readily conceded that the common object or common intention or unity of purpose. between the · manufacturer, the distributor and the vendor was tq sell the article of fMd sold, it is not said that 1t was to sell the adulteraiedi>rticle of foo.d.\" At a later stage, it is observed that 'the validity of th~ charge has (o be decided oo the facts put forward as the prosecution case. If' it is not established against anyone of them that, the article ·of food manufactured, distributed or sold by him was adulterated that person will be acquitted, not because the charge was not valid or was defective but because there was no proof to substantiate the. charge. But without that allegation there canuot be said t.o be ·a unity of purpose or common object or common intention on the part of all of them who manufactur~, distribute or sell the adulterated food.' It was further observed that \"the manufacture, distribution and sale Of adulterated ghee would be the same transaciion if it was found to be adulterated at all the three stages. Otherwise it only means that they were all same transaction only in the sense that the common object of all ofthem is the selling of the ghee.'' How the extracted_ observa- tion in any way helps the respondent passes comprehension. Firstly, the question of jurisdiction of the court trying the offender was never raised in that case. l}nd,here the respondent was discharged pn the ground of want of jurisdiction. Secondly, the decision proceeded on the facts of the case as would be evident. from the . extracted passage which recites the charge. That aspect does not fii:ure in this case. Let it be made clear that no affidavit was filed on • behalf of the respondent in this Court, nor the complaint was read over to us. And the case proceeds on ~he averments not presently disputed. · Therefore in this case we are left·with the allegations as found in the judgment of the High Court and the learned Additional Sessions Judge and it clearly establishes that where the . marketing. agent of the manufacturer of· fertiliser which is found to be sub· standard is being prosocuted for marketing sub-standard fertiliser . . . ' the manufacturec can be tried with him and the court where the sub· ·standard fetiliser was marketed will have jurisdiction to try them both. · ... 845 B c D E F G H 846 B J .
