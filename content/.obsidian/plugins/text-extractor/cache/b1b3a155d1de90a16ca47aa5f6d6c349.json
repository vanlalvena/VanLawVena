STATE OF HARYANA 657 and registered as required by law, no right, title or interest in an immovable property can be transferred. (Para 18) Any contract of sale (agreement to sell) which is not a registered deed of conveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of the requirements of Sections 54 and 55 of the TP Act and will not confer any title nor transfer any interest in an immovable property (except to the limited right granted under Section 53-A of the TP Act). According to the TP Act, an agreement for sale, whether with possession or without possession, is not a conveyance. (Paras 19, 16 and 24) Narandas Karsondas v. S.A Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247; Rambhau Namdeo Gajre v. Narayan Bapuji Dhotra, (2004) 8 SCC 614, relied on Ram Baran Prasad v. Ram Mohit Hazra, AIR 1967 SC 744: (1967) 1 SCR 293, cited A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property. The power of attorney is creation of an agency whereby the grantor authorises the grantee to do the acts specified therein, on behalf of grantor, which when executed will be binding on the grantor as if done by him (Section 1-A and Section 2, Powers of Attorney Act, 1882). It is revocable or terminable at any time unless it is made irrevocable in a manner known to law. Even an irrevocable attorney does not have the effect of transferring title to the grantee. (Para 20) An attorney-holder may however execute a deed of conveyance in exercise of the power granted under the power of attorney and convey title on behalf of the grantor. (Para 21) State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata, (2005) 12 SCC 77, relied on A will is the testament of the testator. It is a posthumous disposition of the estate of the testator directing distribution of his estate upon his death. It is not a transfer inter vivos. The two essential characteristics of a will are that it is intended to come into effect only after the death of the testator and is revocable at any time during the lifetime of the testator. It is said that so long as the testator is alive, a will is not worth the paper on which it is written, as the testator can at any time revoke it. If the testator, who is not married, marries after making the will, by operation of law, the will stands revoked. (Sections 69 and 70, Succession Act, 1925.) Registration of a will does not make it any more effective [while the testator is alive]. (Para 22) Therefore, an SA/GPA/will transaction [while the testator is alive] does not convey any title nor creates any interest in an immovable property. The observations by the Delhi High Court in Asha M. Jain case, (2001) 94 DLT 841 that the \"concept of power-of-attorney sales has been recognised as a mode of transaction\" when dealing with transactions by way of SA/GPA/will are unwarranted and not justified. (Para 23) Asha M. Jain v. Canara Bank, (2001) 94 DLT 841, overruled on this point The courts will not treat transactions of the nature of \"GPA sales\" or \"SA/GPA/will transfers\" as completed or concluded transfers or as conveyances as they neither convey title nor create any interest in an immovable property. They cannot be recognised as deeds of title, except to the limited extent of Section 53-A of the TP Act. Such transactions cannot be relied upon or made the basis for mutations in municipal or revenue records. The view taken herein will apply not only to deeds of conveyance in regard to freehold property but also to transfer of leasehold property.

It is time that an end is put to the pernicious practice of SA/GPA/will transactions known as GPA sales. (Paras 24 , 23 and 26) However , the SA/GPA/will transactions can continue to be treated as existing agreements of sale. Nothing prevents the affected parties from getting regi stered deeds of conveyance to complete their title. The said \"SA/GPA/will transaction s\" may also be used to obtain specific performance or to defend po ssession under Section 53-A of the TP Act. If they are entered before the present day, they may be relied upon to apply for regularisation of allotments/ leases by development authoritie s. Moreover, if the documents relating to \"SA/GPA/will transactions \" have been accepted/acted upon by DDA or other development authorities or by the municipal or Revenue Authorities to effect mutation , they need not be disturbed , merely on account of the present decision . (Paras 26 and 24) The observations made herein are not intended to in any way affect the validity of sale agreements and powers of attorney executed in genuine transactions. For example , a person may give a power of attorney to his spouse, son, daughter, brother, sister or a relative to manage his affairs or to execute a deed of conveyance. A person may enter into a development agreement with a land developer or builder for developing the land either by forming plots or by constructing apartment buildings and in that behalf execute an agreement of sale and grant a power of attorney empowering the developer to execute agreements of sale or conveyances in regard to individual plots of land or undivided shares in the land relating to apartments in favour of prospective purchasers. In several States, the execution of such development agreements and powers of attorney are already regulated by law and subjected to specific stamp duty.

RAVEENDRAN, J.- By an earlier order dated 15-5-2009 in Sura} Lamp & Industries (P) Ltd. (1) v. State of Haryana 1, we had referred to the ill-effects of what is known as general power of attorney sales (for short \"GPA sales\") or sale agreement/general power of attorney/will transfers (for short \"SA/GPA/will transfers\"). Both the descriptions are misnomers as there cannot be a sale by execution of a power of attorney nor can there be a transfer by execution of an agreement of sale and a power of attorney and will. As noticed in the earlier order, these kinds of transactions were evolved to avoid prohibitions/conditions regarding certain transfers, to avoid payment of stamp duty and registration charges on deeds of conveyance, to avoid payment of capital gains on transfers, to invest unaccounted for money (black money) and to avoid payment of \"unearned increases\" due to development authorities, on transfer. 2. The modus operandi in such SA/GPA/will transactions is for the vendor or person claiming to be the owner to receive the agreed consideration, deliver possession of the property to the purchaser and execute the following documents or variations thereof: (a) An agreement of sale by the vendor in favour of the purchaser confirming the terms of sale, delivery of possession and payment of full consideration and undertaking to execute any document as and when required in future. or An agreement of sale agreeing to sell the property, with a separate affidavit confirming receipt of full price and delivery of possession and undertaking to execute the sale deed whenever required. (b) An irrevocable general power of attorney by the vendor in favour of the purchaser or his nominee authorising him to manage, deal with and dispose of the property without reference to the vendor. or A general power of attorney by the vendor in favour of the purchaser or his nominee authorising the attorney-holder to sell or transfer the h property and a special power of attorney to manage the property. 1 (2009) 7 sec 363 : (2009) 3 sec (Civ) 126 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

These transactions are not to be confused or equated with genuine transactions where the owner of a property grants a power of attorney in favour of a family member or friend to manage or sell his property, as he is not able to manage the property or execute the sale, personally. These are transactions, where a purchaser pays the full price, but instead of getting a deed of conveyance gets an SA/GPA/will as a mode of transfer, either at the instance of the vendor or at his own instance. b Ill-effects of SAJGPA/will transactions 4. The earlier order dated 15-5-2009 1, noted the ill-effects of such SA/GPA/will transactions (that is, generation of black money, growth of land mafia and criminalisation of civil disputes) as under: (SCC pp. 368-69, paras 19-21) \"19. Recourse to 'SA/GPA/will' transactions is taken in regard to freehold properties, even when there is no bar or prohibition regarding transfer or conveyance of such property, by the following categories of persons: C (a) Vendors with imperfect title who cannot or do not want to d execute registered deeds of conveyance. (b) Purchasers who want to invest undisclosed wealth/income in immovable properties without any public record of the transactions. The process enables them to hold any number of properties without disclosing them as assets held. (c) Purchasers who want to avoid the payment of stamp duty and e registration charges either deliberately or on wrong advice. Persons who deal in real estate resort to these methods to avoid multiple stamp duties/registration fees so as to increase their profit margin. 20. Whatever be the intention, the consequences of SA/GPA/will transactions are disturbing and far-reaching, adversely affecting the f economy, civil society and law and order. Firstly, it enables large-scale evasion of income tax, wealth tax, stamp duty and registration fees thereby denying the benefit of such revenue to the Government and the public. Secondly, such transactions enable persons with undisclosed wealth/income to invest their black money and also earn profit/income, thereby encouraging circulation of black money and corruption. g 21. This kind of transactions have disastrous collateral effects also. For example, when the market value increases, many vendors (who effected power of attorney sales without registration) are tempted to resell the property taking advantage of the fact that there is no registered instrument or record in any public office thereby cheating the purchaser. When the purchaser under such 'power-of-attorney sales' comes to know about the vendor's action, he invariably tries to take the help of h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On the other hand, real estate mafia many a time purchase properties which are already subject to power-of-attorney sale and then threaten the previous 'power-of-attorney sale' purchasers from asserting their rights. Either way, such power-of-attorney sales indirectly lead to growth of real estate mafia and criminalisation of real estate transactions.\" It also makes title verification and certification of title, which is an integral part of orderly conduct of transactions relating to immovable property, difficult, if not impossible, giving nightmares to bona fide purchasers wanting to own a property with an assurance of good and marketable title. 5. This Court had, therefore, requested the learned Solicitor General to give suggestions on behalf of the Union of India . This Court also directed notice to the States of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to give their views on the matter. The four States have responded and confirmed that SA/GPA/will transfers required to be discouraged as they lead to loss of revenue (stamp duty) and increase in litigations due to defective title. They also ref erred to some measures taken in that behalf. The measures differ from State to State. In general, the measures are: (i) to amend the Registration Act, 1908 by Amendment Act 48 of 2001 with effect from 24-9-2001 requiring documents containing contract to transfer for consideration (agreements of sale, etc .) relating to any immovable property for the purpose of Section 53-A of the Act, shall be registered; and (ii) to amend the stamp laws subjecting agreements of sale with delivery of possession and/or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of non-family members authorising sale, to the same stamp duty as deed of conveyance. 6. These measures, no doubt, to some extent plugged the loss of revenue by way of stamp duty on account of parties having recourse to SA/GPA/will transactions, instead of executing deeds of conveyance. But the other ill-effects continued. Further, such transactions which were only prevalent in Delhi and the surrounding areas have started spreading to other States also. Those with ulterior motives either to indulge in black money transactions or land mafia continue to favour such transactions. There are also efforts to thwart the amended provisions by not referring to delivery of possession in the agreement of sale and giving a separate possession receipt or an affidavit confirming delivery of possession and thereby avoiding the registration and stamp duty. The amendments to stamp and registration laws do not address the larger issue of generation of black money and operation of land mafia. The four States and the Union of India are however unanimous that SA/GPA/will transactions should be curbed and expressed their willingness to take remedial steps. 7. The State of Haryana has however taken a further positive step by reducing the stamp duty on deeds of conveyance from 12 .5% to 5%. A high rate of stamp duty acts as a damper for execution of deeds of conveyance for full value, and encourages SA/GPA/will transfers. When parties resort to SA/GPA/will transfers, the adverse effect is not only loss of revenue (stamp ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 662 SUPREME COURT CASES c2012) 1 sec duty and registration charges) but the greater danger of generation of \"black\" money. Reducing the stamp duty on conveyance to realistic levels will encourage the public to disclose the maximum sale value and have the sale a deeds registered. Though the reduction of the stamp duty, may result in an immediate reduction in the revenue by way of stamp duty, in the long run it will be advantageous for two reasons: (i) parties will be encouraged to execute registered deeds of conveyance/sale deeds without any undervaluation, instead of entering into SA/GPA/will transactions; and (ii) more and more sale transactions will be done by way of duly registered sale b deeds, disclosing the entire sale consideration thereby reducing the generation of black money to a large extent. 8. When high stamp duty is prevalent, there is a tendency to undervalue documents, even where sale deeds are executed. When properties are undervalued, a large part of the sale price changes hand by way of cash thereby generating \"black\" money. Even when the State Governments take c action to prevent undervaluation, it only results in the recovery of deficit stamp duty and registration charges with reference to the market value, but the actual sale consideration remains unaltered. If a property worth 5 millions is sold for 2 millions, the undervaluation rules may enable the State Government to initiate proceedings so as to ensure that the deficit stamp duty and registration charges are recovered in respect of the difference of 3 d millions. But the sale price remains 2 millions and the black money of 3 millions generated by the undervalued sale transaction, remains undisturbed. 9. In this background, we will examine the validity and legality of SA/GPA/will transactions. We have heard learned Mr Gopal Subramanium, amicus curiae and noted the views of the Government of NCT of Delhi, Government of Haryana, Government of Punjab and Government of Uttar e Pradesh who have filed their submissions in the form of affidavits. Relevant legal provisions 10. Section 5 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (\"the TP Act\", for short) defines \"transfer of property\" as under: \"5. 'Transfer of property' defined.-In the following sections 'transfer f of property' means an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself or to himself and one or more other living persons and 'to transfer property' is to perform such act.\" 11. Section 54 of the TP Act defines \"sales\" thus: \"54. 'Sale' defined.-'Sale' is a transfer of ownership in exchange for a g price paid or promised or part-paid and part-promised. Sale how made.-Such transfer, in the case of tangible immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards , or in the case of a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument.

We may next refer to the relevant provisions of the Stamp Act, 1899*. Section 27 of the Stamp Act, 1899 casts upon the party, liable to pay stamp duty, an obligation to set forth in the instrument all facts and circumstances which affect the chargeability of duty on that instrument. Section 23 prescribes stamp duty on \"conveyance\". In many States appropriate amendments have been made whereby agreements of sale acknowledging delivery of possession or power of attorney authorising the attorney to \"sell any immovable property\" are charged with the same duty as leviable on conveyance. 14. Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 makes a deed of conveyance compulsorily registerable. We extract below the relevant portions of Section 17: \"17.

In the earlier order dated 15-5-2009 1, the objects and benefits of registration were explained and we extract them for ready reference: (SCC p . 367, paras 15-18) \"15. The Registration Act, 1908 was enacted with the intention of C providing orderliness, discipline and public notice in regard to transactions relating to immovable property and protection from fraud and forgery of documents of transfer. This is achieved by requiring compulsory registration of certain types of documents and providing for consequences of non-registration. d 16. Section 17 of the Registration Act clearly provides that any document ( other than testamentary instruments) which purports or operates to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish whether in present or in future 'any right, title or interest' whether vested or contingent of the value of Rs 100 and upwards to or in immovable property. 17. Section 49 of the said Act provides that no document required by Section 17 to be registered shall, affect any immovable property comprised therein or received as evidence of any transaction affected such property, unless it has been registered. Registration of a document gives notice to the world that such a document has been executed. 18. Registration provides safety and security to transactions relating e to immovable property, even if the document is lost or destroyed. It gives publicity and public exposure to documents thereby preventing forgeries and frauds in regard to transactions and execution of documents. Registration provides information to people who may deal with a property , as to the nature and extent of the rights which persons may have, affecting that property.

It reduces disputes and litigations to a large extent. Scope of an agreement of sale 16. Section 54 of the TP Act makes it clear that a contract of sale, that is, an agreement of sale does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property. This Court in Narandas Karsondas v. S.A. Kamtam 2 observed: (SCC pp. 254-55, paras 32-33 & 37) \"32. A contract of sale does not of itself create any interest in, or c charge on, the property. This is expressly declared in Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act. (See Ram Baran Prasad v. Ram Mohit Hazra 3.) The fiduciary character of the personal obligation created by a contract for sale is recognised in Section 3 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, and in Section 91 of the Trusts Act. The personal obligation created by a contract of sale is described in Section 40 of the Transfer of Property Act d as an obligation arising out of contract and annexed to the ownership of property, but not amounting to an interest or easement therein . e f g h 33. In India, the word 'transfer' is defined with reference to the word 'convey' .... The word 'conveys' in Section 5 of the Transfer of Property Act is used in the wider sense of conveying ownership. * * * 37 . ... that only on execution of conveyance, ownership passes from one party to another .... \" 17. In Rambhau Namdeo Gajre v. Narayan Bapuji Dhotra 4 this Court held: (SCC p. 619, para 10) \"JO. Protection provided under Section 53-A of the Act to the proposed transferee is a shield only against the transferor. It disentitles the transferor from disturbing the possession of the proposed transferee who is put in possession in pursuance to such an agreement. It has nothing to do with the ownership of the proposed transferor who remains full owner of the property till it is legally conveyed by executing a registered sale deed in favour of the transferee. Such a right to protect possession against the proposed vendor cannot be pressed into service against a third party.\" 18. It is thus clear that a transfer of immovable property by way of sale can only be by a deed of conveyance (sale deed).

Any contract of sale (agreement to sell) which is not a registered deed a of conveyance ( deed of sale) would fall short of the requirements of Sections 54 and 55 of the TP Act and will not confer any title nor transfer any interest in an immovable property ( except to the limited right granted under Section 53-A of the TP Act). According to the TP Act , an agreement of sale, whether with possession or without possession, is not a conveyance. Section 54 of the TP Act enacts that sale of immovable property can be made only by a b registered instrument and an agreement of sale does not create any interest or charge on its subject-matter. Scope of power of attorney 20. A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property. The power of attorney is c creation of an agency whereby the grantor authorises the grantee to do the acts specified therein, on behalf of grantor, which when executed will be binding on the grant or as if done by him ( see Section 1-A and Section 2 of the Powers of Attorney Act, 1882). It is revocable or terminable at any time unless it is made irrevocable in a manner known to law. Even an irrevocable attorney does not have the effect of transferring title to the grantee . d 21. In State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata 5 this Court held: (SCC pp. 90 & 101, paras 13 & 52) \"13. A grant of power of attorney is essentially governed by Chapter X of the Contract Act. By reason of a deed of power of attorney, an agent is formally appointed to act for the principal in one transaction or a series of transactions or to manage the affairs of the principal generally e conferring necessary authority upon another person. A deed of power of attorney is executed by the principal in favour of the agent. The agent derives a right to use his name and all acts, deeds and things done by him and subject to the limitations contained in the said deed, the same shall be read as if done by the donor. A power of attorney is, as is well known, a document of convenience. f * * * 52 . Execution of a power of attorney in terms of the provisions of the Contract Act as also the Powers of Attorney Act is valid. A power of attorney, we have noticed hereinbefore, is executed by the donor so as to enable the donee to act on his behalf. Except in cases where power of attorney is coupled with interest, it is revocable. The donee in exercise of g his power under such power of attorney only acts in place of the donor subject of course to the powers granted to him by reason thereof. He cannot use the power of attorney for his own benefit. He acts in a fiduciary capacity. Any act of infidelity or breach of trust is a matter between the donor and the donee.\" h s c20os) 12 sec 77 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

An attorney-holder may however execute a deed of conveyance in exercise of the power granted under the power of attorney and convey title on behalf of the grantor. Scope of will 22. A will is the testament of the testator. It is a posthumous disposition of the estate of the testator directing distribution of his estate upon his death. It is not a transfer inter vivos. The two essential characteristics of a will are that it is intended to come into effect only after the death of the testator and is revocable at any time during the lifetime of the testator. It is said that so long as the testator is alive , a will is not worth the paper on which it is written , as the testator can at any time revoke it. If the testator, who is not married, marries after making the will, by operation of law, the will stands revoked. (See Sections 69 and 70 of the Succession Act, 1925.) Registration of a will does not make it any more effective. Conclusion 23. Therefore, an SA/GPA/will transaction does not convey any title nor creates any interest in an immovable property. The observations by the Delhi High Court in Asha M. Jain v. Canara Bank6, that the \"concept of power-of- attorney sales has been recognised as a mode of transaction\" when dealing with transactions by way of SA/GPA/will are unwarranted and not justified, unintendedly misleading the general public into thinking that SA/GPA/will transactions are some kind of a recognised or accepted mode of transfer and that it can be a valid substitute for a sale deed. Such decisions to the extent they recognise or accept SA/GPA/will transactions as concluded transfers, as contrasted from an agreement to transfer, are not good law. 24. We therefore reiterate that immovable property can be legally and lawfully transferred/conveyed only by a registered deed of conveyance. Transactions of the nature of \"GPA sales\" or \"SA/GPA/will transfers\" do not convey title and do not amount to transfer, nor can they be recognised or valid mode of transfer of immovable property. The courts will not treat such transactions as completed or concluded transfers or as conveyances as they neither convey title nor create any interest in an immovable property. They cannot be recognised as deeds of title, except to the limited extent of Section 53-A of the TP Act. Such transactions cannot be relied upon or made the basis for mutations in municipal or revenue records. What is stated above will apply not only to deeds of conveyance in regard to freehold property but also to transfer of leasehold property. A lease can be validly transferred only under a registered assignment of lease. It is time that an end is put to the pernicious practice of SA/GPA/will transactions known as GPA sales. 25. It has been submitted that making declaration that GPA sales and SA/GPA/will transfers are not legally valid modes of transfer is likely to 6 (2001) 94 DLT 841 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It is also submitted that this a decision should be made applicable prospectively to avoid hardship. 26. We have merely drawn attention to and reiterated the well-settled legal position that SA/GPA/will transactions are not \"transfers\" or \" sales\" and that such transactions cannot be treated as completed transfers or conveyances. They can continue to be treated as existing agreements of sale. Nothing prevents the affected parties from getting registered deeds of b conveyance to complete their title. The said \"SA/GPA/will transactions\" may also be used to obtain specific performance or to defend possession under Section 53-A of the TP Act. If they are entered before this day, they may be relied upon to apply for regularisation of allotments/leases by development authorities. We make it clear that if the documents relating to \"SA/GPA/will transactions\" have been accepted/acted upon by DDA or other developmental authorities or by the municipal or Revenue Authorities to effect mutation, they need not be disturbed, merely on account of this decision. C 27. We make it clear that our observations are not intended to in any way affect the validity of sale agreements and powers of attorney executed in genuine transactions. For example, a person may give a power of attorney to d his spouse, son, daughter, brother, sister or a relative to manage his affairs or to execute a deed of conveyance. A person may enter into a development agreement with a land developer or builder for developing the land either by forming plots or by constructing apartment buildings and in that behalf execute an agreement of sale and grant a power of attorney empowering the developer to execute agreements of sale or conveyances in regard to e individual plots of land or undivided shares in the land relating to apartments in favour of prospective purchasers. In several States, the execution of such development agreements and powers of attorney are already regulated by law and subjected to specific stamp duty . Our observations regarding \"SA/GPA/will transactions\" are not intended to apply to such bona fide/genuine transactions. f 28. We place on record our appreciation for the assistance rendered by Mr Gopal Subramanium , Senior Counsel, initially as Solicitor General and later as amicus curiae. 29. As the issue relating to validity of SA/GPA/will has been dealt with by this order, what remains is the consideration of the special leave petition g on its merits.
