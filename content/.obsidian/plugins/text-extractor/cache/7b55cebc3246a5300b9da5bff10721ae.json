Moti Ram Deka was a peon employed by the North East Fron- tier Railway and Sudhir Kumar Das was a confirmed clerk. The General Manager, North East Frontier Railway, terminated their services under R. 148(3) oflndian Railway Establishment Code, Vol. I. They challenged the termination of their services but their writ petitions were rejected by the Assam High Court and they came to this court by special leave. Priya Gupta was an Assistant Electrical Foreman in the North Eastern Railway. His services were terminated under R. 148. His writ petition and Letters Patent Appeal challenging termination of his services having been rejected by Allahabad High Court, he came to this Court by special leave . Tirath Ram Lakhanpal was a Guard employed by the Northern Railway. His services were terminated under R. 148. His writ petition and Letters Patent Appeal were dismissed by Punjab High Court and he came to this court by special leave. S.B. Tewari, Parimal Gupta and Prem Chand Thakur were employed in the North Eastern Frontier Railway. Their services were terminated under R. 149. Their writ petitions challenging termination of their services were accepted by the Assam High Court and Union of India came to this Court after getting a certi- ficate of fitness from the Assam High Court. The only question involved was the constitutional validity or otherwise of Rules 148(3) and 149(3) of the Indian Railway Establishment Code on the ground that they violated Arts. 14 and 311(2) of Constitution of India. Held: By majority by Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo, Hidaya- tullah, Ayyangar, Subba Rao and Das Gupta JJ.(Shah J. dissenting) 1963 December 5 1963 Moti Ram Deka 684 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] that Rules 148(3) and 149(3) of Indian Railway Establishment Code were invalid. Per Gajendragadkar, Wanchoo, Hidayatullah and Ayyangar, etc. JJ. v. Rules 148(3) and 149(3) are invalid inasmuch as they ate General inconsistent with the provisions of Arts. 311(2). The termination Manager, N.E.F. of the services of a permanent servant which is authorised by those Railways, rules, is no more and no less than his removal from service and Ma/igaon, hence Art. 311(2) must come into play in respect of such cases. Pandu, etc. The rule which does not require compliance with the procedure prescribed under Art. 311(2) must be struck down as invalid. A person who substantively holds a permanent post has a right to continue in service, subject to the rules of superannuation and compulsory retirement. If for any other reason that right is invaded and he is asked to leave his service, the termination of his service must inevitably mean the defeat of·his right to continue in service and as such it is in the nature of a penalty and amounts to removal. In other words, termination of the services of a permanent servant otherwise than on ground of superannuation or compulsory retirement, must per se amount to his removal and if by R. 148(3) or R. 149(3), such a termination is brought about, the rule clearly contravenes Art. 311(2) and must be held to be invalid.' Rules 148(3) and 149(3) contravene Art. 14 of the Constitu- tion. It is difficult to understand on what ground employment by the Railways alone can be said to constitute a class by itself for the purposes of framing the impugned rules. If considerations of administrative efficiency or exigencies of service justify the making of such a rule, such rules should have been framed in other depart- ments also. The pleasure of the President has lost some of its majesty and power as it is controlled by the provisions of Art. 311. Rules of superannuation are based on considerations of life expectation, mental capacity of civil servants having regard to climatic conditions under which they work and the nature of the work they do. They are not fixed on any ad hoc basis and do not involve the exercise of any discretion. They apply uniformly to all public servants falling under the category in respect of which they are framed. There can be no analogy between the rule of superannuation and rules 148(3) and 149(3) of the Code. If any rule permits the appropriate authority to retire compul- sorily a civil servant without imposing a limitation in that behalf that such civil servant should have put in a minimum period of service, that rule would be invalid and the so-called retirement ordered under the said rule would amount to removal of the civil servant within the meaning of Art. 311(2). r I • -• - . 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURTREPORTS 685 Where a rule is alleged to violate the constitutional guarantee afforded by Art. 311 (2), the argument of contract between the parties 1963 and its binding character is wholly inappropriate. Moti Ram Deka Per Subba Rao, J.-Rules 148(3) and 149(3) which confer a etc. power on the appointing authority to remove a permanent servant v. on notice, infringe the constitutional protection guaranteed to General a Government servant under Arts. 14 and 311 ofthe Constitution. A permanent post and rules such as 148(3) and 149(3) cannot Manager, N.E.F. stand together and the latter must inevitably yield to the former. Railways, It is neither the phraseology nor the nomenclature given to the act of termination of service that is material but the legal effect of the action taken that is decisive in considering the question whether a Government servant is dismissed or not. Whetherthe servi- ces of a permanent Government servant are terminated by giving him 15 day's notice or whether his services are dispensed with before the age of superannuation by way of compulsory retirement under or outside a rule of compulsory retirement, the termination deprives him of his title to the permanent post. If in the former case it amounts to dismissal, in the latter case, it must be equally so. In both cases, Art. 311 (2) is attracted. Compulsory retirement before age of superannuation is not an incident of tenure. It does not work automatically. It is not conceived in the interest of the employee. It is a mode of terminating his employment at the discretion of the appointing authority. As a matter of fact, whatever the language used in that connection, it is a punishment imposed on him. It not only destroys his title but also inevitably carries with it a stigma and hence such a termination is dismissal or removal within the meatting of Art. 311. A title to an office must be distinguished from the mode of its termination. If a person has title to an office, he will continue to have it till he is dismissed or removed from there. Terms of statutory ruJe9 may provide for conferment of a title to an office and also for the mode of protecting it. If under such rules, a person acquires title to an office, whatever mode of termination is prescri- bed and whatever phraseology is used to describe it, the termination is neither more nor less than a dismissal or removal from service and that inevitably attracts the provisions of Art. 311 of the Constitution. The argument that the mode of termination prescri- bed derogates from the title that otherwise would have been conferred on the employee mixes up two clear concepts of conferment of title and the mode of its deprivation. Article 311 is a constitutional protection given to Government servants, who have title to office, against their arbitrary and summary dismissal. Government cannot by rule evade the provisions of Art. 311. Parties also cannot contract themselves out of the constitutional provision. Per Das Gupta, J. Rule 148(3) does not contravene Art. 311(2). A railway servant to whom R. 148(3) applied has two Ma/igaon, Pandu, etc. 686 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] limitations put on his right to continue in service, viz., termination on attaining a certain age and termination of service on a notice Moti Ram Deka under R. 148(3). Where service is terminated by order of retire- etc men! under R. 2046, the termination is of a service where the 1963 · servant has no right to continue and it is not removal or dismissal. v. Likewise when service is terminated by notice under R. 148(3) General that termination is not removal or dismissal. Manager, N.E.F. Railways, Maligaon, Pandu, etc. The words 'removal' and 'dismissal' in Art. 311 mean and include only those terminations of service where a servant has acquired a right to continue in the post on the basis of terms and conditions of service and such other terminations where though there is no such right, the order has resulted in loss of accrued bene- fits. Terminations of service which do not satisfy either of these two tests do not come within any of these words. Both Arts. 309 and 310 are subject to Art. 311. If any rule is made under Art. 309 as regards conditions of service of a Govern- ment servant in the matter of his dismissal or removal or reduction in rank, it has to comply with the requirements of Art. 311. Before an order dismissing or removing or reducing a Government servant in rank is made by President or Governor in exercise of his pleasure, President or. Governor has to comply with the requirements of 311(2). Under Art. 310, all servants of the State hold office during the pleasure of the President or Governor as the case may be. That means that the officer has no right to be heard before his services are terminated. Article 311 provides an exception in the case of removal or dismissal. However, R. 148(3) contravenes Art. 14 as it does not give any guidance for exercise of discretion by the authority concerned and hence is invalid. Per Shah, J. Rules 148(3) and 149(3) do not infringe Art. 311(2) or Art. 14 of the Constitution. There is neither logic nor law in support of the contention that r. 148(3) contravenes Art. 311(2). The termination of employment under r. 148(3)doesnot involve the public servant concerned in loss of any rightwhichhe has already acquired. It does not amount to loss of a post to which he is entitled· under the terms of his employment because the right to a post is necessarily circumscribed by the conditions of employment which include r. 148(3). It also does not cast any stigma upon him. ' Mere determination of employment of a public servant, whether he is a temporary employee, a probationer, a contractual appointee or appointed substantively to hold a permanent post, will not attract the provisions of Art. 311(2) unless the determination is imposed as a matter of punishment. A railway servant who has accepted employment on the conditions contained in the rules, cannot after having obtained employment, claim that the conditions which were· offered to him and which he accepted, are not binding upon him. The sole exception to that rule is in cases where .the •. • ' f • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COlJRT REPORTS 687 condition prescribed by contract or statutory regulations is void as inconsistent with the constitutional safeguard. This exception 1963 is founded not on any right in the public servant to elect, but on the Mo ti Ram Deka invalidity of the covenant or regulation. There is no distinction etc between cases of termination of employment resulting from attaining · the age of superannuation or from orders of compulsory retirement, v · terminating temporary employment or employment on probation General and orders terminating employment after notice under R. 148(3). Manager, N.E.F. An appointment to a public post is always subject to the pleasure of the President, the exercise of such pleasure being restricted in the manner provided by the Constitution. A person appointed substantively to a post does not acquire a right to hold the post till he dies. He acquires merely a right to hold the post subject to the rules. If employment is validly termi- .. nated, the right to hold the post is determined even apart from the exercise of the pleasure of the President or the Governor. A public servant cannot claim to remain in office so long as he is of good behaviour. Such a concept of the tenure of a public servant's post is inconsistent with Arts. 309 and 310 of the Con- stitution. Rules 148(3) and 149(3) do not infringe Art. 14 of the Consti- tution. Art. 14 forbids class legislation but it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purpose of legislation. The special conditions in which the railways have to operate and the interests of the nation which they serve, justify the classification. If for the purpose of ensuring the interests and safety of the public and the State, the President has reserved to the Railway Administra- tion power to terminate employment under the Railways, it cannot be assumed that such vesting of authority singles out the railway servants for a special or discriminatory treatment 'so as to expose the rule which authorises termination of employment to the lia- bility to be struck off as infringing Art. 14. It is true that R. 148(3) does not expressly provide for guidance to the authority exercising the power conferred by it, but on that account, the rule cannot be said to confer an arbitrary power and be unreasonable or be in its operation unequal. The power is exercisable by the appointing authority who normally is if not the General Manager, a Senior Officer of the Railways. In con- sidering the validity of an order of determination of employment under r. 148, an assumption that the power may be exercised mala- fide and on that ground discrimination may be practised, is wholly out of place. Because of the absence of specific directions in R. 148, governing the exercise of authority conferred thereby, the power to terminate employment cannot be regarded as an arbitrary power exercisable at the sweet will of the authority, when having regard to the nature of the employment and the service to be rendered, importance of the efficient functioning of the rail transport in the interest of national economy and the Railways, Maligaon, Pandu, etc. 1963. 688 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [ 1964] status of the authority invested with the exercise of power, it may reasonably be assumed that the exercise of ·the power would Moti Ram Deka appropriately be exercised for the protection of public interest or tc on grounds of administrative convenience. Power to exercise e · discretion is not necessarily to be assumed to be a power to dis- v. . criminate unlawfully and possibility of abuse of power will not General invalidate the conferment of power.

These two groups of ap- peals have been placed before us for hearing together, Gajendragadkar because they raise a common question of law in re-· 1· gard to the Constitutional validity of Rules 148(3) and 149(3) contained in the Indian Railway Establishment Code, Vol. I. (hereafter called the Code), The first group consists of four appeals. C.A. Nos. 711 & 712 of 1962 arise from two petitions filed by the .- appellants Moti Ram Deka and Sudhir Kumar Das respectively in the Assam High Court. Deka was a peon employed by the North East Frontier Railway, whereas Das was a confirmed clerk. They alleged that purporting to exercise its power under Rule 148 of the Code, the respondent, the General Manager North East Frontier Railway, terminated their ser- vices and according to them, the said termination was illegal inasmuch as the Rule under which the -,. impugned orders of termination had been passed, was invalid. This plea has been rejected by the • Assam High Court and the writ petitions filed by the two appellants have been dismissed. It is against these orders of dismissal that they have come to this Court by special leave. Civil Appeal No. 713 of 1962 arises out of a petition filed by the appellant Priya Gupta who was an Assistant Electrical Foreman employed by the North Eastern Raijway, Gorakhpur. His services having been terminated by the respondent General Manager of the said Railway, he moved the Allahabad High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution and challenged the validity of the order terminating his i. services on the ground that Rule 148 of the Code was· invalid .. The appelll\\nt's plea has been .rejected· 1/SCI/64-44 692 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] ·1963 .railway employees concerned is that these Rules .. ·- contravene the Constitutional safeguard guaranteed iMoti Ram Deka to civil servants by Art. 311 (2). It is common ground etc. that if it is held that the Constitutional guarantee v. . prescribed by Art. 311(2) is violated by the Rules, . 'General they would be invalid; on the other hand, the Union Manag~r, N E.F. of India and the Railway Administration contend .<Rai/~ays, Jhat the said Rules do not contravene Art: 311(2), .•Mabgaon, but are wholly consistent with it. · Pandu, etc. At this stage, it would be convenient to refer Git]endragadkar to the two Rules. Rule 148 deals with the termination J. of service and periods of notice. Rule 148(1) deals with temporary railway servants; R. 148(2) deals with apprentices, and R. 148(3) ·deals with other (non-pensionable) railway servants. It is with R. 148(3) that. we are concerned in the present appeals. It reads thus:- · \"(3) Other (non-pensionable) railway servants:- The service of other (non-pensionable) railway servants shall be liable to termination on notice on either side for the periods shown below. Such notice is not however required in cases of : . dismissal or removal as a disciplinary measure '.after compliance with the provisions of Clause , ·(2) of Article 311 of the Constitution, retirement on attaining the ··age of superannuation, and -termination of service· due to · mental or phy:>ical incapacity.\" · .

R-~ k Administration to terminate the service of a 011 am e .a railway servant by paying him the pay for the etc; period of notice.\" v. General It is thus clear that R. 148(3) empowers the appropriate Manager, N.E.F. authority to terminate the services of other non-· Railways pensionable railway servants after giving them notice Ma/igao~ for the specified period, or paying them their salary Pandu et;, for the said period in lieu of notice under R 148(4). · _' The non-pensionable services were brought to Gajendragadkar an end in November, 1957 and an option was given to J. the non-pensionable servants either to opt for pension- able service or to continue on their previous terms and conditions of service. Thereafter, Rule 149 was framed in place of R. 148. Rule 149(1) & (2) like Rule 148(1) & (2) deal with the temporary railway servants and apprentices respectively. Rule 149(3) deals with other railway servants; it reads thus:- \"Other railway servants :-The services of other railway servants shall be liable to termination on notice on either side for the periods shown below. Such notice is not however, . required in cases of dismissal or removal as a disci- plinary measure after compliance with the provisions of clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution, retirement on attaining the age of superannuation, and termination of service due to mental or physical incapacity\" Th~ Rule. then specifies. the different periods f~r which notice has to be given in regard to the different categories of servants. It is unnecessary to refer to these periods. Then follow sub-rule (4). The same may be conveniently set out at this place: · '.'(4) In lieu of .th~ notice prescribed in this rule, 1t sh~ll. be p7rm1ss1ble on the part of the Railway Adm1mstrat1on to terminate the service of a railway servant by paying him the pay for the period of notice. 1963 Moti Ram Deka etc. v. General Manager, N.E.F; Railways, Ma/igliOn, Pandu, etc. 694 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] Note:-The appointing, authorites are em- powered to reduce or waive, at their discretion, the stipulated period of notice to be given by an employee, but the reason justifying their action should be recorded. This power cannot be re-delegated.\" Just as under Rule 148(3) the services ofthe railway employees to which it applied could be terminated after giving them notice for the period specified, so under R. I 49(3) termination of services of the employees con- Gajendragadkar cerned can be brought about by serving them with a J: notice for the requisite period, or paying them their salary for the said period in lieu of notice under R. 149(4). Rule 149(3) applies to all servants other than temporary servants and apprentices. The dis- tinction between pensionable and non-pensionable servants no longer prevails. The question which we have to consider in the present appeals is whether the termination of services of a permanent railway servant under Rule 148(3) or Rule 149(3) amounts to his .removal under Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. If it does, the impugned Rules are invalid; if it does not, the said Rules are vaild. That takes us to the question as to the true scope and effect of the provisions contained in Art. 3 U (2), and the decision of this question naturally involves the construction of Art. 311 (2) read in the light of Articles 309 and 3 JO. In considering this poinl!, if may be useful to refer very briefly to the genesis of these provisions and their legislative background. In this connection, it would be enough for our purpose if we begin with the Government of India Act, 1833. · Section· 74 of the said Act made the tenure · of all Services under the East India Company subject to His Majesty's pleasure. These· servants were also made subject to the pleasure of the Court of Directors with a proviso which excepted from the said rule those who had been appointed directly by His Majesty. In due course, when the Crown took over the govern- ment of this country by the Government of India Act, 1858, section 3 conferred on the Secretary of ... 1 • - 1 5S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 695 State all powers which has till then vested in the 1963 Court of Directors, while the powers in relation to the - servants of the Company which had till then ve$ted Moti Ram Deka in the Director were, by s. 37, delegated to the Secre- etc. tary of State. v. Th. . . . d . 1 ' h h General 1s pos1tJon contmue untJ we reac t e Manager NE F Government of India Act, 1915. This Act repealed Rail~ay;, · • all the earlier Parliamentary legislation and was in the Maligaon, nature of a consolidating Act. There was, however, Pandu, etc. a saving clause contained in section 130 of the said Act which preserved the earlier tenures of servants Gajendragadkar and continued the rules and regulations applicable J. to them. Section 96B of this Act which was enacted in 1919 brought about a change in the constitutional position of the civil servants. Section 96B{l ), in substance, provided that \"subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder, every person in the civil service of the Crown in India holds office during His Majesty's pleasure\", and it added that no person in that service may be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed. It also empowered the Secretary of State in Council to re-instate any person in that service who had been dismissed, except so far as the Secretary of State in Council may, by rules, provide to the contra- . ry. Section 96B(2) conferred power on the Secretary of State in Council to make rules for regulating the classification of the Civil Services in India, the method of recruitment, the conditions of service, pay and allowances and discipline and conduct while sub- section l 4) declared that all service rules then in force had been duly made and confirmed the same. In 1935, the Government of India Act 1935 was passed and s. 96Bll) was reproduced in sub-.sections (1) and (2) of section 240, and a new sub-section was. added as . ss. (3). By t?i~ new sub-section, pro- tection was given to the crvll servant by providing that he shall not be dismissed or reduced in rank until he had been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him. The definition contained in s. 277 of the said / 5S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 697 services and posts, but that must be subject to the 1963 provisions of the constitutio11 which inevitably brings -- in Art. 310(1). The proviso to Art. 309 makes Moti Ram Deka it clear that it would be competent for the President or etc. such person as he may direct in the case of services v. and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union, General and for the Governor of a State or such person as Manager, N.E.f. he may direct in the case of services and posts in Railways, connection with the affairs of the State, to make rules Maligaon, regulating the recruitment, and prescribing the con- Pandu, etc. ditions of service of persons respectively appointed . -- to services and posts under the Union or the State. Ga1endragadkar The pleasure of the President or the Governor men- J. tioned in Art. 310(1) can thus be exercised by such person as the President or the Governor may res- pectively direct in that behalf, and the pleasure thus exercised has to be exercised in accordance with the rules made in that behalf. These rules, and indeed, the exercise of the powers conferred on the delegate must be subject to Art. 310, and so Art. 309 cannot impair or affect the pleasure of the President or the Governor therein specified. There is thus no doubt that Art. 309 has to be read subject to Articles 310 and 311, and Art. 310 has to be read subject to Art. 311. It is significant that the provisions contained in Art. 311 are not subject to any other provision of the Constitution. Within the field covered by them, they are absolute and paramount. What then is the effect of the provisions contained in Art. 311(2)? Art. 311(2) reads thus:- \"No such person as aforesaid shall be dis- missed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him.\" · We are not concerned with the cases covered by the proviso to this article in the present appeals. It may be taken to be settled by the decisions of this Court that since Art. 311 makes no distinction between permanent and temporary posts, its protection must be held to extend to all government servants holding 698 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964J 1963 permanent or temporary posts or officiating in any - . of them: The protection afforded by Art. 311(2) Muti'Ram·Dekajs limited to the imposition of three major penalties . . etc. contemplated by the service Rules, viz., dismissal, v. removal or reduction in rank. It is true that the General consequences of dismissal are more serious than Manager, N.E.F. those of removal and in that sense, there is a technical Railways, distinction between the two; but in the context, dis~ Ma/igaon, missal, .. removal and reduction in rank which are Pandu, etc. specified by Art. 311 (2) represent actions taken . -- by way of penalty. In regard to temporary servants, Ga1endragadkar or servants on probation, every case of termination 1· of service ·may not amount to removal. In cases falling under these categories, the terms of contract· or service rules may provide for the termination of the services on notice of a specified period, or on payment of salary for the said period, and if in exercise of the power thus conferred on the employer, the services of a temporary or probationary servant are terminated, it may not necessarily amount to removal. In every such case, courts examine the substance of the matter, and if it is shown that the termination .. of services is no more than discharge simpliciter effected by virtue of the contract or the relevant rules, Art. 311 (2) may not be applicable to such a case. If, however, the termination of a temporary servant's services in substance represents a penalty imposed on him or punitive action taken against him, then such termination would amount to removal and Art. 311(2) would be attracted. Similar would be the position in regard to the reduc- tion in rank of an officiating servant. This aspect of the matter has been considered ·by this Court in several recent decisions, vide Jagdish Mitter v. Union of IndiaOl State of Bihar v. Gopi Kishore Prasad(2) State of Orissa & Anr. v.

Similarly, there can be no·doub~ that t~~ retire- Pa~~~~~;;, ment of a permanent servant on his attammg the age of superannuation does not amount to his re- Gajendragadkar moval within the meaning of Art. 311(2). J. The question which arises for our decision in the present appeals is: if the service of a permanent civil servant is terminated otherwise than by operation of the rule of superannuation, or the rule of compul- sory retirement does such termination amount to removal under Art. 311(2) or not ? It is on this aspect of the question that the controversy between the parties arises before us. Before dealing with this problem, it is necessary to refer to the relevant Railway Rules themselves. Speaking historically, it appears that even while the affairs of the country were in charge of the East India Company, there used to be some regulations which were substantially in the nature of administrative instructions in regard to the conditions of service of the Company's employees. These regulations were continued by s. 130(c) of the Government of India Act, 1915 which provided, inter alia that the repeal shall not affect the tenure of office, conditions of service, terms of remuneration or right to pension of any officer appointed before the commencement of this Act. Section 96B(2) which was inserted in the said Act in 1919, however, provided that the said regulations could be modified or superseded by rules framed by the Secretary of State. In due course, the Secretary of State framed certain rules. The first batch of rules was framed in December 1920. They applied to all officers in the All India' Provincial as well as Subordinate Services. and governed 700 SUPREME COURT-REPORTS [ 1964] 1963 even officers holding special posts. The Local Govern- ment had a limited power in respect of officers in the Moti Ram DekaAll-India Services under their employment and this etc. power was confined to imposing on them punishments v. of censure, reduction, withholding of promotion and General suspension (vide Rule 10); in the case of Provincial Manager, N.E.F. Services, however, the powers of the Local Govern- Railways, ment were plenary. They could not only impose Maligaon, the penalties to which we have just referred, but Pandu, etc. also remove or dismiss them (vide Rule 13). It -- appears that Rule 14 prescribed the procedure which Gajendragadkar had to be followed in imposing the penalty of dis- J. missal, removal or reduction; and so, it may be said that for the first time these three major punishments were collated together and a special procedure prescribed in that behalf. No definition of removal was, however, prescribed. Incidentally, we may refer to Rule XX which is included in the group of rules relating to appeals. Under this rule, an appeal would not lie against; (I) the discharge of a person appointed on probation before the end of his proba- tion, an.d (2) the dismissal and removal of a person appointed by an authority in India to hold a temporary appointment It would be permissible to point out that this provision would show that the termina- tion ofthe services ofa person permanently employed would not have fallen within the ambit of this rule. The Rules thus framed. in 1920 were amended from time to time and were re-issued in June, 1924. It. appears that subsequent to 1924, fresh rules were made under the Governors Provinces Civil Services (Control and Appeal) Rules and Governors Provinces Civil Services (Delegation) Rules of 1926 which were published in March, 1926. ·.Then followed the Rules framed by the Secretary of State in 1930. These Rules were in force .. when the Government of India Act, 1935 was enacted, and they continue in force even now by reason of Article. 313. We ought to add that' these Rules superseded all the earlier rules and constitute an exhaustive code as regards discip- linary m;itters .... '..'•Rule 3(b) of these,rules excluded the I 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 701 Railway Servants from the application of the 1963 said rules, and that furnishes the historical back- -- ground why separate Fundamental Rules for Railways, Moti Ram Deka corresponding to the Fundamental Rules in other etc. public services, came to be framed. v. General Before we proceed to the relevant Railway Rules, Manager, N.E.F. we may incidentally mention Rule 49 of the Rules Railways, framed by the Secretary of State in 1930. This Rule Ma/igaon, provides that penalties may, for good and sufficient Pandu, etc. reason and as hereinafter provided, be imposed . -- 'Lipon members of the services comprised in any of Ga1endragadkar the clauses (I) to (5) specified in Rule 14. These J. penalties number seven in all. Amongst them are mentioned reduction to a lower post, dismissal and re- moval. Then follows an explanation which is useful for our purpose. Before quoting that explanation, it may be pointed· out that the said explanation which was originally introduced under Rule 49, was subsequently amended once in 1948, then in 1950 and lastly in 1955 when explanation No. 2 was added. Thus amended, the two explanations read as follows:- \"Explanation I-The termination of employment- ( a) of a person appointed on probation during or at the end of the period of probation, in accor- dance with the terms of the appointment and the rules governing the probationary service; or (b) of a temporary Government servant appointed otherwise than under contract, in accordance with rule 5 of the Central Civil Services (Tempor- ary Service) Rules, 1949; or (c) of a person engaged under a contract, does not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of this rule or of rule 55. Explanation II :-Stopping a Government Servant . at an efficiency bar .in the time scale of his. pay on the ground of his unfitness to cross the bar does not amount to withholding of increments or promotions 'within the meaning of this rule.\" 702 . SUpREME COURT REP0RTS [1964] .1963 Looking at clauses (a), (b) and. (c) of Explanation I, -- it would be apparent that these clauses deal with Moti Ram Deka persons appointed on probation, . ·or appointed as · etc. temporary seryants, or engaged on a contract, and v. the effect of the said explanation is that the termination cGeneral of the services of such persons does not amount to Manager, N.E.F. removal or dismissal. within the meaning of Rule 49 or Railways, Rule 55. In other words, R. 49 read along with ex- Maligaon, planation I, would,prima facie; inferentially support the Pandu, etc. contention .that in regard to a permanent civil servant, -- the termination of his sci-vices otherwise than under Gajendragadkar the rule of superannuation or compulsory,retirement . --..,! 1· would amount to removal. ....., Let us· then consider the relevant Railway Funda- mental Rules which have a bearing on the point with which we are concerned. Paragraph 2003 . of the Code, ·Vol. II which corresponds to Fundame:ntal Rule 9 contains definitions. Fundamental·Rule 9(14) tlefines a lien as meaning the title of a Railway servant to hold substantively, either immediately or on the termination· of a period or periods of absenci:, a permanent post, including a tenure. post, to which he\" has been appointed substantively. An officiating servant is defined by F.R. 9(19) as one who performs the duties of a post on which another person holds a lien, or when a competent authority appoint!: him to officiate in a vacant post on which -no other railway servant holds a lien. There Is a proviso to this definition which is not relevant ,'for our purpose. That takes us to the definition o(· a permanent post which tinder F.R. 9(22) means a pos,t carrying a defi- nite rate of pay sanctioned without limit of time. A temporary post, on the other hand, means under F.R. 9 (29) a postcarrying a.definite rate of pay sanc- tioned for a hmited . time, and a tenure post means under F. R. 9 (30) a permanent post which an indi- vidual railway servant may not hold for more than a limiteo period. It is thus clear that as a result of the relevant definitions, a permanent post carries a definite rate of pay,,without a limit of time and a servant who substantively holds a< permanent post has , • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 703 a title to hold the post to which he is subs- 1963 tantively appointed, and that, in terms, means -- that a permanent servant has a right to hold the Moti Ram Deka post until, of course he reaches the age of superan- etc. nuation, or until he is compulsorily retired under v. ·the relevant rule. General Manager, N.E.F. It is in the light of this position that we must Railways now proceed to examine the question as to whether Maligao; the termination of the permanent servant's services Pandu, et~. either under Rule 148(3) or R. 149(3) amounts to his removal or not. . On this point, two extreme Gajendragadkar contentions have been raised before us by the parties. J. The learned Addi. · Solicitor-General contends that in ·dealing with the present controversy, we must bear in mind the doctrine of pleasure which has been enshrined in Art. 310(1). He argues that every civil servant holds his office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor. It is true that in the present cases, we are dealing with rules framed under the proviso to Art. 309 and in that sense, the question of pleasure on which so much stress is laid by the learned Addi. Solicitor-General may not directly arise; but it must be conceded that the point raised for our decision may have some impact on the doctrine of pleasure, and so it needs to be examined. The argument is that all civil service is strictly speaking precarious in character. There is no guarantee of any security of tenure, because the pleasure of the President or the Governor can be exercised at any time against the civil servant. It is true that this pleasure would not be exercised capriciously, unjustly, or unfairly, but the existence of the doctrine of pleasure inevitably imposes a stamp of precarious charac- ter on the tenure enjoyed by the civil servant, and so, it is urged whether Rule 148 or R. 149 is made or not, it would be open to the President or the Governor to terminaJe the services of any civil .servant to whose case Art. 310(1) applies. The learned Addi. Solicitor-General has also impressed upon us the necessity to construe Art. 310(1) and Art. 311 in such a manner that the pleasure 704 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 contemplated by Art. 310ll) does not become illusory -- or is not completely obliterated. He, theri~fore, .Moti Ram Deka.suggests that Art. 311(2) which is in the nature of a etc. proviso or an exception to Art. 310(1) must be strictly v. construed and in all cases falling outside the scope of General the said provision, the pleasure of the President'or the Manager, N.E.F. Govem<;>r must be allowed to rule supreme. Railwavs, . . Malig;on, · On the oth~r hand, 1t has ~een urged .by the learned Pandu etc counsel appearmg for the railway servants concerned ' · before us that the pleasure of the President is controlled Gajendragad/wr by Art. 311 and if the argument. of the learned Addi. J. · Solicitor-General is accepted and full scope given to the· exercise . of the said pleasure, Art. 311 itself would become otiose. It is urged that the employment in civil service can be terminated only after complying with Art. 311 and any rule which violates the guarantee provided by the said Article would be invalid. Jn fact, the argument on the other side is that the ·word \"removal\" should receive a much wider denotation than has been accepted by this Court in its decisions bearing cm the point, and that all terminations of services in respect of all categories of public servants should be held to constitute removal within Art. 311(2). We are inclined to hold that the two extreme conten- tions raised by both the parties must . be rejected. There is no doubt that the pleasure of the President on which the learned Addi. Solicitor Qeneral so strong- ly relies has lost some of its majesty and power, because it is clearly controlled by the provisions of Art. 311, and so, the field that is covered by Art. 311 on a fair and reasonable construction of the re- levant words used in that article, would be excluded from the operation of the absolute doctrine of pleasure: The pleasure of the President would still be tlu:re, but it· has . to be exercised in accordance with the requirements of Art. 311. · Besides, as this Court has held in · the State of Biharv. Abdul MajidO>, the rule of English Law pithily expressed in. the Iatin phrase \"duranto bene placito\" (\"during pleasure\") has not been fully adopted either (i) [1954) S.C.R. 786, 799. . < ' I I • .... • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 705 by section 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935 1963 or by Art. 310(1). To the extent to which that rule has been modified by the relevant provisions of Moti Ram Deka s. 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935, or Art. etc. 311 the Government servants are entitled to relief like v. any other person under the ordinary law and that General relief must be regulated by the Code of Civil Proce- Manager, N.E.F. dure. It is mainly on the basis of this principle Railways, that this Court refused to apply the doctrine against Maligaon, abdul Majid that a civil servant cannot maintain suit Pandu, etc. against a State or against the Crown for the recovery of arrears of salary due to him. Thus, the extreme Gajendragadkar contention based on the doctrine of pleasure enshrined J. in Art. 310(1) cannot be sustained. Similarly, we do not think it would be possible to accept the argu- ment that the word \"removal\" in Art. 311(2) should receive the widest interpretation. Apart from the fact that the said provision is in the nature of a proviso to Art. 310(1) and must, therefore, be strictly construed, the point raised by the contention is concluded by the decisions of this Court and we propose to deal with the present appeals on the basis that the word \"removal\" like the two other words \"dismissal\" and \"reduction in rank\" used in Art. 311 (2) refer to cases of major penalties which were specified by the relevant service rules. Therefore, the true position is that Articles 310 and 311 must no doubt be read together, but once the true scope and effect of Art. 311 is determined, the scope and effect of Art. 310(1) must be limited in the sense that in regard to cases falling under Art. 311(2) the pleasure mentioned in Art. 310(1) must be exercised in accordance with the requirements of Art. 311. It is then urged by the learned Addi. Solicitor General that Art. 310 does not permit of the concept of tenure during good behaviour. According to him, in spite of the rule of superannuation, the services of a civil servant can be terminated by the President exercising his pleasure at any time. The rule of superannuation on this contention merely gives an indication to the civil servant as to the length of time !/SCI/64-45 706 SUPREME COURT REPORTS . [1964] 1963 he may expect to serve, but it gives him no ri1~1t to continue during the whole of the said period. In fact, Moti Ram Deka the learned Addl. Solicitor-General did not disguis'e the etc, fact that according to his argument, whether or not v a rule of superannuation is framed and whether or not General Rule 148 or R. 149 is issued, the President's pleasure Manager N.E.F.can be exercised independently of these Rules and Railways, the action taken by the President in exercise of his Maligaon, pleasure cannot be questioned under Art. 311(2). Pandu, etc. · Alternatively, he contends that if Art. 311(2) G . d-- dk is read in a very general and wide sense, even th1.: rule a;enragaar · h f · b · d j · as to t e age o superannuat10n may e quest1one as · being invalid, because it does put an end to the service of a civil servant. We are not impressed by this argument, We will no doubt have to decide what cases of termi- nation of services of permanent civil servants amount to removal; but once that question is determined, wherever it is shown that a permanent civil servant is removed from his service, Art. 311(2) will apply and Art. 310(1) cannot be invoked independently with the object of justifying the contravention of the provisions of Art. 311(2). In regard to the age of superannuation, it may be .../ said prima facie that rules of superannuation which are prescribed in respect of public services in all modern States are based on considerations of life expectation, mental capacity of the civil servants having regard to the climatic conditions under which they work, and tile nature of the work they do. They are not fixed on any ad hoc basis and do not involve the exercise of any discretion. They apply uniformly to all public servants falling under the category in respect of which they are framed. Therefore, no analogy can be suggested between the rule of super- annu.ation and Rule 148(3) or Rule 149(3). Besides, nobody has questioned the validity of the. rule of super- annuation, and so, it would be fruitless and idle to consider whether such a rule can be challenged at all. · Reverting then to the nature of the right which a permanent servant has under the relevant Railway Rules, whitt is the true position? A person who !\" ~ '·' ~ '.f -, 5S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 707 substantively holds a permanent post has a right 1963 to continue in service, subject, of course, to the rule - of superannuation and the rule as to compulsory Moti Ram Deka retirement. If for any other reason that right is in- etc. vaded and he is asked to leave his service, the termina- v. tion of his service must inevitably mean the defeat General of his right to continue in service and as such, it is Manager, N.E.F. in the nature of a penalty and amounts to removal. Railways, In other words, termination of the services of a perma- Maligaon, nent servant otherwise than on the ground of super- Pandu; etc. annuation or compulsory retirement, must per se -. - amount to his removal, and so, if by R.148(3) or R.149(3) Gajendragadkar such a termination is brought about, the Rule clearly J, contravenes Art. 311(2) and must be held to be invalid. It is common ground that neither of the two Rules contemplates an enquiry and in none of the cases before us has the procedure prescribed by Art. 311(2) been followed. We appreciate the argument urged by the learned Addi. Solicitor-General about the pleasure of the President and its significance; but since the pleasure has to be exercised subject to the provisions of Art. 311, there would be no escape from the conclusion that in respect of cases falling under Art. 311 (2 ), the procedure prescribed by the said Article must be complied with and the exercise of pleasure regulated accordingly. In this connection, it is necessary to emphasise that the rule-making authority contemplated by Art. 309 cannot be validly exercised so as to curtail or affect the rights guaranteed to public servants under Art. 311(1). Art. 311(1) is intended to afford a sense of security to public servants who are substantively appointed to a permanent post and one of the principal benefits which they are entitled to expect is the benefit of pension after rendering public service for the period prescribed by the Rules. It would, we think, not be legitimate to contend that the right to earn a pension to which a servant substantively appointed to a perma- nent post is entitled can be curtailed by Rules framed under Art. 309 so as to make the said right either ineffective or illusory. Once the scope of Art. 311 (1 ~ and (2) is duly determined, it must be held that no Rule 708 SUPREME COURT REPORTS . [1964] 1963 framed under Art. 309 can trespass on the rights guaranteed by Art. 311. This position is of basic Mati Ram Dekc importance and must be borne in mind in dealing etc. with the controversy in the present appeals. · G v.ial . At this stage, we ought to add that in a modern u ;ne NE F democratic State the efficiency and incorruptibility of a\"; -~'~ay; · ·public administration is of such importance that it ;,' / . ' is essential to afford to civil servants adequate pro- p a ;ga;~ tection against capricious action from their superior an. u, · authority. If a permanent civil servant is guilty of Gajendragadkar misconduct, he should no doubt be proceeded against J. promptly under the relevant disciplinary rules, sub- ject, of course, to the safeguard prescribed by Art. 311(2); but in regard to honest, straightforward and efficient permanent civil servants, it is of utmost importance even from the point of view of the State that they should enjoy a sense of security which alone can make them independent and truly efficient, In our opinion, the sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of permanent railway servants in the form of R. 148(3) or R. 149(3) would inevitably create a sense of insecurity in the minds of such servants and would invest appropriate authorities with very wide powers which may conceivably be abused. In this connection, no distinction can be made between pensionable and non-pensionable service. Even if a person is holding a post which does not carry any pension, he has a right to continue in service until he reaches the age of superannuation and the said right is a very valuable right. That is why the invasion of this right must inevitably mean that the termination of his service is, in substance, and in law, removal from service. It appears that after Rule · 149 was brought into force in 1957, another provision has been made by Rule 321 which seems to contemplate the award of some kind of pension to the employees whose services are terminated under Rule 149(3). But it is significant that the application of R. 149(3) does not require, as normal rules of compulsory retirement do, that the power conferred by the said Rule can be exercised in respect of servants who have • - --t- • 5 S.C.R SUPREME COURT REPORTS 709 put in a prescribed minimum period of service. There- 1963 fore, the fact that some kind of proportionate pen- - sion is awardable to railway servants whose services Moti Ram Deka are terminated under R. 149(3) would not assimilate etc. the cases dealt with under the said Rule to cases of v. compulsory retirement. As we will presently point out, General cases of compulsory retirement which have been con- Manager, N.E.F. sidered by this Court were all cases where the rule as Railways, to compulsory retirement came into operation before Maligaon, the age of supperannuation was reached and after Pandu, etc. a prescribed minimum period of service had been . - put in by the servant. Ga1endragadkar It is true that the termination of service authorised by R. 148(3) or R.149(3) contemplates the right to termi- nate on either side. For all practical purposes, the right conferred on the servant to terminate his services after giving due notice to the employer does not mean much in the present position of unemployment in this country; but apart from it, the fact that a ser- vant has been given a corresponding right cannot detract from the position that the right which is conferred on the railway authorities by the impugned Rules is inconsistent with Art. 311(2), and so, it has to be struck down in spite of the fact that a similar right is given to the servant concerned. It has, however, been urged that the railway servants who entered service with the full knowledge of these Rules cannot be allowed to complain that the Rules contravene Art. 311 and are, therefore, invalid. It appears that under Rule 144 (which was originally Rule 143), it was obligatory on railway- servants to execute a contract in terms of the re- levant Railway Rules. That is how the argument based on the contract and its binding character arises. If a person while entering service executes a contract containing the relevant Rule in that behalf with open eyes, how can he be heard to challenge the validity of the said Rule, or the said contract 7 In our opinion, this approach may be relevant in dealing with purely commercial cases governed by rules of contract; but it is wholly inappropriate in dealing with a case J. 710 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 where the contract or the Rule is , alleged to violate -- a constitutional guarantee afforded by Art. 311(2); Moti Ram Deka and even as to commercial transactions, it is well- etc. known that if the contract is void, as for instance, v. under s. 23 of the Indian Contract Act, the plea that General it was executed by the party would be of no avail. Manager, N.E.F. In any case, we do not think that the argument Railways, of contract and its binding character can have vabdity Ma/igaon, in dealing with the question about the constitution- Pandu, etc. ality of the impugned Rules. Gajendragadkar Let us then test this argument by reference to J. the provisions of Art. 311 (1 ). Art. 311 (I) provides that no person to whom the said article applies shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordi- nate to that by which he was appointed. Can it be suggested that the Railway Administration can enter into a contract with its employees by which authority to dismiss or remove the employees can be delegated to persons other than those contemplated by Art. 311(1)? The answer to this question is obviously in the negative, and the same answer must be given to the conten\" tion that as a result of the contract which embodies the impugned Rules, the termination of the railway servant's· services would not attract the provisions of Art. 311 (2), though, in law, .it amounts to removal. If the said termination does not amount to removal, then, of course, Art. 311(2) would be inapplicable and the challenge to the validity of the impugned Rules would fail; but if the termination in question amounts to a removal, the challenge to the validity of the impugned Rules must succeed notwithstanding the fact that the Rule has been included in a contract signed by the railway servant. , There is one more point which still remains to be considered and that is the point of construction. The learned Addl. Solicitor-General argued · that in construing the impugned Rule 148(3) as well as R. 149(3), we ought to take into account the fact that the Rule as amended has been so framed as to avoid conflict with, or non-compliance of, the provisions of Art. 311 (2), and so, he suggests that we should - • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 711 adopt that interpretation of the Rule which would 1963 be consistent with Art. 311(2). The argument is -- that the termination of services permissible under Moti Ram Deka the impugned Rules really proceeds on administrative etc. grounds or considerations of exigencies of service. .v. If, for instance, the post held by a permanent servant General is abolished, or the whole of the cadre to which the Manager, N.E.F. post belonged is brought to an end and the railway Railways, servant's services are terminated in consequence, Maligaon, that cannot amount to his removal because the ter- Pandu, etc. mination of his services is not based on any consi- . -- deration personal to the servant. In support of this Ga1endragadkar argument, the Addl. ·Solicitor-General wants us to 1 - test the provision contained in the latter portion of the impugned Rules. We are not impressed by this argument. What the latter portion of the impugned Rules provides is that in case a railway servant is dealt with under that portion, no notice need be served on him. The first part of the Rules can reason- ably and legitimately take in all cases and may be used even in respect of cases falling under the latter category, provided, of course, notice for the spe- cified period or salary in lieu '()f such notice is given to the railway servant. There is no doubt that on a fair construction, the impugned Rules authorise the Rail- way Administration to terminate the services of all the permanent servants to whom the Rules apply merely on giving notice for the specified period, or on pay- ment of salary in lieu thereof, and that clearly amounts to the removal of the servant in question. Therefore,, we are satisfied that the impugned Rules are invalid in as much as they are inconsistent with the provisions contained in Art. 311(2). The termination of the permanent servants' tenure which is authorised· by the said Rules is no more and no less than their re- moval from service, and so, Art. 311(2) must come into play in respect of such cases.. That being so, the Rule which does not require compliance with the pro\" cedure prescribed by Art. 311(2) must be struck down as invalid. It is now necessary to examine some of the cases on which the learned Addl. Solicitor-General has 712 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 relied. In fact, as we have already indicated, his - main argument was that some of the observations Moti Ram Deka made in some of the decisions to which we will pre- etc. sently refer support his contention and logically lead v. to the conclusion that the impugned 'Rules are valid. General That naturally makes it necessary for us to examine Manager, N.E.F. the said cases very carefully. In Satish Chandra Railways, Anand v. The Unfon of IndiaO), this Court was dealing Maligaon, with the case of a person who had been employed Pandu, etc. by the Government of India on a five-year contract . --,- in the Resettlement and Employment Directorate of Ga;endragadkar the Ministry of Labour. When his contract was J. due to expire, a new offer was made to him to continue. · him in service in his post temporarily for the period of the Resettlement and Employment Organisation on the condition that he would be governed by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1949. The relevant rule in that behalf authorised the termi- nation of the contract on either side by one month's notice. Subsequently, his services were terminated after· giving him one month's notice. He challenged the validity of the said order, but did not succeed for the reason that neither Art. 14 nor Art. 16 on which he relied really applied. This Court held that it is competent to the State to enter into contracts of temporary employment subject to the term that the contract would be terminated on one month's notice on either side. Such a contract was not in- consistent with Art. 311(2). This case, therefore, is of no assistance in the present appeals. In Gopal Krishna Potnay v. Union of India & Anr. (2) a permanent railway employee who was dis- charged from service after one month's notice brought a suit challenging the validity of the order terminating his services. The point about the validity of the Rule was not agitated before the Court. Ques- tions which were raised for the decision of the Court were, inter clia, whether the agreement in question had been executed by the servant and whether the (I) [19531 S.C.R. 655. (2) A.LR. 1954 S.C. 632. • ' . - 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 713 termination of his services amounted to a discharge or not. In that connection, reference was made to 1963 Rules 1504 and 1505 and it was held that the conduct Moti Ram Deka of the parties showed that the termination of the etc. servant's services was not more than a discharge v. in terms of the agreement. This case again is of General no assistance. Manager, N.E.F. That takes us to the decision in the case of Shyam Lal v. The State of U.P. and the Union of Indialll Shyam Lal's services were terminated under Art. 465-A of the Civil Service Regulations and Note I appended thereto. Shyam Lal alleged that his compulsory retirement offended the provisions of Art. 311 (2) on the ground that compulsory retirement was in substance removal from service. This Court considered the scheme of the relevant Rule and held that compulsory retirement did not amount to removal within the mean- ing of Art. 311(2). In dealing with this question, this Court observed that removal was almost synony- mous with dismissal and that in the case of removal as in the case of dismissal, some ground personal to the servant which was blameworthy was involved. There was a stigma attached to the servant who was removed and it involved a loss of benefit already • earned by him. It is in the light of these tests that this Court held that compulsory retirement did not amount to removal. It is true that in dealing with the argument about the loss of benefit, this Court observed • that a distinction must be made between the loss of benefit already earned and the loss of prospect of earning something more, and it proce::ded to add that in the first case, it is a present and certain loss and is certainly a punishment, but the loss of future prospect is too uncertain, for the officer may die or be otherwise incapacitated from serving a day longer and cannot, therefore, be regarded in the eye of the law as a punishment. It appears that in dealing with the point, the attention of the Court was drawn to Railways, Maligaon, Pandu, etc. Gajendragadkar J. • Rule 49 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control ,. and Appeal) Rules, and presumably the explanation (!) [1955) 1 S.C.R. 26. 714 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] ~ ~· 1963 to the said Rule to which we have already referred, was taken into account in rejecting the argument Moti Ram Deka that a loss of future service cannot be said to be a etc. relevant factor in determining the question as to whether v. compulsory retirement is removal or not. The judg- General ment does not show that the invasion of the right Manager, N.E.F. which a permanent servant has, to remain in service Railways, until he reaches the age of superannuation, was Maligaon, pressed before the Court, and naturally the same has Pandu, etc. not been examined. Confining itself to the special - features of compulsory retirement which was effected Gajendragadkar under Art. 465-A and Note I appended thereto, the J. Court came to the conclusion that compulsory re- tirement was not removal. We may add that subse- quent decisions show that the same view has been taken in respect of compulsory retirement throughout and so, that branch of the law must be held to be concluded by the series of decisions to which we shall presently refer. We would, however, like to make it clear that the observation made in the judg- ment that every termination of service does not amount to dismissal or removal should, in the context, be confined to the case of compulsory retirement and should not be read as a decision of the question with which we are directly concerned in the present appeals. That problem did not arise before the Court iri that case, was not argued before it, and cannot, therefore, be deemed to have been decided by this decision. Then we have a batch of four decisions reported • in 1958 which are relevant for our purpose. In Hartwell Prescott Singh v. The Uttar Pradesh Govern- ment & Ors.<1\\ a civil servant held a post in a temporary capacity in the Subordinate Agriculture Service, Uttar Pradesh, and was shown in the gradation list as on probation. He was later appointed with the approval of the Public Service Commission of the United Provinces to officiate in Class II of the said Service. After about 10 years, he was reverted to his original temporary appointment and his services were there- after terminated under Rule 25(4) of the Subordinate 1:, (1) [1958] S.C.R. 509. -... ' 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 715 Agriculture Service Rules. Dealing with the said 1963 civil servant's objection that the termination of his -- services contravened Art. 311 (2), this Court held that Moti Ram Deka reversion from a temporary post held by a person etc. does not per se amount to reduction in rank. v. To decide whether the reversion is a reduction in General rank, the post held must be of a substantive rank; Manager, N.E.F. and further it must be established that the order of Railways, reversion was by way of penalty. As we have already Maligaon, discussed, the cases of temporary servants, probationers Pandu, etc. and servants holding posts in officiating capacities stand on a different footing and the principles applicable Gajendragadkar to them are now firmly established and need not J. detain us . The next decision in the same volume is the State of Bombay v. Saubhagchand M. Doshi OJ. This was a case of compulsory retirement under Rule 165-A of the Bombay Civil Services Rules as amended by the Saurashtra Government. In so far as this case dealt with the compulsory retirement of a civil servant, it is unnecessary to consider the Rule in question or the facts relating to the compulsory re- tirement of the civil servant. It is of interest to note that in dealing with the question as to whether com- pulsory retirement amounted to removal or not, the tests which were applied were in regard to the loss of benefit already accrued and stigma attached to the civil servant. It is, however, significant that in considering the objection based on the contraven- tion of Art. 311(2), Venkatarama Aiyar J. took the precaution of adding that \"questions of the said character could arise only when the rules fix both an .age of superannuation and an age for compulsory retirement and the services of a civil servant are terminated between these two points of time. But wh~re there is. no rul: fixing the age of compulsory retirement, or if there rs one and the servant is retired before the age prescribed therein, then that can be regarded only as dismissal or removal within Art. 311 (2).\" It would be noticed that the rule providing (I) [1958] S.C.R. 571. 716 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 for compulsory retirement was upheld on the ground that such compulsory retirement does not amount to Moti Ram Dekaremoval under Art. 311(2) because it was another etc. mode of retirement and it could be enforced only v. between the period of age of superannuation prescribed General and after the minimum period of service indicated in Manager, N.E.F. the rule had been put in. If, however, no such mini- Railways, mum period is prescribed by the rule of compulsory Maligaon, retirement, that according to the judgment, would Pandu, etc. violate Art. 311(2) and though the termination of -- a servant's services may be described as compulsory Gajendragadkar retirement, it would amount to dismissal or removal < J. within the meaning of Art. 311(2). With respect, we think that this statement correctly represents the true position in law. The third case in the said volume is the case of Parshotam la! Dhingra v. Union of India.<1 J In this case, Das C.J. who spoke for the Bench considered compre- hensively the scope and effect of ther elevant consti- tutional provisions, service rules and their. impact on the question as to whether reversion of Dhingra offended the provisions of Art. 311(2). Dhingra was appointed as a Signaller in 1924 and promoted to the post of Chief Controller in 1950. Both these posts were in Class III Service. In 1951, he was appointed to officiate in Class II Service as Asstt. Superintendent, Railway Telegraphs. On certain adverse remarks having been made against him, he was reverted as a subordinate till he made good the short-comings. Then, Dhingra made a representation. This was followed by a notice issued by the General Manager reverting him to Class III appointment. It was this ordei: of reversion which was challenged by Dhingra by a writ petition. It would thus be seen that the point with which the Court was directly concerned was whether the reversion of an officiating officer to his permanent post constituted reduction in rank or removal under Art. 311(2). The decision of this question was somewhat complicated by the fact that certain defects were noticed in the work of Dhingra (1) [1958] S.C.R. 828. r '( I 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 717 and the argument was that his reversion was in the 1963 nature of a penalty, and so, it should be treated as -- reduction under Art. 311(2). This Court rejected Moti Ram Deka Dhingra's contention and held that the reversion of etc. an officiating officer to his substantive post did not v. attract the provisions of Art. 311 (2). Though the General decision of the question which directly arose before Manager, N.E.F. this Court thus lay within a very narrow compass, Railways, it appears that the matter was elaborately argued Maligaon, before the Court and the learned Chief Justice has Pandu, etc. exhaustively considered all the points raised by the parties. For our present purpose, it is unnecessary Gajendragadkar to summarise the reasons given by the learned Chief J. Justice for holding that the reversion of Dhingra did not amount to reduction in rank. The only point which has to be considered by us is whether the observations made in the course of this judgment in regard to permanent servants assist the ·learned Addi. Solicitor-General and if they do, what is their effect? Broadly stated, this decision widened the scope of Art. 311 by including within its purview not only permanent servants, but temporary servants and servants holding officiating posts also. The decision further held that dismissal, removal and reduction represent the three major penalties contemplated by the relevant service rules and it is only where the impugned orders partake of the character of one or the other of the said penalties that Art. 311 (2) can be invoked. In the course of his judgment the learned Chief Justice has referred to Rule 49 and the expla- nation attached thereto. The explanation to the Rule clearly shows that it refers to persons appoin- ted on probation, or persons holding temporary appointments and contractual posts. It is in the light of this explanation that the learned Chief Justice proceeded to examine the contention raised by Dhingra that his reversion amounted to reduction in rank, and so, it became necessary to examine whether any loss of benefit already accrued had been incurred, or any stigma had been attached to the servant before he was reverted. It is in that connection that the Court also held that though a kind of enquiry may have 718 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [ 1964] 1963 been held and the short-comings in the work of Dhingra . may have weighed in the mind of the authority who Motz Ram Deka reverted him, the said motive could not alter the charac- etc. ter of reversion which was not reduction within the v. meaning of Art. 311(2). All those points have been General considered and decided and so far as the temporary Manager, N.E.F. servants probationers, or contractual servants are Railways, concerned, they are no longer in doubt. Maligaon, Pandu, etc. In regard to permanent servants, the learned G . -- Chief Justice has made some observations which it · a1end7gadkar is n~w necessary to consider very carefully. \"The · appomtment of a government servant to a permanent post,\" observed the learned C.J., \"may be substantive or on probation or on an officiating basis. A sub- stantive appointment to a permanent post in public service confers normally on the servant so appoin- ted a substantive right to the post and he becomes entitled to hold a lien on the post. \"(p. 841) On the same subject, the learned C.J has later added that \"in the absence of any special contract, the substantive appointment to a permanent post gives the servant so appointed a right to hold the post until, under the rules, he attains the age of superannuation or is com- pulsorily retired after having put in the prescribed number of years' service, or the post is abolished and his service cannot be terminated except by way of punishment for misconduct, negligence, ineffi- ciency or any other disqualification found against him on proper enquiry after due notice to him.\" (p. 843). Reading these two observations together, there can be no doubt that with the exception of appoint- ments held under special contract, the Court took the view that wherever a civil servant was appointed to a permanent post substantively, he had a right to hold that post until he reached the age of super- annuation or was compulsorily retired, or the post was abolished. In all other cases, if the services of the said servant were terminated, they would have to be in conformity with the provisions of Art. 311 (2), because termination in such cases amounts to removal. The two statements of the law to which we have just I 6\"\" 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 719 1963 I referred do not leave any room for doubt on this point. Moii Ram Deka etc. Later during the course of the judgment, learn- ed C.J. proceeded to examine Rule 49 and the ex- v. planations added to it, and then reverting to the General question of permanent servants once again, he obser-Manag~r, NE.F. ved that \"it has already been said that where a person Rarlways, is appointed substantively to a permanent post in Mahgaon, Government service, he normally acquires a right Pandu, etc. to hold the post until under the rules, he attains the age of superannuation or is compulsorily retired Gajendragadkar and in the absence of a contract, express or implied, J. or a service rule, he cannot be turned out of his post unless the post itself is abolished or unless he is guilty of misconduct, negligence, inefficiency or other dis- qualifications and appropriate proceedin~s are taken under the service rules read with Art. 311(2). Termina- tion of service of such a servant so appointed must per se be a punishment, for it operates as a forfeiture of the servant's rights and brings about a premature end of his employment.\" (pp. 857-58). With respect, we ought to point out that though the learned C.J. at this place purports to reproduce what had already been stated in the judgment, he has made two signi- ficant additions because in the present statement, he refers to a contract or service rules which may permit the authority to terminate the services of a permanent servant without taking the case under Art. 311(2), though such termination may not amount to ordinary or compulsory retirement. The absence of contract, express or implied, or a service rule, which has been introduced in the present statement are not to be found in the earlier statements to which we have already referred, and addition of these two clauses apparently is due to the fact that the learned C.J. considered Rule 49 and the explanations attached thereto and brought them into the discussion of a permanent servant, and that, we venture to think, is not strictly correct. As we have already seen, Explanation No. 1 to R. 49 is confined to the three categories of officers specified by it in its clauses (a), 720 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 (b) and (c), and it has no relevance or application to the - cases of permanent servants. Moti Ram Deka etc. Similarly, the same statement is repeated with v. the observation \"as already stated, if the servant General has got a right to continue in the post, then, unless Manager, N.E.F. the contract of employment or the rules provide to Raz;.ways, the contrary, his services cannot be terminated other- Ma ~gaon, wise than for misconduct, negligence, inefficiency Pan u, etc. or other good and sufficient cause. A termination G . -d dk of the service of such a servant on such grounds a1en raga ar b · h d h ,. d\" · 1 J must e a pums ment an , t ere1ore, a 1sm1ssa · or removal within Art. 311, for it operates as a for- feiture of his right and he is visited with the evil con- sequences of loss of pay and allowances.\" (p. 862). With respect, we wish to make the same comment about this statement which we have already made about the statement just cited. In this connection, it may be relevant to add that in the paragraph where this statement occurs, the learned C.J. was summing up the position and the cases there considered are cases of Satish Chandra Anand, Cl) and Shyam Lal (2J, These two cases were concerned with the termination of a temporary servant's services and the compul- sory retirement of a permanent servant respectively, and strictly speaking, they do not justify the broader proposition enunciated at the end of the paragraph. At the conclusion of his judgment, the learned C.J. has observed that \"in every case, the Court has to apply the two tests mentioned above, namely, (1) whether the servant had a right to the post or the rank or (2) whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore referred to.\" (p. 863) It would be noticed that the two tests are not cumulative, but are alternative, so that if the first test is satisfied, termination of a permanent servant's services would amount to removal because his right to the post has been prematurely invaded. The learned C.J. himself makes it clear by adding (I) [1953] S.C.R. 655. (2) [1955] I S.C.R. 26, r 724 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 read that statement as a decision that R. 148(3) is valid. To read the said statement in that manner Moti Ram Deka would be to ignore the fact that this Court had re- etc. versed the conclusion of the High Court that the v. impugned order was valid under R. 148(3) speci- General fically on the ground that that case had not been made Manager, N.E.F. out by the Union of India and should not have been Railways, adopted by the High Court. It is thus clear that Maligaon, as the case was argued before this Court and consi- Pandu, etc. dered, R. 148(3) was outside the controversy between . -- • the parties. That is why it would be unreasonable Ga;endragadkar to rely on the reference to R. 148 in the statement 1· made in the judgment on which the learned Addi. Solicitor-General relies. There is another aspect of this question to which t we may incidentally refer before we part with this case. We have already quoted the observation of fl Venkatarama Aiyar J. in the case of Subhagchand M. Doshi 0) to the effect that if compulsory retirement is permitted by any service rule without fixing the minimum period of service after which the Rule can be invoked, termination of the services of a permanent civil servant by the application of such a Rule would be dismissal or removal under Art. 311(2), and we have indicated that we regard that statement as correctly representing the true legal • position in the matter. It appears that when this Court decided the case of Balakotaiah, this aspect of the matter was not argued before the Court and l- the observation to which we have just referred was not brought to its notice. One more case which still remains to be consider- ed in this context is the decision in Dalip Singh v. The State of Punjab<•>. In this case, Dalip Singh was compulsorily retired from service by the Rajpramukh of Pepsu exercising his power under Rule 278 of the Patiala State Regulations, 1931. In the suit from which the appeal before this Court arose he alleged that the order of retirement passed against him amoun- ~ (!) [1958] S.C.R. 571. (2) [1961] 1 S.C.R. 88. S S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 727 1963 148(3) and 149(3) which permit the termination of a permanent railway servant's services in the manner provided by them, are invalid because the termination Moti Ram Deka of services which the said Rules authorise is removal etc. of the said railway permanent servant and it contra- v. venes the constitutional safeguard provided by Art. · General 311(2). Manager, N.E.F. After this Court pronounced its decision in the case of Shyam Lalc:Li the question about the validity of Rule 148(3) has been considered by several High Courts and it must be conceded that with the exception of two decisions of the Calcutta High Court in Union of India v. Someswar Banerjee<21 , and Fakir Chandra Chiki v. S. Chakravarti & Ors <31 , which have held that R. 1709 and R. 148(3) of the Railway Rules are respectively invalid, the consensus of judi- cial opinion is in favour of the contention raised _by the learned Addi. Solicitor-General. These decisions have held that R. 148(3) is constitutionally valid (vide Biswanath Singh v. District Traffic Supdt., N.E. Railway, Sonepur<•1 , The Union of India v. Askaran <5 > Hardwari Lal v. General Manager, North Eastern Railway, Gorakhpur<•> and Anr., Kishan Prasad v. The Union of India<7> and D.S. Srinath v. General Manager, Southern Railway, Madras<•>. In fairness, we ought to add that all these decisions proceeded on the basis that the observations made by this Court either in !he case of Shyam La/<1>, or in the case of Dhingra C9> m respect of permanent servants amounted fo a decision oi:i that point and were, therefore, binding on the H1g~ Courts. . Some decisions purport to ~dopt t~e sa1~ observations and extend them logically m dealmg with the question about the validity of Rul.e. 148(3 ). With respect, we must hold that these dec~s~ons. do not correctly represent the true legal pos1t10n m regard to the character of R. 148(3). (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 26. (i) A.LR. 1954 Cal. 399.

Railways, Ma/igaon, Pandu, etc. Gajendragadkar J. ' • 5 S.C.R; SUPREME COURT REPORTS 729 On the other hand, the Addi. Solicitor-General 1963 has contended that the very purpose of the Rule -- gives guidance to the appropriate authority exercising Moti Ram Deka its power under it; in exercising the said power the etc. appropriate authority will have to take into account v. all the relevant circumstances in regard to the nature General and quality of the work of the railway servant in Manager, N.E.F question and will have to decide whether there are Railll'ays, circumstances which require that_ the services of the Ma/igaon, said servant should be terminated. In dealing with Pandu, et_c. such a question, it is plain that the appropriate autho- _ -- rity would naturally have regard for considerations Ga1endragadkar of public interest and the interest of the Railway J. Administration. Therefore, it is suggested that the Rule cannot be struck down on the ground that it confers absolute, unguided and uncanalised power on the appropriate authority. Since we have come to the conclusion that the second attack made against the validity of the Rule under Art. 14 ought to be sus- tained we do not propose to express any opinion on this part of the controversy between the parties. The other aspect of the matter arises from the fact that no other branch of public service contains such a rule for its civil servants. The true scope and effect of Art. 14 has been considered by this Court on several occasions. It may, however, be sufficient to refer to the decision of this Court in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S.R. Tendolker & OrsYl After examining the Article and the relevant decisions of this Court bearing on it, Das C.J. who spoke for the Court stated the position in the form of propositions, (a) to (f). Propositions (a) and (f) are relevant for our purpose. \"The decisions of this Court establish,\" said Das C.J., \"(a) that a law may be constitutional even though it relates to a single individual if, on account of some special circum- stances or reasons applicable to him and not appli- cable to others, that single individual may be treated as a class by himself; and (f) that while good faith and knowledge of the existing conditions on the part (I) [1959] S.C.R. 279 at P. 297. 730 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 of a legislature are to be presumed, if there is nothing -- on the face of the law or the surrounding circumstances Moti Ram Deka brought to the notice of the court on which the classi- etc. fication may reasonably be regarded as based, the v. presumption of constitutionality cannot be carried General to the extent of always holding that there must be Manager, N.E.F.some undisclosed and unknown reasons for subjecting Railways, certain individuals or corporations to hostile or Maligaon, discriminating legislation.\" Applying these two prin- Pandu, etc. ciples, it is difficult to understand on what ground . -- employment by the Railways alone can be said to Ga1endragadkar constitute a class by itself for the purpose of framing J. the impugned Rules. If considerations of adminis- trative efficiency or exigencies of service justify the making of such a rule, why should such a Rule not have been framed in the Posts & Telegraph Depart- ment to take only one instance. The learned Additional Solicitor-General frankly conceded that the affi- davits filed by the Railway Administration or the Union of India afforded no material on which the framing of the Rule only in respect of one sector of public service can be justified. We appreciate the argu- ment that the nature of services rendered by emplo- yees in different sectors of public service may differ and the terms and conditions governing employ- ment in all public sectors may not necessarily be the same or uniform; but in regard to the question of terminating the services of a civil servant after serving him with a notice for a specified period, we are unable to see how the Railways can be regarded as constituting a separate and distinct class by re- ference to which the impugned Rule can be justified in the light of Art. 14. If there is any rational con- nection between the making of such a Rule and the object intended to be achieved by it, that connection would clearly be in existence in several other sectors of public service. What has happened is that a pro- vision like R. 148(3) or R. 149(3) was first made by the Railway Companies when employment with the Railways was a purely commercial matter governed by the ordinary rules of contract. After the Railways were taken over by the State, that position has essen- , ' T f - 732 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 the. powers· of the President .or, the Governor under Art: 310 read with Art. 31L · It has also been stated Mori Ram Dekaat the same place that the power .fo dismiss a public ere. \"· servant at pleasure is outside the scope of Art. 154 v. . _and, therefore, cannot be delegated by the Governor General to a subordinate officer and can be exercised by Manager, N.E.F.him only in the manner prescribed by the Constitution.

The short but difficult question · is whether r. 148 of the Indian· Railway Establishment Code, (1) (19611 2 S.C.R. 679. • • - - ' 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 733 Vol. I (1951) and r. 149 of the revised edition of the 1963 said Code of the year 1959 replacing r. 148 of the -- Code of 1951 edition impinge upon the constitu- Mori Ram Deka tional safeguard given to a person holding a civil etc. post under the Union Government under Art. 311(2) v. of the Constitution. While Art. 311(2) of the Comti- General tution prohibits the State from dismissing or removing Manager, N.E.F. or reducing in rank a civil servant until he has been Railways, given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause Maligaon, against the action proposed to be taken in regard Pandu, etc. to him, rr. 148 and 149 of the said Code in effect, - enable the Government to terminate his services Subba Rao J. after issuing the prescribed notice thereunder. Prima facie the said rules are in conflict with Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. Broadly stated, the contention of the State is that a Union civil servant holds his office during the pleasure of the President, that Art. 311 is not really a limitation on the exercise of that pleasure, that it only prescribes safeguards against the imposition on him of three unmerited speci- fied penalties, viz., dismissal, removal and reduction in rank, and that the termination of his services for a reason other than misconduct personal to the civil servant is not comprehended by any of the said penal- ties. The further argument is that the \"doctrine of pleasure\" implies that a civil servant has no right to an office even in a case where he has a substantive lien on a post and that in any event he has none when there is a specific rule that his services can be terminated after the prescribed notice. This Bench of seven Judges has been constituted to steer clear of conflicting observations, if any, found in the judgments of thif Court and to arrive at a conclusion of its own unhampered by such ob- servations. I would, therefore, proceed to consider the relevant provisions in accordance with the natural tenor of the expressions used therein and then to scrutinize whether any of my conclm ions would be in conflict with any of the decisions of this Court. At the outset I must make it clear that I propose to confine my discussion only to the question of terrni- 734 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [ 1964) 1963 nation of services of a permanent civil servant. None . -- of the observations I may make is intended to have Mot1 Ram Deka any bearing on the question of termination of the etc.. services of other categories of servants. v. General As the argument of the learned Additional Soli- Manager, N.E.F. citor-General is based upon the doctrine of pleasure, Railways it would be convenient at the outset to ascertain Maligaon' the precise scope of the doctrine in the context of . Pandu, et;. the Indian Constitution. Article 309 is subject to the provisions of the Subba Rao 1· Constitution and, therefore, is subject to Art. 310 thereof. Article 311 imposes two limitations on the doctrine of pleasure declared in Art. 310. The gist of the said provisions is this: Under Art. 309 of the Constitution the appropriate Legislature may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or any State; and until provision in that behalf is made, the President or such person as he may direct may make rules regulating the recruitment and condi- tions of service of persons appointed to the said services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union. In its ordinary meaning the expression \"conditions of service\" takes in also the tenure of a civil servant. Under Art. 310, such a civil servant holds office during the pleasure of the President; but Art. 311 imposes two conditions to be satisfied before a civil servant can be dismissed, or removed or reduced in rank, namely, (i)he shall not be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank by an authority subor- dinate to that by which he was appointed, and (ii) he shall be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in re- gard to him. A combined reading of these provisions indicates that the rules made under Art. 309 are subject to the doctrine of pleasure; and that the doctrine of pleasure is itself subject to two limitations imposed thereon under Art. 311. This tenure at pleasure is a concept borrowed from English law, though it has been modified to suit the Indian conditions, ' • ~ J \"- ( ... f 5 S.C.R. /l SUPREME COURT REPORTS 735 ' . ...,,. ' l The English law on the doctrine of tenure at pleasure 1963 has now become fairly crystallized. Under the English --- law, all servants of the Crown. hold office during Moti Ram Deka the pleasure of the Crown. The right to dismiss etc. at pleasure is an implied term in every contract of General employment under the Crown. This doctrine is not Manager, N.E.F. based upon any prerogative of the Crown but on Railways, public policy. If the terms of appointment defi- Maligaon, nitely prescribe a tenure for good behaviour or ex- Pandu, etc. pressly provide for a power to determine for a cause, such an implication of a power to dismiss at pleasure Subba Rao J. is excluded, and an Act of Parliament can abrogate or amend the said doctrine of public policy in the same way as it can do in respect of any other part of com- mon law. (see The State of U.P. v. Babu Ram Upadhya (1) • Section 96-B of the Government of India Act, 1915, for the first time in 1919, by an amendment, statutorily recognized this doctrine, but it was made subject to a condition that no person in the service might be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed. Section 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935, imposed another limitation, namely, that a reasonable opportunity of show ng cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to a person must be given to him. But neither of the two Acts empowered the appropriate Legislature to make a law abolishing or amending the said doctrine. The Constitution of India practically incorporated the provisions of s. 240 and s. 241 of the Government of India Act, 1935, in Arts. 309 and 310. The English doctrine has been enlarged in one direction and restricted in another: while Parliament has no power to deprive the President of his pleasure, the said pleasure is made subject to two limitations embodied in Art. 311. The English concept is considerably modified to suit the conditions of our country. It is, therefore, not correct to say that Art. 311 is not a limitation on the power of the Presi- dent to terminate the services of a Union civil servant at his pleasure. To accept the argument that the (1) [1961] 2 S.C.R. 679, 696. 736 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [ 1964] 1963 relevant expression in Art. 311 shall be so construed as . to give full sway to the doctrine is to ignore the limi- Moti Ram Dekatations on that doctrine. Both Art. 310 and Art. etc. 311 shall be read together and, if so read, it is mani- v. fest that the said doctrine is subject to the said two General conditions. Manager, N.E.F. Railways, Maligaon, Pandu, etc. Subba Rao J. What is the scope of the relevant words, \"dismis- sed\" and \"removed\" in Art. 311 of the Constitution? The general rule of mterpretation which is common to statutory provisions as well as to constitutional provisions is to find out the expressed intention of the makers of the said provisions from the words of the provisions themselves. It is also equally well-settled that, without doing violence to the language used, a constitutional provision shall receive a fair, liberal and progressive construction, so that its true objects might be promoted. Article 311 uses two well-known expressions, \"dismissed\" and \"removed\". The Article does not, expressly or by necessary impli- cation, indicate that the dismissal or removal of a Government servant must be of a particular category. As the said Article gives protection and safeguard to a Government servant, who will otherwise be at the mercy of the Government, the said words shall ordi- narily be given a liberal or at any rate their natural meaning, unless the said Article or other Articles of the Constitution, expressly or by necessary impli- cation, restrict their meaning. J do not see any indi- cation anywhere in the Constitution which compels the Court to reduce the scope of the protection. The dictionary meaning of the word \"dismiss\" is \"to let go; to relieve from duty''. The word \"remove\" means \"to discharge, to get rid off, to dismiss\". In their ordinary parlance, therefore, the said words mean nothing more or less than the termination of a person's office. The effect of dismissal or removal of one from his office is to discharge him from that office. In that sense, the said words comprehend every termination of the services of a Government servant. Article 311 (2) in effect lays down that before the ser- vices of a Government servant are so terminated, , ' ' ... • 5 S.C.R. SlJPREME COURT REPORTS 737 he must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing 1963 cause against such a termination. There is no justi- - fication for placing any limitation on the said ex- Moti Ram Deka pressions, such as that the dismissal or removal should etc. have been the result of an enquiry in regard to the Ge~eral Government servant's misconduct. The attempt to Manager, N.E.F. imply the said limitation is neither warranted by the Railways, expressions used in the Article or by the reason given, Ma/igaon namely, that otherwise there would be no point in Pandu, etc. giving him an opportunity to defend himself. If · this argument be correct, it would lead to an extra- Subba Rao J ordinary result, namely, that a Government servant who has been guilty of misconduct would be entitled to a \"reasonable opportunity\" whereas an honest Government servant could be dismissed without any such protection. In one sense the conduct of a party may be relevant to punishment; ordinarily punish- ment is meted out for misconduct, and if there is no misconduct there could not be punishment. Punish- ment is, therefore, correlated to misconduct, both in its positive and negative aspects. That is to say, punishment could be sustained if there was misconduct and could not be meted out if there was no miscon- duct. Reasonable opportunity given to a Government servant enables him to establish that he does not deserve the punishment, because he has not been guilty of misconduct. That apart, a Government servant may be removed or dismissed for many other reasons, such as retrenchment, abolition of post, compulsory retirement and others. If an oppor- tunity is given to a Government servant to show cause against the proposed action, he may plead and es- tablish that either there was no genuine retrench- ment or abolition of posts or that others should go before him. Now let me see whether the history of this constitutional provision countenances any such limi- tation on the meaning of the said expressions. As we have already noticed, the concept of tenure at pleasure was first introduced in the Government of India Act, 1919. Under s. 96-B of that Act, 1/SCl/64-47 1963 Moti Ram Deka etc. v, General Manager, N.E.F. Railways, Maligaon Pandu, etc. Subba Rao J. 738 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] \"(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of rules made thereunder, every person m the civil service of the Crown in India holds office during His Majesty's pleasure, and may be emplo- yed in any manner required by a proper authority within the scope of his duty, but no person in that service may be dismissed by any authority ·subordinate to that by which he was appointed ... \" It will be seen that under this section the said concept was introduced subject to a condition; it may also be noticed that the section used only one word \"dismissed\". In England, under that doctrine, ser- vices of a Government servant, whether he is a perma- nent or a temporary servant, can be terminated without any cause whether he is guilty of misconduct or not. Therefore, when the word \"dismissed\" is used in s. 96-B of the Act in the context of the exercise of His Majesty's pleasure, that word must have been used in the natural meaning it bears, i.e. ter- minated. But that section was subject to the provisions of the rules made under that Act. In exercise of the power conferred under the Act on the Secretary of State for T ndia in Council, he framed certain rules in December 1920 and with subsequent modifications they were published on May 27, 1930. The said rules were designated as the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules. Rule 49 of those Rules provided for certain penalties and cl. (6) thereof dealt with \"Removal from the civil service of the Crown, which does not disqua- lify from future employment'', and cl. (7) pro- vided for dismissal from the civil service of the Crown, \"which ordinarily disqualified from future employment\". The explanation to that rule read thus: The termination of employment:- (a) of a person appointed on probation during or at the end of the period of probation, in accordance with the terms of the appoint- ment and the rules governing the probationary service; or ·· r - - .. - .;. . .,.,.._- 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 739 (b) of a temporary Government servant appoin- 1963 ted otherwise than under contract, in accor- dance with rule 5 of the Central Civil Services Moti Ram Deka (Temporary Service) Rules, 1949; or etc. (c) of a person engaged under a accordance with the terms of does not amount to removal within the meaning of this rule 55.\" v, contract, in General his ~ont_ract Manager, N.E.F. or d1sm1ssal Railways, rule or of Maligaon, The explanation makes it clear that the three speci- fied categories of termination covered by the expla- nation would amount to dismissal or removal but for the explanation. That is to say, the expression \"termination\" is synonymous with the term \"dismissal\" or \"removal\". Rule 55 of the Rules provided a machinery for dismissing or removing or reducing in rank a Government servant; he should be given thereunder an adequate opportunity to defend him- self. Then came the Government of India Act, 1935. In s. 240 thereof, the expression used was \"dismissed\" and that term, in the context of the exer- cise of His Majesty's pleasure, could have meant only \"termination\" of services, though in view of the explanation to r. 49 of the Rules quoted above, the three specified categories of termination mentioned in the explanation might, by construction, be excluded from the natural meaning of the word \"dismissal\". Then we come to Art. 311 of the Constitution, which with certain modifications incorporated the provisions of s. 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935. It introduced the expression \"removed\" in addition to the word \"dismissed\" presumably inspired by rr. 49 and 55 of the Rules. The natural meaning of the said terms takes in every act of termination of service; but, if construed with the help of r. 49 of the Rules, their meaning may be cut down by excluding the three categories of termination covered by the explanation in the manner prescribed therein. If the termination was otherwise than that prescribed therein, it would still be dismissal or removal. If so, the history of the constitutional provisions may Pandu, etc. Subba.Rao J. 740 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964) 1963 lead to the conclusion that though the words \"dis- missed\" and \"removed\" are words of widest connota- Moti Ram Deka ti on, namely \"termination\" of service of any category etc. held under the Union, they were used in the limited·· v. sense they bear in r. 49 of the Rules, that is to say General termination of employment excluding the three cate- Manager, N.E.F. gories mentioned in the explanation. So far the Railways, words \"removed\" and \"dismissed\" are concerned, Ma/igaon r. 49 shows that there is no appreciable difference Pandu, etc. between the two except in the matter of future employment; and Art. 311, presumably, copied the Subba Rao J. two words from r. 49. ;. Therefore, whether the natural and dictionary meanings of the words \"dismissal\" and \"removal\" were adopted or the limited meanings given to those words by r. 49 were accepted, the result, so far as a permanent employee was concerned, would be the same, namely that in the case of termination of ser- vices of a Government servant outside the three cate- gories mentioned in the explanation, it would be dis- missal or removal within the meaning of Art. 311 of the Constitution with the difference that in the former the dismissed servant would not be disquali- fied from future employment and in the latter ordinarily he would be disqualified from such employment. ' If so, it follows that if the services of a permanent Government servant, which fall outside the three categories mentioned in the explanation, were termi- nated, he would be entitled to protection under Art. 311 (2) of the Constitution. With this background let me now scrutinise the leading judgment of this Court on the subject, namely, Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India 0>. That was a case of reversion of a Government servant who was officiating in Class II Service as Assistant Superintendent, Railway Telegraphs, to his substan- tive post in Class III Service. This Court, speaking through Das C.J., gave an exhaustive treatment to the scope of Art. 311 (2) of the Constitution, parti- (1) [1958] S,C.R. 828. r - - • - Y' , ..... _\"' ,/ 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 741 cularly with reference to the meaning of the expressions \"dismissed\", \"removed\" or \"reduced in rank\" found therein. A careful reading of the judgment shows 1963 that this Court has heavily relied upon r. 49 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Moti Ram Deko Rules, and its explanation, and attempted to give etc. a legal basis for the said provisions. On that basis, v. having considered the different aspects of the problem, General the Court has laid down the following two tests, Manager, N.E.F. at p. 863, to ascertain whether a person is dismissed Railways, or removed within the meaning of Art. 311 of the Maligaon Constitution; (1) Whether the servant had a right to Pandu, etc. the post or the rank or (2) whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore re- Subba Rao J. ferred to i.e., loss of pay and allowances, loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion. If an officer had a right to a post or rank and if the termination of his services deprived him of that right, the said termination would be dismissal or removal as punishment. So too, if the termination had the effect of the officer being visited with evil consequences, then whatever may be the phraseology used for putting an end to his services, it would be dismissal as punish- ment. The motive operating on the mind of the autho- rity concerned or the machinery evolved or the method adopted to put an end to his services are not relevant in considering the question whether he was dismissed, if he had a right to the office or if he had been visi- ted with evil consequences, though the said circum- stances may have some relevance as other decisions of this Court disclose, in ascertaining whether he was discharged with a stigma attached to him. While conceding that this decision does not in terms speci- fically lay down that even in the case of a person holding a permanent post, if there was an appropriate term in the conditions of service that his services could be terminated by notice, Art. 311 of the Consti- tution would not be attracted, it is contended that raison d'etre of the decision and some passages therein lead to that conclusion. Some of the passages re- lied upon may be extracted: 742 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964) 1963 At pp. 857-858: Moti Ram Deka ·etc. v. General Manager, N.E.F. Railways, Maligaon, Pandu, etc. Subba Rao J. \"It has already been said that where a person is appointed substantively to a permanent post in Government service, he normally acquires a right to hold the post until under the rules, he attains the age of superannuation or is com- pulsorily retired and in the absence of a contract express or implied, or a service rule he cannot be turned out of his post unless he is guilty of misconduct, negligence, inefficiency or other dis- qualifications and appropriate proceedings are taken under the service rules read with A rt. 311(2).\" At p. 862: \"As already stated if the servant has got a right to continue in the post, then, unless the contract of employment or the rules provide to the con- trary, his services cannot be terminated other- wise than for misconduct, negligence, inefficiency or other good and sufficient cause.\" These passages certainly lend support to the argument of the learned counsel, but the qualifying clauses on which reliance is placed are only incidental obser- vations. The main principles relevant to the present enquiry were laid down by the Court clearly and pre- cisely at p. 860, thus: \"Shortly put, the principle is that when a servant has right to a post or to a rank either under the terms of the contract of employment, express or implied, or under the rules governing the con- ditions of his service, the termination of the service of such a servant or his reduction to a lower post is by itself and prima facie a punish- ment, for it operates as a forfeiture of his right to hold that post or that rank and to get the emoluments and other benefits attached thereto.\" The following observation further pinpoints the principle; \"One test for determining whether the termi- nation of the service of a government servant - .• - -- .. - , .. ,, SS.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS is by way of punishment is to ascertain the servant, but for such termination, 743 whether had the 1963 Moti Ram Deka right to hold the post.\" This decision, therefore, clearly Jays down, without e~c. any ambiguity, that if a person has a right to hold Gen~ral office un~er . the servi_ce rul~s or under a contract, Manager, N.E.F. the termmat10n of hts services would attract Art; R ilways 311 of the Constitution. It also lays down that a ua l\"gaon' Person holding· a substantive lien on a permanent a' ' Pandu, etc. post has a right to such office. It does not say, expres- sly or by necessary implication, that even if a person Subba Rao J. is deprived of such a right, it will not be punishment, unless it is inflicted for misconduct in the manner prescribed by the service rules. Learned Additional Solicitor-General further re- lied upon the decisions of this Court· holding that a rule empowering the Government to compulsorily retire a permanent Government servant before the age of superannuation did not violate Art. 311 of the Constitution and contended that, on parity of reasoning, the impugned rules should likewise be valid. It was asked, with c;9nsiderable force, what relevant distinchun there could be between the said two categories of rules in the context of the question whether the termination of services was dismissal or not within the meaning of Art. 311 of the Constitution? Ih the case of a Government servant, the argument proceed- ed, in eit1'er case he was deprived of his title to office and, therefore, both cases were equally covered by the principle laid down in Dhingra's case<t). This argument certainly deserves serious consideration. The relevant rules pertaining to compulsory re- tirement of a permanent Government servant con- sidered by this Court in the various decisions relied upon by learned counsel may now be.· noticed. In Shyam Lal's case<2 > which is the sheet-anchor of the appellants' argument, the rule under considera- tion was Note 1 to Art. 465-A of the Civil Services Regulations. The said Note read: {l) [1958) S.C.R. 828 [2) [1955) 1 S.C.R, 26 744 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964) 1963 Moti Rnm Deka \"Government retains an absolute right to retire any officer after he has completed twenty-five years qualifying service without giving any rea- sons, and no claim to special compensation on this account will be entertained.

This right will not be exercised except when it is in the public interest to dispense with the further services of a Government servant such as on account of inefficiency or dishonesty.\" Rule 3 of the Railway Services (Safeguarding of Na- tional Security) Rules, 1949, was under consideration in Balakotaiah v. The Union of India<2> and it read: \"A member of the Railway Service who, in the opinionofthecompetentauthorityis engaged in or is reasonably suspected to be engaged in subversive activities, or is associated with others in subversive activities in such manner as to raise doubts about his. reliability, may be compulsorily retired from service, or have his service terminated by the competent authority after he has been given due notice or pay in lieu of such notice in accor- dance with the terms of his service agreement: Provided that a member· of the Railway Service shall not be retired or have his service so terminated unless the competent authority is· satisfied that his retention in public service is prejudicial to national security, and unless, (I) (1958] S.C.R. 571.

J. - - 746 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 The rule in Dalip Singh' s caseOl gives a very wide --- power to the State to retire any of its employees on pen- Moti Ram Deka sion on political or other reasons before the age etc. of superannuation. Jn short the rules dealt with in .v. the first three decisions expressly conferred an absolute General power on the appropriate authority to terminate Manager, N.E.F. the services of a Government servant for misconduct, Railways, and the rule in the fourth decision went further and Maligaon, enabled the appropriate authority to dismiss the Pandu, etc. servant for any reason. It may also be noticed that in Doshi' s caes<ZJ this Court expressed the view that Subba Rao J. \"when there is no rule fixing the age of compulsory retirement or if there is one and the servant is retired before the age prescribed therein, then that can be regarded only as dismissal or removal within Art. 311 (2) of the Constitution\". The emphasis appears to be more on the existence of a rule of compulsory retirement than on the character of the termination itself. But this reservation was not accepted by the Court in Dalip Singh' s case<1J, that is to say, the emp- hasis is shifted to the existence of a rule of termina- tion detracting from the permanency of the post. Pausing here a moment, I ask myself the question whether these decisions can be reconciled with the aforesaid principles laid down in Dhingra' s case(3). In Dhingra' s case this Court held that a termination of the services of a Government servant, who. has substantive lien on a permanent post, that is to say a title to his office, is dismissal or removal within the meaning of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. Jn the aforesaid three decisions the Government servant concerned had substantive lien on a permanent post, but he was compulsorily retired before the age of superannuation depriving him of his title to the post. It is neither the phraseology used in respect of nor the nomenclature given to the act of termination of service that is material but the legal effect of the action taken that is decisive in considering the question whether a Government servant is dismissed or not. Whether the services of a permanent Government servant are (!) (1961] I S. C. R. 88 (2) [1958] S. C. R. 571 (3) [1958) S.C.R. 828. •· • • • 5 S.C.R.

If in the former case it amounts to dismissal, General in the latter case it must be equally so. I would, Manager, N.E.F. prefer the principle laid down in Dhingra' s case OJ in Railways, the matter of termination of the services of a per- Maligaon, manent Government servant to that laid down in the Pandu, etc. said other decisions. Rule 148 of the Railway Establishment Code, Subba Rao J. Vol. I, was considered both in Balakotaiah's case (2) and in Jeewan Ram's caseOl: in the former, though there were some observations in support of the appel- lants' contention, the question of construction of the rule was expressly left open, and in the latter, though the Government servant concerned was dis- charged under that rule, the decision proceeded on the basis that he was expressly removed for mis- conduct. A number of decisions of the High Courts are cited. I have gone through them carefully. I am not referring to them in detail, as, though some of the judgments contain instructive discussion on the· subject, they practically extended the principle of Shyam Lal's case(4) and held that the termination of service, such as under r. 148(3), was not dismissal within the meaning of Art. 311 of the constitution. As, in my view, Shyam Lal's case must yield to Dhingra's case, a further discussion of the said decisions is not called for. The effect of the two rules is the same; the difference is only superficial, which lies more in clever · drafting than in their content. Take for instance the following two rules: (i) the Government may termi- nate the services of a permanent Government servant at any time, or after a specified period but before the normal superannuation age, by way of compulsory retirement; and (i1) the Government may· terminate {I) [1958] ~CCR. 828-- ~ (2) [1958] s. c.

Arbitrariness is writ large on Moti Ram Deka both the rules: both the rules enable the Government etc. to deprive a permanent civil servant of his office v. without enquiry. Both violate Art. 311(2) of the General Constitution. Both must be bad or none at all. Manager, N.E.F. The following principles emerge from the afore- Railways, said discussion. A title to an office must be dis- Maligaon tinguished from the mode of its termination. If Pandu, etc. a person has title to an office, he will continue to have it till he is dismissed or removed therefrom. Terms Subba Rao J. of statutory rules may provide for conferment of a title to an ofhce and also for the mode of terminating it. If under such rules a person acquires title to an office, whatever mode of termination is prescribed, whatever phraseology is used to describe it, the termi- nation is neither more nor less than a dismissal or removal from service; and that situation inevitably attracts the provisions of Art. 311 of the Constitu- tion. The argument that the mode of termination prescribed derogates from the title that otherwise would have been conferred on the employee mixes up two clear concepts of conferment of title and the mode of its deprivation. Article 311 is a constitu- tional protection given to Government servants, who have title to office, against arbitrary and summary dismissal. It follows that Government cannot by rule evade the provisions of the said Article. The parties cannot also contract themselves out of the constitutional provision. Once that principle is accepted the cases dealing with compulsory retirement before the age of super- annuation cannot also fall outside the scope of Art. 311 of the Constitution. Age of superannuation is , common to all permanent civil servants: it depends upon an event that inevitably happens by passage of time, unless the employee dies earlier or resigns from the post. It does not depend on the discretion of the employer or the employee; it is for the benefit of the employee who earns a well-earned rest with or without pensionary benefits for the rest of his life; it has, by custom and by convention, become 4 - ] r ~ ·! - )\" • -<' 1 ~· 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 749 an inextricable incident of Government service; and 1963 it is an incident of a permanent post. Notwithstanding . -- the rule fixing an age of superannuation, a person Mott Ram Deka appointed to such a post acquires title to it. The etc. same cannot be said of a compulsory retirement v. before the age of superannuation. It is not an inci- G~neral dent of the tenure; it does not work automatically; Manager, N.E.F. it is not conceived in the interest of the employee; Railways, it is a mode of terminating his employment at the Maligaon discretion of the appointing authority. In effect, Pandu, etc. whatever may be the phraseology used in terminating the services of a Government employee, it is punish- Subba Rao J. ment imposed on him, for it not only destroys his title but also inevitably carries with it a stigma. such a termination is only dismissal or removal within the meaning of Art. 311 of the Constitution. I would, therefore, with greatest respect, follow the principle laid down in Dhingra' s case(lJ in respect of permanent servants in preference to that accepted by Shyam Lat's case (2) and the subsequent decisions following it. Now let me turn to the relevant rules of the Indian Railway Establishment Code, hereinafter called the Code. The Code is in two volumes. The first volume embodies all rules governing the service conditions of railway servants with the exception of those rules which correspond to the Fund.amental Rules, Supplementary Rules, Pension Rules and the Civil Service Regula- tions applicable generally to all civil servants under the Government of India. The excepted rules are included in Vol. II of the Code. Fundamental Rules embodied in Vol. II of the Code describe, inter alia, the cadre-strength, the different posts in the cadre and the nature of the appointments made in respect of such posts. Broadly the posts are divided as permanent, officiating, temporary and for definite periods. Rule 2003 (14) defines lien to mean the title of a railway servant to hold substantively either immediately or on the termination of a period or periods of absence, a permanent post, including a tenure post, to which he has been appointed substan- (1) [1958] S. C.R. 828. (2) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 26. 750 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [ 1964) 1963 · tively. Under r. 2006, \"Unless in any case it be other- . -- wise provided in these Rules, a railway servant on Mot• Ram Deka substantive appointment to any permanent post acquires etc. a lien on that post and ceases to hold any lien _ v. previously acquired on any other post\". Under General _ r. 2009, \"A railway servant's lien on a post may, Manager, N.E.F. in no circumstances be terminated even with his ' ' Railways, consent, if the result will be to leave him without a Maligaon, lien or a suspended lien upon a permanent post.\" Pandu, etc. Rule 2042 provides that the pay and allowances of a railway servant who is removed or dismissed from Subba Rao J. service ceases from the date of the order of removal or dismissal. Rule 2046, under the heading \"Compul- sory Retirement\", fixes the age of superannuation for different categories of service. These rules clearly lay down that a railway servant on a substantive appointment to a permanent post acquires a lien on that post and he does not lose it till he attains the age of superannuation or is dismissed or removed in the manner prescribed; that is, he acquires a title to hold substantively a permanent post. It is not of much. relevance to give any particular nomenclature to that post. It may riot be a life tenure. It may not also be a permanent post in the literal sense of the term, but it confers a title to that post with all the advantages appertaining to that post and ordinarily it comes to an end only on the incumbent attaining the age of superannuation, with or without pensionary benefits. Briefly stated, the aforesaid Fundamental Rules embodied in Vol. II of the Code create offices of stability and security which for all practical pur- poses are permanent posts. Jf so, the termination of services of such a servant can only -be dismissal or removal, for he will be deprived of his title to the said office. If that was the legal position, for the reasons already given, the said r. 148(3) and r. 149, conferring a power on the appointing authority to remove such a permanent servant on notice would infringe the constitutional protection given to a Government servant under Art. 311 of the Constitu- tion. A permanent post and such rules cannot stand together: the latter must inevitably yield to the former. ,_ • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 751 I, therefore, hold that r. 148(3) and r. 149 of · 1963 the Railway Establishment Code, being violative -- of the provisions of Arts. 14 and 311 of the Constitu- Moti Ram Deka tion are void and unenforceable. etc. In the result, I agree that Civil Appeals Nos. v. 711 to 713 of 1962 and Civil Appeal No. 714 of 1962 General should be allowed with costs and that Civil Appeals Manager, N.E.F. Nos. 837 to 839 of 1963 should be dismissed with Railways, costs. Ma/igaon DAS GUPTA J.-The principal question raised in Pandu, etc. the four appeals which have been numbered 711 t6 714 of 1962 is as regards the validity of Rule 148 (3) of Das Gupta J. the Indian Railway Establishment Code in respect of certain non-pensionable railway servants that their services shall be liable to termination on notice for the period as prescribed therein. The appellants- all railway employees-whose services had been ter- minated on notice in accordance with the above provision and who have failed to obtain relief against the orders of termination challenge the validity of this provision on two grounds. Their first contention is that this Rule in providing for termination of service on mere notice contravenes the provisions of Art. 311(2) of the Constitution; secondly, it is contended that the Rule violates Art. 14 of the Constitution. It will be necessary to examine these two grounds separately. Is the termination as provided for in the above provision, in Rule 148 (3) 'removal' or 'dismissal' within the meaning of Art. 311 (2) of the Constitu- tion? That is the question that falls to be answered for deciding the first grounds. To answer this again we have to determine first the connotation of the two words 'removal' and 'dismissal' as used in Art. 311(2). In my opinion, this matter is completely covered by· numerous decisions of this Court. Before turning to the decisions however it will be convenient to examine the matter in the context in which Art. 311 (2) appears in the Constitution and also the historical background of the protection afforded thereby. For this purpose it is necessary first to consider the three Articles of the Constitu- I 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 753 Union or a State, is appointed under this Consti- 1963 tution to hold such a post may, if the President -- or the Governor or the Rajpramukh as the case Moti Ram Deka may be, deems it necessary in order to secure the etc. services of a person having special qualifications, v. provide for the payment to him of compensation, General if before the expiration of an agreed period that post Manager, N.E.F is abolished or he is, for reasons not connected with Railways, any misconduct on his part, required to vacate Maligaon that post. Pandu, etc. 311. (1) No person who is a member of a Das Gupta J. civil service of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a State or holds a civil post under the Union or a State shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed. (2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him. Provided that this clause shall not apply- ( a) where a person is dismissed or removed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge; (b) where an authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by that authority in writing it is not reasonably practicable to give to that person an opportunity of showing cause; or (c) where the President or Governor or Rajpramukh, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to give to that person such an opportunity. (3) If any question arises whether it is reason- ably practicable to give to any person an oppor- tunity of showing cause under clause (2), the decision thereon of the authority empowered l/SCI/64-49 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COlJRT REPORTS 755 cannot reasonably be included within the words 1963 dismissal or removal. Take for instance the case where a government servant resigns his post but Moti Ram Deka the resignation is not under the rules effective be- etc. fore it has been accepted by his superiors. Here, v. termination results only when the superior officer General accepts the resignation. It may be correct to say Manager, N.E.F. that thereby he terminates the service. But it could Railways, not reasonably be said that the superior officer has Maligaon, removed the servant from service or dismissed him Pandu, etc. from service. Such removal or dismissal was not necessary at all because of the resignation. Take Das Gupta J. again the case of a servant who has been appointed to an office for a period of three years. When the three-year period ends he is asked to go. There is termination of service. But nobody would say that the superior officer by asking him to go at the end of the period had dismissed him or removed him from service. The real question however is not so much as what in common parlance would be under- stood to be the dismissal or removal but what· the Constitution intended by these words. In this connection it will be helpful to examine the use of the words dismissal and removal in the earlier Constitution Acts. The Charter Act of 1793 mentions in s. 36 that nothing in this Act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend to preclude or take away the power of the Court of Directors of the said Company from removing or recalling any of the officers or servants of the said Company, but that the said Court shall and may at all times have full liberty to remove, recall, or dismiss any of such officers or servants, at their will and pleasure, in the like manner as if this Act had not been passed. Section 35 made it lawful to and for the King's Majesty, his heirs and successors, by any writing or instrument under him or their sign· manual, countersigned by the President of the Board of Commissioners for the affairs of India, to remove or recall any person or person holding any office, employment, or commission, civil or military, under the said United Company 756 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 in India for the time being. In the Charter Act of 1833, similar provisions were enacted in ss. 74 · Moti Ram Deklland 75. Section 74 make it lawful \"for His Majesty etc. by any Writing under His Sign Manual, counter- v. signed by the President of the said Board of Com- General missioners, to remove or dismiss any person holding Manager, N.E.F. any office, employment or commission, civil or mili- Railways, tary, under the said Company in India, and to vacate Maligaon, any Appointment or Commission of any person to Pandu, etc. any such office or employment.\" .Das Gupta J. Section 75 ran thus:- \"Provided always, and be it enacted, that nothing in this Act contained shall take away the Power of the said Court of Directors to remove or dismiss any of the officers or servants of the said Company but that the said Court shall and may at all Times have full Liberty to remove or dismiss any of such officers or ser- vants at their will and pleasure .......... \" When the Act of 1858 transferred the govern- ment of India to Her Majesty the Queen of England section 38 of the Act provided that. \"Any writing under the Royal Sign Manual removing or dismissing any person holding any office employment or commission, civil or military in India, of which, if this Act had not been passed, a copy would have been required to be transmitted or delivered within eight days after being signed by Her Majesty to the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Court of Directors, shall, in lieu thereof, be communicated within the time aforesaid to the Secretary of State in Council.\" It seems to me that in making these statutory provisions as regards dismissal or removal of public servants the British Parliament had in mind those servants only who had acquired such a right to the post under their conditions of service that but for such statutory provisions their dismissal or removal would have been unlawful. If their service was terminable by the ordinary law of the land there '•. . ( .• •.. [ 5 S.C.R. STJPREME COURT REPORTS 757 would have been no need in s. 36 of the 1793 Act 1963 or s. 75 of the 1833 Act to speak of the right 0of the -·-· Court of Directors of the Company to remove or Moti Ram Deka · dismiss the Company's officers or servants at their etc. will and pleasure. It is clear that by these provisions v. the British Parliament was emphasizing the right General of the Court of Directors of the Company to remove Manager, N.E.F. or dismiss such servants whose services would not Railways, have been terminable under the ordinary law of master Ma/igaon, and servant. It is also legitimate to read the provisions Pandu, etc. making it lawful for the King of England to remove or dismiss the Company's servants (s). 35 in the Charter Das Gupta J . Act of 1793 and s. 75 of the Charter Act of 1833) as intended to terminate the service of the same class of servants, viz., those whose services were not ter- minable under the ordinary law of the land .. In the light of this legislative history, the words removal and dismissal in s. 38 of the Act of 1858 and thereafter in the Government of India Act, 1915 (Section 95 and s. 96B) cannot but be read also to mean termination of service of such servants only who would not have been liable to termination under the ordinary law of master and servant. In other words, only those servants who by their terms and conditions of their appointment to the service had acquired a right to continue for a particular period which could not under the ordinary law be put an end to were intended to get the benefit of these provisions as regards dismissal or removal. By the time the Government of India Act, 1935, came tc be enacted by Parliament rules had been framed . by the Secretary of State in Council under s. 96B of the Government of India Act, in which these words, removal and dismissal, were used. Among the rules framed under this section in 1924 was Rule XIII, which was in these words:- \"Without prejudice to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, the Local Government may for good and sufficient reasons:- (1) Censure (2) Withhold promotion from 1963 Moti Ram Deka etc. v. 758 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (3) Reduce to a lower post (4) Suspend (5) Remove, or (6) Dismiss [1964) General any ofhcer holding a post in a provincial or subordi- Manager, N.E.F. nate service or a special appointment.\" Railways, . Maligaon In the fresh set of rules framed in 1930 Rule Pandu, et;. 49 took !he place of Rule XIII of the earlier Rules and was m these words:- Das Gupta J. \" R. 49. The following penalties, may, for good and sufficient reason and as hereinafter provided, be imposed upon members of the services comprised in any of the classes (1) to (SJ specified in Rule XIV namely:- (i) Censure, (ii) withholding of increments or promo· ti on (iii) reduction to a lower post or time-scale, or to a lower stage in a time-scale, (iv) recovery from pay of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss caused to Govern- ment by negligence or breach of orders, (v) suspension, (vi) removal from the civil service of the crown, which does not disqualify from · future employment, (vii) dismissal from the civil service of the crown, which ordinarily disqualifies from future employment. Explanation-The discharge- ( a) of a person appointed on probation, during the period of probation, (b) of a person appointed otherwise than under contract to hold a temporary appointment, on the expiration of the period of the appoint- ment, I ,, l . \\ ' l 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 759 ( c) of a person engaged under contract, in accordance with the terms of his contract, 1963 does not amount to removal or dismissal Moti Ram Deka within the meaning of this Rule.\" etc. These Rules show that the Secretary of State G v. 1 in Council considered removal and dismissal from M. ener~E F the service of the Crown only as penalties. Explana-· an;_g.~r, · · · tion to Rule 49 of the 1930 Rules also shows that ~' ~ays, discharge from service of a person who had not a/lgaon, acquired a right to the post was not considered to be Pandu, etc. removal or dismissal. When the British Parliament made special pro- vision in the Government of India Act, 1935 as re- gards removal or dismissal of persons in the civil service of the Crown it had before it not only the history of these words-removal and dismissal- in the Charter Act 1793, Charter Act of 1833, Govern- ment of India Act, 1858, the Government of India Act, 1915 but also these Rules framed by the Secretary of State in Council. · It is reawnable to think therefore that in making these special provisions in the 1935 Act the British Parliament proceeded on the basis that only termi- nations of service by way of punishment which could not have been inflicted under the ordinary law of master and servant would come within these words- removal and dismissal. Primarily such terminations by way of punishment could be made only in respect of those servants who had not acquired a right to continue in service. It might however be said that even where there was no such right and termination could have been effected therefore under the ordinary law of contract between master and servant any ter- mination which carried with it loss of benefits already acqmred, say, forfeiture of pension or of provident fund was also contemplated to come within these words. Termination in no other case could be said to be by way of punishment and in the light of the previous history of the use of the words-removal and dismissal-in connection with the civil servants of the crown it appears to be abundantly clear that Das Gupta/. 760 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964) • 1963 in the Government of India Act, 1935 the words removal and dismissal were not intended to include Moti Ram Deka such other terminations. e~c. When the Constitution was framed the provisions G · 1 as regards removal and dismissal as contained in M. ener~ E F s. 240 of the Government of India Act were embodied anager, · · •in Arts. 310 and 311 with practically little change. Railways, Nothing has been shown to us to indicate that the Maligaon, Pandu, etc. Constitution makers could have meant by these words-removal and dismissal-in Art. 311, anything Das Gupta J. different from what the British Parliament had intended to include under those words in the Government of India Act, 1935. ) The above consideration of the context and pre- vious legislative history leads to the conclusion that the words 'removal' or 'dismissal' in Art. 311 meant only such terminations of service where the servant had acquired a right to continue in the post which right was cut short by the termination and such other terminations even where there was no such right, as resulted in loss of acquired benefits. Turning now to the decided cases we find that the question now under consideration was fully discussed in this Court's decision in Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India(!). After an exhaustive discussion of appointments of Government servants tu a permanent or temporary post, substantively or on probation or on an officiating basis, and numerous rules of service in connection with such appointments, Das C.J. speaking for the majority of the Court recorded the conclusion thus:- \"It follows therefore that if the termination of service is sought to be brought about other- wise than by way of punishment, then the govern- ment servant whose service is so terminated cannot claim the protection of Art. 311(2).\" The learned Chief Justice went on to say:- \"The foregoing conclusion however does not solve the entire problem, for it has yet to (!) [1958] s.c.R. 829. I J ,· ' I • I 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 761 be ascertained as to when an order for the ter- 1963 mination of service is inflicted as and by way of -- punishment and when it is not. It has already Moti Ram Deka been said that where a person is appointed sub- etc. stantively to a permanent post in Government v. service, he normally acquires a right to hold General the post until under the rules, he attains the age of Manager, N.E.F. superannuation or is compulsorily retired, and Railways, in the absence of a contract express or implied, Maligaon, or a service rule, he cannot be turned out of his Pandu, etc. post unless the post itself is abolished or unless he is guilty of misconduct, negligence, inefficiency Das Gupta J. or other disqualifications and appropriate pro- ceedings are taken under the service rules read with Art. 311(2). Termination of service of such a servant so appointed must per se be a punishment, for it operates as a forfeiture of the servant's rights and brings about a pre- mature end of his employment. Again, where a person is appointed to a temporary post for a fixed term of say five years his service can- not, in the absence of a contract or a service rule permitting its premature termination be termi- nated before the expiry of that period unless he has been guilty of some misconduct, negligence, inefficiency or other disqualifications and appro- priate proceedings are taken under the rules read with Art. 311(2). The premature termi- nation of the service of a servant so appointed will prima facie be a dismissal or removal from service by way of punishment and so within the purview of Art. 311(2). At page 862, the learned Chief Justice again observed:- In short, if the termination of service is founded on the right flowing from· contract or the service rules then, prima facie, thr~ termination is not a punishment and carries with it no evil consequences and so Art. 311 is :10t attracted. But even if the Government har., by contract or under the rules, the right to• terminate the • > :> .. 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 763 It was pointed out that on compulsory retirement /963 an officer would not suffer any diminution of the accrued benefit and though in a wide sense the officer Moti Ram Deka might consider himself punished by the deprivation etc. of the chance of serving and getting his pay till he v. attains the age of superannuation and thereafter General to get an enhanced pension, there is clearly a distinc- Manager. N.E.F. tion between the loss of benefit already earned and· Railways, the loss of prospect of earning something more; Maligaon, where the officer did not lose the benefit already Pandu, etc. earned the same was not dismissal or removal. At page 42 of the Report the Court said:- Das Gupta J . \"Finally, Rule 49 of the Civil Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules clearly indicates that dismissal or removal is a punish- ment. This is imposed on an officer as a penalty. It involves loss of benefit already earned.\" In Doshi' s Case<l l the Court had to considtr an order of compulsory retirement made under Rule 165A of the Bombay Civil Service Rules as amended by the Saurashtra Government which gave the Govern- ment an absolute right to retire any government servant after he had completed 25 years of qualifying service or 50 years of age whatever his service without giving any reason. It was held that such an order was not 'removal' or 'dismissal' under Art. 311 of the Constitution. Speaking for the Court Venkata- rama Aiyar J. said:- \"Now the policy underlying Art. 311(2) is that when it is proposed to take action against a servant by way of punishment and that will entail forfeiture of benefits already earned by him, he should be heard and given an opportunity to show cause against the order. But that consideration can have no application where the order is not one of punishment and results in no loss of benefits already accrued, and in such a case there is no reason why the terms of em- ployment and the rules of service should not (1) [1958] S.C.R. 571. 1963 Moti Ram Deka etc. v. General Manager, N.E.F. Railways, Maligaon, Pandu, etc. Das Gupta J. I I 764 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] be given effect to. Thus, the real criterion for deciding whether an order terminating the services of a servant is one of dismissal or removal is to ascertain whether it involves any loss or benefits previously earned. Applying this test, an order under R. l 65A cannot be held to be one of dismissal or removal, as it does not en- tail forfeiture of the proportionate pension due for past services.\" Hartwell's Case nJ was one of termination of a temporary servant under the U.P. Subordinate Agri- cultural Service, who for some time served in a tempor- rary capacity in the U.P. Agricultural Service. He was first reverted to his original appointment in the Subordinate Agricultural Service by an order dated May 3, 1954 and later a notice dated September 13, 1954 was served on him terminating his services in the Subordinate Agricultural Service. The notice purported to be under Rule 25 CJ. 4 of the Subordinate Agricultural Service Rules. The Court held that the termination of the appellant's services under this rule did not amount to dismissal or removal within the meaning of Art. 311 as it was in accordance with the terms of the conditions of service applicable to the appellant. Imam J. speaking for the Court observed:- \"In principle, we cannot see any clear distinction between the termination of the servjces of a person under the terms of a contract governing him and the termination of his services in accor- dance with the terms of his conditions of service. The order complained against did not contravene the provisions of Art. 311 and was therefore a valid order.\" The proposition that it is not every termination of service of an employee that falls within the opera- tion of Art. 311 and that it is only when the order is by way of punishment that it is one of dismissal or removal was re-affirmed by this Court in Balakotich v. The Union of lndiaC3J. Reaffirming also the criteria indicated in Dhingar' s CaseC3J as to what amounted (1) [1958] S.C.R. 509. (2) [1958] S.C.R. 1052. (3) [1958] S. C. R. 829. .. -· - .. 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 765 to punishment for the purpose of Art. 311, Venkata- 1963 rama Aiyar J. speaking for the Court observed:- \" . Moti Ram Deka The question as to what would amount tc to punishment for the purposes of Art. 311 e v. · was also fully considere.d in Parshotam Lal G neral !Jhingra's. CaseOl. It was . ther~in held _that Mana eer, N.E.F. if a person ha~ a nght to contmue m otIJce either R!lways, under the service rules or. un~er a spe_c1al agi;-ee- Maligaon, ment, a premature termmat10n of his services p du tc would result in loss of benefits already earned an ' e · and accrued, that would also be punishment.\" Das Gupta J. Proceeding to apply this proposition to the facts of the case before it the Court said:- \"In the present case, the terms of employ- ment provide for the services being terminated on a proper notice, and so, no question of pre- mature termination arises. Rule 7 of the Security Rules preserves the rights of the employee to all the benefits of pension, gratuities and the like, to which they would be entitled under the rules. Thus, there is no forfeiture of benefits already acquired. It was stated for the appellants that a person who was discharged under the rules was not eligible for re-employment, and that that was punishment. But the appellants are unable to point to any rule imposing that disability. The order terminating services under R. 3 of the Securi- ty Rules stands on the same footing as an order of discharge under R. 148, and it is neither one of dismissal nor of removal within the meaning of Art. 311.\" The law as thus settled by this Court was again applied in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab.<2> Dalip Singh who had been Inspector-General of Police, PEPSU, was compulsorily retired from service by the Rajpramukh by an order dated August 18, 1950 which ran as follows:- \"His Highness the Rajpramukh is pleased to retire from service Sardar Dalip Singh, Inspector- (!) J195SJ s. c. R. 829. (2) [1961] 1 s.c.R. 88. 766 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1964] 1963 General of Police, PEPSU, (on leave) for ad- ministrative reasons with effect from the 18th Moti Ram Deka August, 1950.\" etc. The appellant brought his suit asking for a declara- v. tion that the order by which he was removed from General the post of Inspector-General of Police was un- Manager, N.E.F. constitutional, illegal, void, ultra vires and inoperative. Railways, Among the grounds on which this declaration was Maligaon, sought was that the compulsory retirement of the Pandu, etc. appellant which had been made under Regulation 278 of the Patiala State Regulations, was removal Das Gupta J. from service within the meaning of Art. 311 of the Constitution. Admittedly the requirements of Art. 311(2J had not been complied with in this case and so the question had to be decided whether such a retirement was removal or dismissal within the mean- ing of Art. 311. The question was answered by this Court in the negative for the reasons that the order did not amount to punishment because though an enquiry had been held against him the charges or imputations against him had not been made the condition of the exercise of the power of retirement and further because the officer was not losing the benefits he had already earned, as full pension was ordered to be paid. To emphasise the point that where compulsory retirement was in accordance with the rules of service it could not ordinarily be said to be by way of punishment, the Court pointed out that where a rule of service provided for compulsory retirement at any age whatsoever irrespective of the length of service put in, a retirement under such a. rule would not be regarded as dismissal or removal. An observation in Doshi's Case OJ which might appear to indic~te otherwise was not followed- it being pointed out that in Doshi' s Case this matter did not fall to be considered. Under Rule 278 the State reserved to itself the right to retire any of its employees on pension on political or on other reasons. It did not mention any particular age for retirement under this Rule. Care was taken in this case to mention that if the rule would result in loss (1) [1958] S. C.R. 571, \" - 768 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1964] 1963 who have entered government service on or after -- the 1st April, 1938, and those who being in government Moti Ram Deka service on the 31st March 1938 did not hold a lien , etc. or a suspended lien on a permanent post on that v. date, shall ordinarily be required to retire at the age General of 55 years, but if he continues to be efhcient, should Manager, N.E.F. ordinarily be retained in service upto the age of 60 Railways. years but that he must not be retained after that age Maligaon except in very special circumstances, which must be Pandu; etc. recorded in writing, and with the sanction of the com- petent authority. Das Gupta J. These rules have been modified from time to time but generally speaking a rule has always existed fixing the age beyond which a railway servant will not be allowed to be retained in service. If such a rule of compulsory retirement had not existed, the servant would have had the right to continue in the service till his death. The rule however limits that right, by providing in effect that the service would be terminated at a certain age. Rule 148(3) is just another rule, limiting the servant's right to continue in service. lt is as much a condition of service as Rule 2046 and in deciding the nature and extent of the right of a railway servant to whom Rule 148(3) applies to continue in service, Rule 148l3J is of as much importance as Rule 2046. A railway servant to whom Rule 148(3) applies has two limita- tions put on his right to continue-(l) termination on attaining a certain age and (2) termination on service of a notice under Rule 148(3). Where the service is terminated by the order of retirement under Rule 2046, the termination is of a service where the servant has not the right to continue. So, it is not 'removal' or 'dismissal'. Equally clearly and for the same reason, when the service is terminated by notice under Rule 148(3), the termination is not 'removal' or 'dismissal'. It has not been suggested that the second test of loss of accrued benefits is satisfied . in terminations under Rule 148(3). If in any particular instance the order of termination entails loss of accrued benefits that will happen not because of anything in R. 148(3) ' - 5S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 769 but for some extraneous action. Where that hap- 1963 pens it will be right to consider such terminations as removal or dismissal. But that consideration Moti Ram Deka is foreign to the provisions of Rule 148(3). etc. v. I have therefore come to the conclusion that General the first ground raised by the appellants in challenging Manager, N.E.F the validity of Rule 148(3)., viz., that it contravenes Railways, the provisions of Art. 311 of the Constitution must Ma/igaon, be rejected. Pandu, etc. It is necessary now to consider the second ground Das Gupta J. urged by the appellants, viz., that Rule 148(3) contra- venes Art. 14 of the Constitution. Two contentions are urged in support of this ground. First, it is urged that the Rule gives no guidance to the authority who would take action on it as regards the principle to be tollowed in exercising the power. Secondly, it is urged that the Rule discriminates between railway servants and other public servants. In my opinion, there is considerable force in the first contention. Classifying the statutes which may come up for con- sideration on a question of its validity under Art. 14 of the Constitution in Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice S.R. Tendolkar & Ors. ''1 this Court observed under the third class of such statutes thus:- \"A statute may not make any classification of the persons or things for the purpose of apply- ing its provisions but may leave it to the discretion of the Government to select and classify persons or things to whom its provisions are to apply. In determining the question of the validity or otherwise of such a statute the Court will not strike down the law out of hand only because no classification appears on its face or because a discretion is given to the Government to make the selection or classification but will go on to examine and ascertain if the statute has laid down any principle or policy for the guidance of the exercise of discretion by the government in the matter of the selection or classification.\" ~ (1)- [1959] S.C.R. 279. 1/SCl/64-49 770 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 Applying the principle laid down in the above case -- to the present Rule I find on scrutiny of the Rule Moti Ram Deka that it does not lay down any principle or policy for etc. guiding the exercise of. discretion by the authority v. who will terminate the service in the matter of selec- General tion or classification. Arbitrary and uncontrolled Manager, N..E.F. power is left in the authority to select at its will any Railways, person against whom action will be taken. The Ma/igaon, Rule thus enables the authority concerned to discrimi- Pandu, etc. nate between two railway servants to both of whom Rule 148(3) equally applied by taking action in one Das Gupta J. case and not taking it in the other. In the absence of any guiding principle in the exercise of the discretion by the authority the Rule has therefore to be struck down as contravening the requirements of Art. 14 of the Constitution. It is unnecessary for me to consider the other contention as mentioned above, which has been urged in support of this ground. My conclusion therefore is that though the provisions of Rule 148(3) in respect of certain non- pensionable railway servants that their services shall be liable to termination on notice for the period prescribed therein does not contravene Art. 311(2) of the Constitution, it contravenes Art. 14 of the Constitution and consequently is void. I would accordingly allow with costs the four appeals (C.A. Nos. 711-713/62 and C.A. No. 714/62) set aside the order of the High Court and order that appropriate writs be issued in favour of the appellant as prayed for. The other three appeals (C.A. Nos. 837-839 of 1963) challenge the decision of the Assam High Court in favour of three railway servants whose services had been terminated under Rule 149 of the Railway Code, that these terminations were invalid.

SHAH J.-Except as expressly provided by the Constitution, every member of the defence services or of a civil service of the Union or an all-India service holds office during the pleasure of the President and every member of a civil service of a State holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the State: Art. 310(1). This is the normal tenure of office of persons serving the Union or the State. The doctrine of holding office at pleasure applies even to a person with special qualifications employed under a contract, with the reservation that compensation may be paid to such person if before the expiry of the agreed period the office is abolished, or for reasons not connected with misconduct on his part, he is required to vacate that post: Art. 310(2). The power to terminate at pleasure vested by the Constitution in the President or the Governor, as the case may be, is not liable to be restricted by any enactment of the Parliament or the State Legislature: it may be exercised only in the manner prescribed by the Constitution and being outside the scope of Arts. 53 and 154 of the Constitution cannot be delegated : State of Uttar Pradesh v.

The power of the President or the Governor under Art. 310 (which is wholly independent of the power conferred by the rules or legislation under Art. 309), and the power conferred by legislation enacted or rules made or continued by virtue of Art. 309 are subject to certain restrictions contained in Arts. 311 & 314. Article 314 grants certain special protections to mem hers appointed by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of State in Council to a civil service of the Crown in India and who continue on and after the commence- ment of the Constitution to serve under the Government of India or a State. Article 311 provides, subject to the proviso to cl. (2), two safeguards to all public servants who are members of the civil service of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a State who hold civil posts under the Union. or the States. These safeguards are- \"(!) that such members of the service shall not be .dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appoin- ted; and (2) that he shall not be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him.\" ~ . • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 773 The proviso to cl. (2) of Art. 311 excludes three 1963 specific classes of cases from the protection of the second guarantee.

Article 310 Pandu. etc. must therefore be read subject to Art. 311(2), and· the rules made or legislation enacted under Art. Shah J. 309 must also be read subject to Art. 311. It must be emphasized that the guarantees protect all servants, whether appointed to substantive posts, or employed temporarily or on probation, or for limited duration under contracts, but they do not encompass all penal- ties or terminations of employment. The guarantee under cl. (1) is against dismissal or removal by an authority subordinate to that by which the public ser- vant was appointed, and under cl. (2) against dismissal, removal or reduction in rank without being afforded a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him. The guarantee under cl. (2) does not affect the investment of power to dismiss, remove or reduce in rank a member of the civil service; it merely places restrictions upon the exercise of the power. Temporary servants, ser- vants on probation, officiating servants and even those holding posts under contracts-all have the protection of Art. 311. But the consequences of mere determi- nation of employment in the very nature of things must vary according to the conditions or terms of employment. Mere determination of employment of temporary servants, or probationers, and of servants whose tenure is governed by contracts, will not ordi- narily amount to dismissal or removal, for, dismissal or removal according to the rules implies determi- nation as a disciplinary measure. The appellants in appeals Nos. 711 to 714 of 1962 are public servants employed in the Railways under the management of the Government of India ,__.- 774 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 and were governed by the rules made under Art. 309, and their services were terminated in purported Moti Ram Deka exercise of powers under Rule 148(3).

The first clause Pandu, etc. deals with a temporary railway servant who holds Shah J. no lien on a permanent post under the Union. Such a person need be given no notice of termination of employment, if the termination is due to the expiry of sanction to the post, or of the officiating vacancy or is due to mental or physical incapacity, or where it amounts to removal or dismissal as a disciplinary measure. Clause (2) deals with apprentices. Clause (3) deals with· (non-pensionable) railway servants, who are substantively appointed to permanent posts. Clauses (3) & ( 4) provide: \"(3) Other (non-pensionable) railway servants- The service of other (non-pensionable) railway servants shall be liable to termination on notice on either side for the periods shown below. Such notice is not however required in cases of dismis- sal or removal as a disciplinary measure after compliance with the provisions of clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution, retirement on attaining the age of superannuation, and termina- tion of service due to mental or physical incapa- city:- · (a) Probationary officers and officers on pro- bation other than those in the Medical Department. ............. 3 months' notice (b) Officers on probation in the Medical Depart- ment .......... 1 month's notice (c) Permanent Officers ( d) Permanent employees Gazetted .......... 6 months' notice Non-gazetted .......... 1 month's notice. 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 775 \"( 4) In lieu of the notice prescribed in 1963 this rule, it shall be permissible on the part - of the Railway Administration to terminate the Moti Ram Deka service of a railway servant by paying him the etc. pay for the period of notice.\" v. . General In this group of appeals (Nos. 711-714 of 1962) M N EF the principal question raised by the appellants is an;g~(' · · , that the third clause of Rule 148 is invalid. The Ma~.ways, clause declares that the service of any railway servant R a ~gao~, who holds non-pensionable employment is liable to be an u, e c. terminated on notice on either side of the periods set Shah J. out in the Rule, but notice terminating employment by the Railway Administration is not a condition of dis- missal or removal or of retirement on attaining the age of superannuation and of termination of service due to mental or physical incapacity. The clause pre- scribes the mode of determination of employment of non-pensionable railway servants by notice and proceeds to state that in the specified cases no notice for termination of employment by the Railway Adminis- tration shall be necessary. It, however, does not follow that in the excepted classes of cases of the right of the Railway Administration to terminate employment is absolute or unrestricted: it is merely intended to be enacted by cl. ( 3) that notice will be necessary where on compliance with other appropriate conditions, there is retirement on attaining the age of superannuation, or determination of employment in compliance with the provisions of the Constitution, or for mental or physical incapacity. Clause (3) of Rule 148 is impugned by the appel- lants on two principal grounds: (1) that it is inconsistent with the protection which is guaranteed to all public servants by Art. 311 (2) ; and (2) that it contravenes the fundamental freedom under Art. 14 of the Constitution in that certain classes of railway servants are selected for special prejudicial treatment when no such conditions of service are applicable in any other public employment and that in 776 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964) 1963 any event an arbitrary power is conferred upon the authority competent in that behalf Moti Ram Deka under the rules to terminate employment etc. without any principle to guide him. Ge:~ral Under the first head it is urged that termination by Manager NE F notice of employment of non-pensionable servants Rail~ay; · ·under Rule 148(3) being 'removal from service, in the Ma/igaon' absence of rules prescribing machinery for affording Pandu et~ a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the _:._ · action proposed to be taken in regard to such employees, Shah J. the Rule infringes the constitutional guarantee under Art. 311 and is void. This plea assumes that every termination of employment by notice under Rule 148(3) amounts to removal. But on the plain text of cl. (3) it is evident that the right to determine employ- ment by notice cannot be exercised in the excepted cases and since dismissal or removal as a disciplinary measure falls within those excepted cases, the President has, by framing cl. (3) of Rule 148, clearly expressed the intention that determination of employment which amounts to dismissal or removal cannot be effected by notice. In terms the clause makes a distinction between determination of employment by notice and determination of employment as a disciplinary measure, retirement on superannuation, and termination for reasons of physical or mental incapacity: it does not confer authority upon the Railway Administration to terminate employment of a public servant holding a substantive post, as a disciplinary measure. The Rule is framed under Art. 309, and undoubted- ly makes the tenure of a public servant appointed even substantively to hold a permanent post precarious. Ordinarily a railway servant appointed substantively to a permanent post would, under the rules governing employment, continue in service till he attains the age of superannuation but that tenure is made subject to compulsory retirement after he attains the prescribed age if the railway servant belongs to certain specified classes: vide Rule 2046(2) & (3) of the Railway Code, 1958, and to discharge from employment under Rule 148(3) if his service is non-pensionable. Inci- • .. ..... ... • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 777 dents relating to termination of employment on 1963 superannuation, on orders of compulsory retirement, and on discharge from service under Rule 148(3) are Moti Ram Deka parts of an organic scheme of rules governing the etc. tenure of office of railway servants which also includes v. provisions relating to dismissal, removal or reduction ·General in rank as a disciplinary measure. By being appointed Manager, N.E.F. to a post a railway servant becomes entitled to the Railways. pay and allowances, increments subject to efficiency- Ma/igaon, bar, leave, gratuity, pension etc. These are also Pandu, etc. incidents of employment of the same character as the incident of determination of employment by Shah J. • compulsory retirement, discharge by notice and dismis- sal or removal. In considering what the expression \"dismissed or removed\" used in Art. 311 means, a brief review of the relevant legislative history dealing with the tenure of office of civil servants in the employment of the Government of India may be useful. It is sufficient to note that since the earliest time all persons holding office-civil or military-under the East India Com- pany were liable to be removed at the pleasure of the King of England: see s. 35 Charter Act 1793 (33 Geo. Ill Ch. 2): and 74 Charter Act 1833 (3 & 4 will IV Ch. 85). These provisions however did not take away the power of the Court of Directors to remove or dismiss any of its officers or servants not appointed by the Crown in England. The same tenure of service prevailed after the British Crown took over the governance of India, the power to make regulations in re!a:tion to appointments and admission to services and matters connected therewith being vested in the Secretary of State in Council: s. 37 Govern- ment of India Act 1858 (21 & 22 Viet. Ch. 106). For the first time under the Government of India Act, 1919 (9 & 10 Geo. V. Ch. 101) some protection was conferred upon the civil servants. By the first clause of s. 96-B the tenure of office of every employee under the civil service of the Crown was during pleasure of His ·Majesty, but dismissal from service by an authority subordinate to that by which the officer 778 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] 1963 was appointed was prohibited. The. power of the Secretary of State for India in Council to make rules Mori Ram Deka regulating classification of civil services, method of etc. recruitment, conditions of service, pay, allowances, v. discipline and conduct was reaffirmed. This was General followed by ss. 240 to 243 of the Government of India Manager, N.E.F.Act, 1935 (26 Geo. V. & 1 Ed. 8 Ch. 2) which made Railways, detailed provisions relating to the tenure of office of Maligaon, persons employed in civil capacities, recruitment and Pandu, ere. conditions of service and rules to be made in that behalf including rules applicable to railway, custom, Shah J. postal and telegraph services, and special provisions relating to the police. By s. 240, a guarantee against dismissal without being afforded an opportunity of showing cause to persons employed in civil capacities was provided. By cl. (1) except as provided by the Act, every member of a civil service held office during His Majesty's pleasure: by cl. (2) it was enacted that \"no such person shall be dismissed from service, by any authority subordinate to that . by which he was appointed\" and by cl. (3) it was enacted that \"No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action pro- posed to be taken in regard to him\". This was the guarantee of protection conferred by the Government of India Act 1935 upon members of the civil services and has since been affirmed by the Constitution in Art. 311 in almost the same terms-the slight verbal alteration substituting \"dismissed or removed\" for \"dismissed\" having made no variation in the content of the guarantee. In 1930 Rules were promulgated by the Secretary of State for India in Council under s. 96-B(2) of the Government of India Act, 1919, called the Classification, Control and Appeal Rules. These Rules did not in terms apply to railway servants, who were governed by a set of rules published as the Railway Establishment Code, but these were for all practical purposes in terms similar to the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, which may be called 'the General Rules'. Under cl. 49 of the General Rules penalties which could be imposed - •• > .. • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME SOURT REPORTS 779 upon civil servants were enumerated and cl. 55 1963 provided that no order of dismissal, removal or -- reduction shall be passed upon a civil servant Moti Ram Deka unless he has been informed in writing of the grounds ere. on which it is proposed to take action and he has v. been afforded adequate opportunity of showing cause General against the action proposed to be taken. These Ma,,ager, N.E.F. Rules remained in force after the Government of India Railways, Act, 1935, was brought into operation. Even after Maligaon, the Constitution was brought into force, the rules Pandu, etc continued to remain in operation till 1955, when a new set of rules were promulgated, but thereby Shah J. in Rules 49 & 55 no substantial variation was made. It is clear that under the scheme of rules governing the employment of civil servants which obtained prior to the Constitution dismissal or removal had acquired a definite connotation, and when the Con- stitution-makers adopted the scheme of protection of public servants in the same form in which it pre- vailed earlier, an intention to attribute to the expression \"dismissed and removed\" the same content may be assumed in the absence of any expressed intention to the contrary. Since the constitutional guarantee of protection to public servants is couched in the same terms, the expression \"removal\" in the Service Rules having the same meaning as \"dismissal\" i.e., deter- mination of employment as a disciplinary measure for misconduct, subject to the slight variation that an employee removed from service is not disqualified from future employment in public service, whereas a dismissed employee is so disqualified, it may reason- ably be held that in the context of this development under the Constitution the expression \"dismissed or removed\" has not acquired a wider signification to include all terminations of public employment, what- ever be the cause. Apart from the historical evolution of the guaran- tee, there is inherent indication in the constitutional provisions that it was not the intention of the Constitution-makers to include in the expression \"dismissed or removed\" all terminations of employ- 780 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [ 1964 J 1963 ment. Guarantee of reasonable opportunity of . -- showing cause against the action proposed to be }Jou Ram Deka taken in regard to a public servant, would be etc. wholly inappropriate in cases of superannuation, v. expiry of the contractual priod of employment, General expiry of the priod of probation or temporary Manager, N.E.F. employment, and resignations. · It would be futile in Railways, such cases to provide for \"showing cause\". The Maligaon, use of the expression \"action proposed to be taken Pandu, etc. in regard to him\" also suggests that termination of Shah J. employment is of the nature of penal action. There is yet another ground which must be taken into account. For nearly two centuries prior to the Constitution tenure of public servants has been expressly declared to be during the pleasure of the Bri- tish Crown and that tenure has been repeated in the Constitution in Art. 310(1) with appropriate variations entrusting the power to the President or the Governor, as the case may be. Vitality of this declaration is emphasized in cl. (2) of Art. 310 so as to enable the President or the Governor to terminate even contrac- tual employments at their respective pleasure. If the Constitution-makers intended that every termina- tion of employment amounted to dismissal or removal within Art. 311, the provision of Art. 310, solemnly declaring that members of the services civil and defence hold office during the pleasure of the President is reduced to a meaningless formula having no practical content. The argument that it continues to apply to probationers and temporary employees ignores the plain words of the Constitution, beside unduly mini- . mising the content of the guarantee in Art. 311 which protects all public servants--temporary, probationers, contractual as well as those holding substantive posts. There is also a consistent body of authority which has taken the view that the expression \"dismis- sed or removed\" within the meaning of Art. 311 of the Constitution involves determinaion of employ- ment as a disciplinary measure-that is termination of employment on some ground personal to · the officer concerned, such as incapacity or imputation • - .. • 5 S.C.R.

Union of IndiaW;Motl Ram Deka Shyam Lal v. State of Uttar Pradesh & The Union of etc. Indid 2>; and Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of v. India (3J. General Manager, N.E.F. In considering whether termination of employ- Railv»ays, ment of a public servant amounts to dismissal or Maligaon, removal, the primary test settled by a uniform course Pandu, etc. of authority is: does the termination amount to punishment of the public servant, i.e., has it the effect ShahJ. of depriving the public servant concerned of the rights which he has already acquired as a public servant, or does it involve evil consequences such as forfeiture of pay or allowances or other benefits which by the rules governing the tenure he has earned, or impute a stigma? A public servant appointed substan- tively to a post normally acquires a right to hold the post until he attains the age of superannuation, and in the absence of a contract or service rules governing the tenure, discharge from service would deprive him of the right he has to the post. Such deprivation of rights already accrued, or involving evil consequences, must in all cases amount to dismissal or removal, for, it amounts to imposing punishment. But mere termination of the right to hold a post not as a discip- linary measure, but according to the contract or rules governing his appointment and tenure, cannot be so regarded, because the rules which govern his right to the post make determination in the manner provided inherent in the right. By appointment to an office a public servant does not acquire a right to hold it for his natural life time or even during good behaviour. His right to hold it is during the pleasure of the Pre- sident or the Governor, according as his employment is under the Union or the State: the right is also sub- ject to the contract or rules governing the employ- ment.

The title of a railway servant holding a non- Pandu, etc. pensionable office is subject to the condition of de- Shah J. termination by notice under Rule 148(3) which as the clause expressly provides is not according to its terms exercisable as a disciplinary measure. It cannot be assumed that on acquisition of the office, a railway servant becomes entitled to a right to the post free from the conditions attaching thereto by the rules governing his employment. He is liable to vacate the office on superannuation, on compulsory retire- ment, on notice of determination, and on dismissal or removal alike, i.e., on the supervention of the prescribed conditions determination of employment of the prescribed class results, and not otherwise. Terminations resulting from causes other than dis- missal or removal are solely governed by the rules, but in the matter of dismissal or removal, beside the conditions prescribed by the appropriate rules, the overriding provisions of the Constitution must be complied with. Under the Indian Railway Establishment Code, Vol. II, \"lien\" is defined in Rule 2003(14) as meaning the title of a railway servant to hold substantively, either immediately or on the termination of a priod or periods of absence, a permanent post, including a tenure post, to which he has been appointed substantively. Evidently lien is the title which the railway servant has to a post, and a public servant appointed sub- stantively must always till he is superannuated have lien on a specific post. On substantive promotion his lien would attach to another post, his earlier lien being superseded. While a railway servant appoin- .- < • ... -. 5 S.C.R . SUPREME COURT REPORTS 783 ted to another post substantively must have a lien to 1963 that post, it cannot be assumed that his lien continues . -- to attach to any particular post. The lien is however Mot• Ram Deka subject to the rules: it does not in any manner confer etc. a right to hold a post indefinitely. v. General Counsel for the appellants contended that all Manager, N.E.F. the appellants in this group of appeals were permanent Railways employees, and even superannuation did not put Maligaon: an end to employment, since under the rules the super- Pandu, etc . . annuated employees had a right to pension. It is impossible to hold that a superannuated employee Shah J. continues to remain employed. His employment is at an end: he is under no obligation to serve and earns no remuneration. The pension is but a payment made by the State for services already rendered and not in lieu of services being rendered, or which the public servant may be called upon to render. There can therefore be no distinction in principle between termination of employment of the employee attaining the prescribed age of superannuation, and termination of services in the manner prescribed by the rules, by notice, or by an order of compulsory retirement. In all cases employment comes to an end. Though the causes which result in termination are different, the effect is the same, viz., the public servant ceases to be employed. The argument that on being appointed to a public service, the employee acquires right to continue in employment, proceeds upon a misconception of the nature of appointment to a public post. Appoint- ment to a public post is always subject to the pleasure of the President, the exercise of such pleasure being · restricted in the manner provided by the Constitution. A person appointed substantively to a post does not acquire a right to hold the post till he dies, he acquires thereby merely a right to hold the post subject to the rules i.e., so long as under the rules the employment is not terminated. If the employment is validly termina- ted, the right to hold the post is determined even apart from the exercise of the pleasure of the President or the Governor. There is in truth no permanent 784 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [ 1964] 1963 appointment of a public servant under the Union . - or the State. Nor is the appointment to a public Moti Ram Dekapost during good behaviour, i.e., a public servant etc. cannot claim to continue in office so long as he is . v. . of a good behaviour. · Such a concept of the tenure . General of a public servant's office is inconsistent with Arts. Manager, N.E.F. 309 and 310 of the Constitution . . Railways, Maligaon It may be recalled that the guarantee under Art.

But if the determination of service does not amount to dismissal or removal as a disciplinary measure, there is nothing in the Constitution which prohibits such determination provided it is consistent with Art. 309 of the Constitution. The tenure of office is subject to Art. 310, prescribed by Art. 309 that is the governing code. The rules cannot undoubtedly provide for dismissal or removal other- wise than in a manner consistent with Art. 311. Nor can an authority acting under the rules validly terminate an appointment to a post in a manner contrary to the Constitution or the rules. Article 311 however covers only a part of the field governing the tenure of employment and in substance provides for a procedure for exercising the right to determine employment in certain specified classes of cases. To hold that this determination of employment must in all cases, whatever may be the source or the power in the exercise of which it is determined, is to attribute to it a more exalted effect than is warran- ted by the scheme of the Constitution disclosed by Arts. 309 and 310. The view which I have expressed is consistent with an overwhelming body of uniform authority dealing with different classes of cases in this Court, and we are asked to ignore the principle derived from that body of authority not on the ground of any demonstrable error but on the sole ground of a possible misuse of the powers entrusted to the Railway Adminis- tration and that was, as I understood, practically the only argument advanced at the Bar to justify a • - <. ., 5 S.C.R.

Likewise General an appointment to a temporary post in a Govern- Manager, N.E F. ment service may be substantive or on probation Railways, or on an officiating basis. Here also, in the Maligaon, absence of any special stipulation or any specific Pandu, etc. service rule, the servant so appointed acquires no right to the post and his service can be termi- Shah J. nated at any time except in one case, namely, when the appointment to a temporary post is for a definite period.\" In The State of Bihar v. Gopi Kishore PrasadOl Sinha C.J., speaking for the Court summarised certain propositions governing the tenure of temporary pub- lic servants of which the following two are material: \"(l) Appointment to a post on probation gives to the person so appointed no right to the post and his service may be terminated, without taking recourse to the proceedings laid down in the relevant rules for. dismissing a public servant, or removing him from service. (2) The termination of employment of a person holding a post on probation without any enquiry whatsoever cannot be said to deprive him of any right to a post and is, therefore, no punish- ment.\" In The State of Orissa and another v. Ram Narayan Das C2l this Court held that a probationer may be discharged in the manner provided by Rule 55-B of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, and to such discharge from service Art. 311 (2) did not apply, for mere termination of employment does not carry with it any evil consequences and an order discharging a public servant, even if he is a (I) [1961] 2 S.

The same view was expressed in Union Territory, Tripura v. Gopal Chandra Dattal 2) and in Ranendra • Chandra Bannerjee v. The Union of India(3). Two cases on the other side of the line, which emphasize the distinction between a mere order of discharge of a temporary servant, and an order dis- missing a public servant as a disciplinary measure may be noticed. In Madan Gopal v. The State of · Punjab and others (4), this Court pointed out that where the employment of a temporary government servant, even though liable to be terminated by notice of one month without assigning any reason, is not so terminated, and the appointing authority holds an enquiry into his alleged misconduct, the termi- nation of service is by way of punishment, because it casts a stigma on his competence and thus affects his career. In such a case the public servant 1s entitled to the protection of Art. 311(2) of the Con- stitution. In Jagdish Mitter v. The Union of India (5) it was held that an order discharging a temporary servant from employment by notice after recording that he was \"found undesirable to be retained in Government service\" was one casting a stigma, and (1) [1963] 1 S.C.R. 416.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 789 was therefore an order of dismissal attracting the 1963 application of Art. 311 (2) of the Constitution. . - There is still another class of cases which illustrate Moti Ram Deka the rule that termination of employment otherwise etc. as a disciplinary measure does not amount to dis- v. missal or removal. This Court has held that rules General providing for compulsorily retiring public servants Manager, N.E.F. holding posts substantively are valid, and that termi- Railways, nation of employment consequent upon such compul- Ma/igaon, sory retirement does not amount to dismissal or removal Pandu, etc. from service so as to attract the protection of Art. 311(2). Shah J. In Shyam Lal's case(IJ challenge to the validity of termination of employment of a member of the Indian Service of Engineers compulsorily retired after he completed service for 25 years was discountenanced by this Court on the ground that compulsory retirement under the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, after a public servant had served for 25 years, did not amount to dismissal or removal within the meaning of Art. 311 of the Constitution. It was observed that the word \"removal\" used synony- mously with the term \"dismissal\" generally implied that the officer was regarded as in some manner blame- worthy or deficient, the action of removal being founded on some ground personal to the officer ·in- volving levelling of some imputation or charge against him. But there was no such element of charge or imputation in the case of compulsory retirement which did not involve any stigma or implication of misbehaviour or incapacity, for, by the compulsory retirement the person concerned did not lose any benefit he had earned and loss of future prospects of earning could not be taken into account in consider- ing whether the order of compulsory retirement amounted to imposing punishment. In The State of Bombay v. Subhagchand M. Doshi( 2 ) it was held that Rule 165-A of the Bombay Civil Services (Conduct, Discipline and Appeal) Rules adopted by the State of Saurashtra, subject to amend- ment, authorising the State Government to compulsorily (If1T955] I S.C.R. 26.

General Venkatarama Aiyar, J., observed at p. 579 (obiter Manager, N.E.F. as was pointed out in a later case): . Railways . M f'g ' \"It should be added that quest10ns of the P 0 Ju 0~~~ above character could arise only when the rules an ' • fix both an age of superannuation and an age Shah .1. for compulsory retirement and the services of a civil servant are terminated between these two points of time. But where there is no rule fixing the age of compulsory retirement, or if there is one and the servant is retired before the age prescribed therein, then that can be re- regarded only as dismissal or removal within Art. 311(2).\" In P. Balakottaiah v. The Union of India and othersOJ an order for compulsory retirement under Rule 3 of the Railway Services (Safeguarding of Nation- al Security) Rules, 1949, was challenged as contravening Art. 311 (2). The public servants concerned in those appeals were railway servants and their services were ter.minated on the ground that the General Manager of the Railways had reason to believe that they were guilty of \"subversive activities\". Notices were issued to them under s. 3 of the Rules to show cause against certain charges. The Committee of Advisers en- . quired into the charges and the explanations furnished by the public servants found the charges true. The General Manager acting on the report of the Commit- tee terminated the services of the railway servants concerned giving them .a month's salary in lieu of notice. It was held by this Court that it is not every termination of the services of an employee that falls within the operation of Art. 311, and that it is only when the order is by way of punishment that it is one of dismissal or removal under that Article. It was further observed at p. 1065: (I) [1958] S.C.R. 1052. ,I( { 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 791 \"In the present case, the terms of employ- 1963 ment provide for the services being terminated -- on a proper notice, and so, no question of prema- Moti Ram Deka ture termination arises. Rule 7 of the Security etc. Rules preserves the rights of the employees v. to all the benefits of pension, gratuities and the General like, to which they would be entitled under the Manager, N.E.F. rules. Thus, there is no forfeiture of benefits Railways, already acquired. . . . The order Ma/igaon, terminating the services under R. 3 of the Security Pandu, etc. Rules stands on the same footing as an order of discharge under R. 148, and it is neither one of dismissal nor of removal within the meaning of Art. 311.\" The Court in that case appeared to express the opin- ion, though it was not necessary for deciding the case, that an order of discharge under Rule 148(3) was neither one of dismissal nor removal within the meaning of Art. 311(2). In Parshotam Lal Dhingra's case 0) the Court also considered the question whether an order of compulsory retirement of a public servant under the appropriate rules governing him amounts to dis- missal or removal from service. At p. 861, Das C.J., · speaking for the majority of the Court observed: \" . . every termination of service is not a dismissal, removal or reduction in rank. A termination of service brought about by the exercise of a contractual right is not per se dis- missal or removal, . . . . . Likewise the termination of service by compul- sory retirement in terms of a specific rule regulating the conditions of service is not tantamount to the infliction of a punishment and does not attract Art. 311(2), as has also been held by this Court in Shyam Lal v. The State of Uttar Pradesh. In either of the two above-mentioned cases the termination of the service did not carry with it the penal consequences of loss of pay, or all0w- ances under r. 52 of the Fundament!ll Rules.\" (!) [1958] S.C.R. 828. Shah J. ' • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 793 conditions which were offered to him and which he 1963 accepted, are not binding upon him. The sole ex- . - ception to that rule is in cases where the condition Motz Ram Deka prescribed by contract or statutory regulations is etc. void as inconsistent with the constitutional safeguard, G v. / the exception being founded not on any right in the U enera public servant to elect, but on the invalidity of the anager' NE F. 1 · l f · d' Railways, covenant or regu at10n. If the princip e o the bm mg Maligaon, nature of the rules as condition of employment is Pandu, etc. valid, I am unable to see any distinction between cases of termination of employment resulting from attain- Shah J. ing the age of superannuation or from orders of com- pµlsory retirement, terminating contracts, terminating temporary employment, or employments on probation, and orders terminating employment after notice under Rule 148(3). If Rule 165-A of the Bombay Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, as amended, which fell to be considered in Saubhag- Chand Doshi' s case <1l was not invalid, if Rule 3 of the Railway Services (Safeguarding of National Security) Rules, 1949, which fell to be considered in P. Balakottaiah' s case<21 was not invalid, if Rule 278 of the Patiala State Regulations which fell to be considered in Dalip Singh' s case 0) was not invalid, if Rule S(a) of the Central Government Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1949, which fell to be considered in Satish Chandra Anand' s case (4J was also not invalid, it is difficult to appreciate any ground either of logic or of law on which the vice of invalidity as infringing Art. 311(2) may be attributed to Rule 148(3 ). The termination of em- ployment under Rule 148(3) does not involve the public servant concerned in loss of any right which he has already acquired, .it does not amount to loss of a post to which he is entitled under the terms of his employment, because the right to the post is necessarily circumscribed by the conditions of employment which include Rule 148(3) and does not cast any stigma upon him. In the result I am unable to agree that (1) [1958] S.C.R. 571. (2) [1958] S.C.R. 1052. (3) [1961] S.C.R. 88.

Moti Ram Deka . 1 In appeals Nos. 837-839 of 1963 the quest10n as e c. to the validity of the Rule 149(3) falls to be determined. G v. / That Rule was substituted for the original Rule 148(3) M ener~ E F some time in year 1959. Rule 149 deals, by its first anager, · · ·clause, with temporary railway servants and cl. (2) Railways, · deals with apprentices. We are not concerned in Ma/igaon, these appeals either with temporary railway servants Pandu, etc. or with apprentices. In this Rule cl. (3) deals with Shah J. the other railway servants. It provides: \"The service of other railway servants shall be liable to termination on notice on either side for the periods shown below. Such notice is not, however, required in cases of dismissal or removal as a disciplinary measure after com- pliance with the provisions of clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution, retirement on attaining the age of superannuation, and termination of servke due to mental or physical incaoacity.\" The Rule then proceeds to set out the different periods for which notice may be given terminating employ- ment. Clause (4) of the Rule provides for payment in lieu of notice. Rule 149(3) makes a departure from Rule 148(3). The latter Rule applied only to members of the non-pensionable service, whereas Rule 149(3) applies to all members of the railway service holding substantive appointments, and brings within its fold all employees--even those who have entered employ- ment before the date on which the Rule was framed. But if by the terms of his appointment a railway servant who was not governed by Rule 148(3) is brought within Rule 149(3) so as to make his employ- ment precarious by exposing him to liability to termi- nation of employment, different considerations may apply. For reasons which I have already set out the conditions of service validly made under Art. 309 of the Constitution and in existence on the date when a public servant enters service would be binding upon him. There is nothing in Rule 149(3) which renders determination of employment in the I' \\ .. ' • • 5 S.C.R. SlJPREME COURT REPORTS 795 manner provided therein per se inconsistent with 1963 Art. 311. But exercise of the power by the Railway Administration to determine employment of persons Moti Ram Deka who were otherwise not subject to the new condition etc. of service would, in my judgment, amount to impos- v. ing a penalty of dismissal or removal. Therefore . General termination of services of a person who held appoint- Manager, N.E F. ment to a substantive post and was entitled under Railways, the previous rules to continue until he attained the Maligaon, age of superannuation, or till compulsory retirement, Pandu, etc. Rule 149(3) made applicable to him after he entered service would per se amount to dismissal or removal Shah J. and it would be inconsistent with Art. 311. This is not because the Rule is invalid, but because it would expose the public servant concerned to for- feiture, by amendment of the rules which were in existence at the time when he entered service, of rights which he had already acquired. The alternative ground of invalidity that the rule infringes the fundamental right of equal protection of the laws under Art. 14 of the Constitution may now be considered. This ground was set up under two broad heads. (1) There is no other public employment under the Government of India in which conditions similar to these contained in Rule 148(3) or Rule 149(3) exist, and therefore discrimination between public servants employed in Railways and public servants employed in other branches of public undertakings or Administrative Services without any rational basis to support it, infringing the equal protection of laws guaranteed by Art.14 of the Constitution, results. The argument posed in this form does not appear to have been raised before the High Court and no investigation has been made whether similar condi- tions of service do or do not exist in other public employments. In any event, employment in the Rail- ways is in a vitally important establishment of the Union in which the employees are entrusted with 796 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964 J 1963 valuable equipment and a large measure of confidence . -- has to be reposed in them and on the due discharge Moti Ram Deka of the duties the safety of the public and the effi- etc. cient functioning of the governmental duties depend. v. Not only the travelling public, but the Union and the General . States have in a considerable measure to depend upon Manag~r, N.E.F. rail transport for the functioning of the governmental Railways, machinery and its welfare activities. It would be pos- Maligaon, sible even for one or a few employees of the Railway ~~~ I . . f to para yse commumcat10ns and movement o ess- Shah J. ential supplies leading to disorder and confusion. The Railway service has therefore a special respon- sibility in the smooth functioning of our body politic and a doctrinnaire approach to equality of conditions of service in different branches of public employment, irrespective of the nature of the duties performed, irrespective of the possibility of harm to the community which misguided members or units may be capable of doing, and irrespective of the necessity to entrust special powers to terminate employment in deserving cases may not be permitted. If for the purpose of ensuring the interests and safety of the public and the State, the President has reserved to the Railway Administration power to terminate employment under the Railways, it cannot be assumed that such vesting of authority singles out the railway servants for a special or discriminatory treatment so as to expose the Rule which authorises termination of employ- ment to the liability to be struck off as infringing Art. I 4. Article 14 undeniably forbids class legis- lation, but it does not forbid reasonable classifi- cation for the purpose of legislation. Legislation satisfying the test of classification founded on an intelligible differentia distinguishing persons, objects or things grouped together from others left out of the group, such differentia having a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute, has consistently been regarded as not open to challenge on the ground of infringing the equality clause of the constitution. The special conditions in which the Railways have to operate and the interests ;' ' - 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 797 of the nation which they serve justify the classifi- 1963 cation, assuming the argument of classification to -- be factually correct. It need hardly be pointed out Moti Ram Deka that the basis of classification need not be expressly etc. mentioned by the impugned statute: it may be gathered v. from the surrounding circumstances known to or General brought to the notice of the Court. Manager, N.E.F. d Railways (2) Rules 148(3) and Rule 149(3) are so frame M r ' as to lead to discriminatory freatment of P adigaon, R .1 b b h . f an u etc. at way servants, ecause y t e exercise o ' the arbitrary and uncontrolled power thereby Shah J. conferred, exercise of which is not to be tested by any objective standard, service of any public servant falling within the classes to which they apply may be terminated. Conferment of such a power leads to denial of the equal protection of the laws. Rule 148(3) as it stood applied only to non-pension- able services and not to pensionable services, and Rule 149(3) applies to all railway servants holding posts pensionable and non-pensionable. In dealing with a similar argument in Satish Chandra Anand' s case(!) in the context of termination of employ- ment of a servant employed on a contract for the duration of an Organisation but whose tenure was governed by the Central· Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1949, Bose, J., observed at p. 659: \"There was no compulsion on the petitioner to enter into the contract he did. He was as free under the law as any other person to accept or to reject the offer which was made to him. Having accepted, he still has open to him all the rights and remedies available to other persons similarly situated to enforce any rights under his contract which have been denied to him, assuming there are any, and to pursue in the ordinary courts of the land such remedies for a breach as are open to him to exactly the same extent as other persons similarly situated. He has not been discriminated against and he has not been denied the protection (I) [1953] S.C.R. 655. 798 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964 J 1963 of any laws which others similarly situated could claim.\" Moti Ram Deka etc. These observations in my judgment would, with ap- v. propriate variations, be applicable in considering General the validity of Rules 148(3) & 149(3). In adjudging I Manager NE F whether there is by the impugned rules a denial Raili:•ay;, · ·of the equal protection of the laws, no rational Maligaon, ground of distinction can be found between an em- Pandu, etc. ployee who is but for the rule for termination of em- I ployment by notice, by the contract entitled to continue Shah J. in employment for a specified duration, and one who ,· is appointed to a substantive post till superannuation. In one case the employment is for a period defined or definable, in the other there is employment till superannuation, and in both cases liable to be termi- ~ nated by notice. If with his eyes oren, a candidate for ., • employment accepts a post permanent or temporary, tenure of which is governed by Rules, he cannot after accepting the post seek to avoid the onerous terms of employment. This is not to say that acceptance of covenants or rules which are inconsistent with the Constitution is binding upon the public servant by virtue of his employment. Such covenants or rules which in law be regarded as void, would not affect the tenure of his office. The law which applies to railway servants falling within the class to which Rules 148(3) and 149(3) apply is the same. There are no different laws appli- cable to members of the same class. The applica- bility of the law is also not governed by different considerations. It is open to the appointing authority to terminate appointment of any person who falls within the class. There is therefore neither denial of equality before the law, nor denial of equal protec- tion of the laws. All persons in non-pensionable services were subject to Rule 148(3). There was no discrimination between them: the same law which protected other servants in the same group-non- pensionable servants-protected the appellants in ap- peals Nos. 711-714 of 1962, and also provided for determination of their employment. • • l • 5 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 799 The Rule, it is true, does not expressly provide 1963 for guidance to the authority exercising the power -- conferred by Rule 148, but on that account the Rule Moti Ram Deka cannot be said to confer an arbitrary power and be ere. unreasonable, or be in its operation unequal. The v. power is exercisable by the appointing authority General who normally is, if not the General Manager, a senior Manager, N.E.F. officer of the Railways. In considering the. validity Raihrays, of an order of determination of employment under Maligaon, Rule 148, an assumption that the power may be exer- Pandu, etc. cised mala fide and on that ground discrimination may be practised is wholly out of place. Because of Shah J. the absence of specific directions in Rule 148 governing the exercise of authority conferred thereby, the power to terminate employment cannot be regarded as an arbitrary power exercisable at the sweet will of the authority, when having regard to the nature of the employment and the service to be rendered, the im- portance of the efficient functioning of the rail transport in the scheme of our public economy, and the status of the authority invested with the exercise of the power, it may reasonably be assumed that the exercise of the power would appropriately be exercised for the protection of public interest on grounds of administrative convenience. Power to exercise discretion is not necessarily to be assumed to be a power to discriminate unlawfully, and possibility of abuse of power will not invalidate the conferment of power. Conferment of power has necessarily to be coupled with the duty to exercise it bona fide and for effectuating the purpose and policy under- lying the rules which provide for the exercise of the power. If in the scheme of the rules, a clear policy relating to the circumstances in which the power is to be exercised is discernible, the conferment of power must be regarded as made in furtherance of the scheme, and is not open to attack as infringing the equality clause. It may be remembered that the rules relating to termination of employment of temporary servants and those on probation, and even those relating to compulsory retirement generally do not lay down any specific directions governing the exercise of the powers 800 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1964] 1963 conferred thereby. The reason is obvious: the ap- -- pointing authority must in all these cases be left Moti Ram Deka with discretion to determine employment having re- etc. gard to the exigencies of the service, suitability of the v. employee for absorption or continuance in the cadre, General . and the larger interests of the public being served by Manager, N.E.F. retaining the public servant concerned in service. In Railways, my view Rule 148(3) cannot, therefore, be regarded Maligaon, as invalid either as infringing Art. 311(2) of the Pandu, etc.. Constitution or as infringing Art. 14 of the Consti- Shah J. tution. For the same reasons Rule 149(3) cannot also be regarded as invalid. f• f - But the orders imposing upon the public servants determination of employment in exercise of the powers under Rule 149(3) made applicable to them when prior to the date on which the Rule was framed they were not applicable to them, would be void as infring- ing Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. As, however, on this part of the case there has been no investigation by the High Court, I would remand appeals Nos. 837-839 of 1963 to the High Court and dismiss appeals Nos. 711-714 of 1962. ,. i: ;· ORDER BY COURT In accordance with the opinion of the majority , Civil Appeals Nos. 711-713 of 1962 and Civil Appeal No. 714 of 1962 are allowed with costs.
