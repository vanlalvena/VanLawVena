XXVII, r. 8A of CPC – Relying on the order of the unconditional stay, the Executing Court dismissed the execution petition – On appeal, held: The Arbitration Act is a special Actovides for quick resolution of disputes between the parties and s.18 of the Act makes it clear that the parties shall be treated with equality – Once the Act mandates so, there cannot be any special treatment given to the Government as a party – As such, under the scheme of the Arbitration Act, no distinction is made nor anyential treatment is to be given to the Government, while considering an application for grant of stay of a money decree in proceedings u/s. 34 of the Arbitration Act – The reference to CPC [2019] 9 S.C.R. 252 252 A B D E F G H 253 in s.36 of the Arbitration Act is only to guide the Court as to whatovisions of the Arbitration Act – Insofar Or.

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 – Or.XXVII, r.8A – Application of – Held: The archaic r. 8A of Order XXVII, CPC has no application or reference in the present times, even if it is assumed that the provisions of Or.XXVII, r.8A of CPC are to be applied, the same would only exempt the Government from furnishing security, whereas u/Or. XLI, r. 5 of CPC, the Court has the power to direct for full or part deposit and/or to furnish security of the decretal amount – r.8A only provides exemption from furnishing security, which would not restrict the Court from directing deposit of the awarded amount and part thereof. Allowing the appeals, the Court Arbitration Act mandates that while considering an application for stay filedAct, if stay is to be granted then it shall be subject to such conditions as may be deemed fit. The said sub-section clearly“subject to such conditions as it may deem fit”. The proviso makes it clear that the Court has to “have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure”. The phrase “have due regard to” would only mean that the provisions of CPC are to be taken into consideration, and not that they arey. While considering the phrase “having regard to”, this Court in the case of Shri Sitaram Sugar Company Limited. v. PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL A B D E F G H 254 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 9 S.C.R. Union of India (1990) 3 SCC 223 has held that “the words ‘having regard to’ in sub-section are the legislative instruction for the general. They are not strictly mandatory, but in essence directory.”. [Para 17] [266-H; 267-A-C] 2. In view of this Court, in the present context, the phrase used is ‘having regard to’ the provisions of CPC and not ‘in accordance with” the provisions of CPC. In the latter case, it would have been mandatory, but in the form as mentioned in Rule 36(3) of the Arbitration Act, it would only be directory or as a guiding factor. Mere reference to CPC in the said Section 36 cannot be construed in such a manner that it takes away the powered in the main statute (i.e. Arbitration Act) itself. It is to be taken as a general guideline, which will not make the mainovision of the Arbitration Act inapplicable. The provisions of CPC are to be followed as a guidance, whereas the provisions ofArbitration Act are essentially to be first applied. Since, the Arbitration Act is a self-contained Act, the provisions of the CPC will apply only insofar as the same are not inconsistent with theovisions of the Arbitration Act. [Para 18] [267-D-F] 3. Arbitration proceedings are essentially alternate dispute redressal system meant for early/quick resolution of disputes andee - award as passed by the Arbitrator against the Government is allowed to be automatically stayed, the veryArbitration Act. The Arbitration Act is a special Act which provides for quick resolution of disputes between the partiesAct makes it clear that the parties shall be treated with equality. Once the Act mandates so, there cannot be any special treatment given to the Government as a party. As such, under the scheme of the Arbitration Act, no distinction is made nor any differential treatment is to be given to theee in proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The reference to CPC in Section 36 of the Arbitration Act is only to guide the Court as to what conditions can be imposed, A B D E F G H 255 and the same have to be consistent with the provisions of theAct. [Para 24] [270-G-H; 271-A-C] 4. It may be true that the CPC provides for a differential treatment to the Government in certain cases, but the same may the Arbitration Act. For instance, Section 80 of CPC provides for a notice of two months to be given beforether, it is also provides that no ex-parte injunction order can be passed againstAct no such special provision has been made with regard to arbitration by or against the Government. There is noequirement under the Arbitration Act for a notice of two months to be given to the Government before invoking arbitrationoceeding against the Government. Further, Sections 9 and 17 of the Arbitration Act also provide for grant of ex-parte interim orders against the Government. [Para 25] [271-C-E] 5. Section 36 of the Arbitration Act also does not provide for any special treatment to the Government while dealing withArbitration Act. Keeping the aforesaid in consideration and also the provisions of Section 18 providing for equal treatment ofoceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. [Para 26] [271-F-G] 6. Although this Court is of the firm view that the archaic Rule 8A of Order XXVII CPC has no application or reference in, whereas under Order XLI Rule 5 of CPC, the Court has the power to direct for full or part deposit and/or toom furnishing security, which would not restrict the Court from directing deposit of the awarded amount and part PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by1. Leave granted. 2. In response to a notice inviting tender issued by the respondent relating to the work of “Special Repair Programme 2000-2001 for different stretches of National High Way-II from 622 Kmp to 625 Kmp, 627 Kmp to 628 Kmp and 630 Kmp to 631 Kmp (vide Job.B./70/2000) under the Hooghly High Way Division No.II in the District of Hooghly (Package No. II)”, the appellant,alongwith A B D E F G H 257 others, had applied. The bid of the appellantwas accepted on 26th March 2001, for which an agreement was registered on 2nd April, 2001. After several extensions were granted by the respondent for the delay which, th May 2003, the appellant raised its claims and dues before the Executive Engineer of Public Works (Roads) Department, Government of West Bengal. The claims of the appellant having not been paid, an application under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short ‘the Arbitration Act’) was filed by the appellant. By an order dated 14th August 2003, the Calcutta High Court was pleased to appoint Retired Justice Sujit Kumar Sinha as the Arbitrator to decide the disputes. By his award dated 21st January, 2010, the Arbitrator allowed some claims of the appellant and held the appellant to1,553/- plus interest at the rate of 18% per annum on a sum of Rs.1,34,06,965/- from the date of the award tillArbitrator, the respondent State of West Bengal filed an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the Calcutta High Court. The appellant filed its affidavit in opposition of the aforesaid, to which reply had also 3. Section 36 of the Arbitration Act has been amended by Act number 3 of 2016 with retrospective effect from 23.10.2015.In view ofArbitration Act, the respondent had not filed injunction application in the proceedings underArbitration Act. However, in view of the pronouncement of the judgment by this Court in the case of Board of Control for Cricket in India vs Kochi Cricket Private Limited(2018) 6 SCC 287, wherein it was held that the amended provisions of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act would also apply to the pending proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, the appellant filed an execution application before the Calcutta High Court (registered as E. C. No.297 4. In the executing proceedings, on 18.09.2018, the Executing Court adjourned the matter after recording that “in the event the operation of the award is not stayed by the adjourned date, the PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 258 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 9 S.C.R. petitioner shall be entitled to pray for attachment of the said amountd”. In the meantime, the respondent filed stay application under the amended Section 36(2) of the Arbitration Act in the pending proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the Calcutta High Court. On 27.09.2018, the stay application of, on 03.10.2018, which was the adjourned date fixed by the Executing Court in E.C.tate ofWest Bengal with the Reserve Bank of India. It was further clarified that in 5. Without filing the application for recall of the order dated 27.09.2018, whereby the stay application of the respondent had been,the present Appeal has been filed. 6. The submission of Shri Saurav Agarwal, learned counsel for the appellant is two-fold. Firstly, thatthe provision of Order XXVII Rule 8A CPC would not be applicable to the present case, and as such theArbitration Act. Secondly, it has been submitted that even if the provision of Order XXVII Rule 8A 7. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that as per the amended Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, filing of an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act shall not by itself render the award unenforceable unless the stay of the operation of the A B D E F G H 259 award is granted by the Court in accordance of the provisions of sub-“the court maysubject to such conditions as it may deem fit, grant stay of the operation of such award for reasons to be recorded in writing.” According to the learned counsel for the appellant, the proviso to the saidSection merely provides that the“having due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of money decree under the provisions of CPC”. It is thus been submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that under sub-Section (3) of Section 36, the CPC would“subject to” the provisions of sub-Section (2) of Section 36. According to the learned counsel, the phrase “subject to” the conditions, would mean that it is obligatory for the Court to impose such”have due regard” to the provisions of CPC, which would mean that the Court will take the said provisions of the CPC into consideration. Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the Arbitration Act is a complete code in itself and the stay application has to be considered asArbitration Act, having due regard to the provisions of CPC, which would not be same as “in accordance with” the provisions of CPC.It is vehemently urged that the provisions of Order XXVII Rule 8A CPC, which is an exception in the CPC, shouldArbitration Act as it would then result in limiting the effect of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act itself. According to the learned counsel, the provisions of Order XLI Rule 5 CPC alone have toArbitration Act. 8. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the Arbitration Act does not provide for any special treatment to the Government whileArbitration Act. According to the learned counsel, under CPC the Government is treatedferently, which is not the case in the Arbitration Act. As an illustration, it has been stated that two months noticeunder Section 80 CPC is provided PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 260 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 9 S.C.R. for before any suit is filed against the Government, which is not so in theArbitration Act expressly provides for equal treatment of all parties involved, which would include the Government as a party. 9. In the alternative, learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that even if the provisions of Order XXVII Rule 8A are to be taken into,which would not mean that the Courts are mandated to pass an unconditional stay of the award.In support of his submissions, th report of the Law Commission, which shall be considered at the time of dealing with the arguments. 10. Per contra, Shri Anand Grover, learnedSenior Counsel appearing for the respondent State of West Bengal has contended that the proceedings contemplated under the Arbitration Act are two-fold. Chapters V and VI deal with the conduct of arbitral proceedings, whereasVII, VIII and IX of the Arbitration Act deal with proceedings after the award. According to him, Section 36 of the Arbitration Act (falling in Chapter VIII) which deals with the enforcement of the award,According to the learned Senior Counsel, the phrase used in sub-Section (3) that “subject to such conditions”would make it clear that the Court has complete discretion, though judicially guided, to grant a stay subject to such conditions that it“have due regard to” in the proviso to sub-Section (3) would apply to all provisions of the CPC including a money decree.Arbitration Act, all the relevant provisions of the CPC namely Order XLI Rule 5 would come into play. 11. Shri Grover has further submitted that while considering the stay of money decree, Order XXVII Rule 8A would directly be applicable, A B D E F G H 261 read with Order XLI Rule 5. He has emphasised on the use of word in the proviso to Section 36(3) of the Arbitration Act, which according to him makes a provision of CPC mandatorily to be applied used in Section 36(3) of the Arbitration Act is only with regard to discretion exercised by the High Court inegard to” in the proviso to Section 36(3) would mean the same to be mandatory because of the use of word shall in the opening 12. It has also been urged that Order XXVII Rule 8A deals with operation of stay in respect of suits against Government, which is distinct. He has further submitted that under Order XLI Rule 5(3), substantial loss has to be shown by the, failing which, stay would not be granted, but in view of the provisions of Order XXVII Rule 8A the Government, when the genus (security) itself is not to be furnished by the Government. 13. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the material on record. For proper appreciation of the facts ofArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Code of Civil Procedure, 1908are reproduced hereunder: PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 262 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 9 S.C.R. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. “Section 18.

(2) Where an application to set aside the arbitral award has been filed in the Court under section 34, the filing of such anender that award unenforceable, unless the Court grants an order of stay of the operation of the said arbitral award in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3), on a separate application made for that Upon filing of an application under sub-section (2) for stay of the operation of the arbitral award, the Court may, subject to such conditions as it may deem fit, grant stay of the operation of such award for reasons to be recorded in writing: Provided that the Court shall, while considering the application for grant of stay in the case of an arbitral award for payment of money, have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).” 1 Subs. by Act 3 of 2016, sec. 19, for section 36, for section 36 (w.r.e.f. 23-10-2015). Section 36, before substitution, stood as under: “36. Enforcement. —Where the time for making an application to set aside A B D E F G H 263 CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, 1908. No such security as is mentioned in rules 5 and 6 of Order XLI shall be requiredfrom the Government or, where the Government has undertaken the defence of the suit, from any public officer sued in respect of an act alleged to be done by him in his official capacity.” “Order XLI, Rule 1y appeal shall be preferred in the form of a memorandum signed by the appellant or his pleader and presented to the Court or to such officer as it appoints in this behalf. Theovided that where two or more suits have been tried together and a common judgment has been delivered therefore and two or more appeals are filed against any decree covered by that judgment, whether by the same appellant or by different appellants, the Appellate Court may dispense with the filinge than one copy of the judgments. (2)Contents of memorandum.—The memorandum shall set forth, concisely and under distinct heads, the grounds of objection to the decree appealed from without any argument or narrative; and such grounds shall be numbered consecutively. (3) Where the appeal is against a decree for payment of money, the appellant shall, within such time as the Appellate Court may allow, deposit, the amount disputed in the appeal or furnish such security in respect thereof as the Court may think fit.” “Order XLI, Rule 5 Stay by Appellate Court.— (1) An appeal shall not operate as a stay of proceedings under a decree or order appealed from except so far as the Appellate PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 264 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 9 S.C.R. Court may order, nor shall execution of a decree be stayed by reason only of an appeal having been preferred from the decree; but the Appellate Court may for sufficient cause order stay of execution of such decree.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub- rules, where the appellant fails to make the deposit or furnish the security specified in sub-rule (3) of rule 1, the Court shall not make an order staying the execution of the decrees.” (emphasis supplied) A B D E F G H 265 14. Section 36 of the Arbitration Act was amended/substituted vide Act 3 of 2016 with retrospective effect from 23.10.2015.Sub-Section (3) of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act was introduced on the recommendation of 246th Law Commission Report which reads as under:- AUTOMATIC STAY OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD UPON ADMISSION OF CHALLENGEAct makes it clear that an arbitral award becomes enforceable as a decree only after the time for filing a petition under section 34 has expired or after the section 34 petition has been dismissed. In other words, the pendency of a section 34 petition renders an arbitral award unenforceable. The Supreme Court, in National Aluminum Co. Ltd. V. Pressteel& Fabrications, (2004) 1 SCC 540 held that by virtue of section 36, it was impermissible to pass ander directing the losing party to deposit any part of the award into Court. While this decision was in relation to the powers of the Supreme Court to pass such an order under section 42, the Bombay High Court in Afcons Infrastructure Limited v. The Board of Trustees, Port of Mumbai 2014 (1) Arb LR 512 (Bom) applied the same principle to the powersefore, virtually paralyzes the process for the winning party/award creditor. 44. The Supreme Court, in National Aluminium, has criticized the present situation in the following words: “However, we do notice that this automatic suspension of the execution of the award, the moment an application challenging the said award is filed under section 34 of the Act leaving no discretion in the court to put the parties on terms, in our opinion, defeats the very objective of theesolution system to which arbitration belongs. We do find that there is a recommendation made by the concerned Ministry to the Parliament to amend sectionoposal to empower the civil court to pass suitable interim orders in such cases. In view of the urgency of such amendment, we sincerely hope that necessary steps would be PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 266 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 9 S.C.R. taken by the authorities concerned at the earliest to bringequired change in law.” 45. In order to rectify this mischief, certain amendments have been suggested by the Commission to section 36 of the Act,ovide that the award will not become unenforceable merely upon the making of an application under section 34. In essence, the Law Commissionhas categorically recommended that there should be no automatic stay of the arbitral award. While so 15. The amended Section 36 of the Arbitration Act provides for: (a) after expiry of making an application to set aside the arbitral award (i.e. 90 days from the award) the award shall be enforced as if it, which may be subject to such conditions as it may deem fit; (d) whilehave due regard” to the provisions of CPC for grant of stay of money decree. 16. The backbone of the submissions on behalf of the respondent- State of West Bengal is that under the provisions of Order XXVII Rule 8A of the CPC, no security shall be required from the Government in.If such submission of the respondent is accepted then the same would mean that mere filing of anArbitration Act by a Government shall render the award unenforceable as the stay order would be passed in a. If the contention is accepted, the effect would be that insofar as the Government isArbitration Act would automatically come into force. 17. In this backdrop, we have now to consider the effect of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act, vis-a-vis the provisions of Order XXVII Rule 8A of CPC. Sub-Section (3) of Section 36 of the Arbitration Act mandates A B D E F G H 267 that while considering an application for stay filed along with or afterArbitration Act, if stay is to be granted then it shall be subject to such conditions as may be deemedThe proviso makes it clear that the Court has to “have due regard to the provisions for grant of stay of a money decree under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure”. The phrase “have due regard to” would only mean that the provisions of CPC are to be taken into consideration,and.While considering the phrase “having regard to”, this Court in the case of Shri Sitaram Sugar Company Limited.v. Union of India(1990)3 SCC 223 has held that “the words ‘having regard to’ in sub-section are the legislative instruction for the general guidance of the Government in determining the price of sugar. They are not strictly mandatory, but in essence directory.”. 18. In our view, in the present context, the phrase used is ‘having regard to’ the provisions of CPC and not ‘in accordance with” the provisions of CPC. In the latter case, it would have been mandatory, but in the form as mentioned in Rule 36(3) of the Arbitration Act, it would only be directory or as a guiding factor. Mere reference to CPC in the said Section 36 cannot be construed in such a manner that it takes awayArbitration Act) itself. It is to be taken as a general guideline, which will not make the main provisionArbitration Act inapplicable. The provisions of CPC are to be followed as a guidance, whereas the provisions of the Arbitration Act are essentially to be first applied. Since, the Arbitration Act is a self- contained Act, the provisions of the CPC will apply only insofar as the same are not inconsistent with the spirit and provisions of the Arbitration Act. 19. A Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court, while considering the question as to whether in an appeal preferred by the Government, “36. In order to resolve the aforesaid controversy, one must examine the legislative intent for incorporating Order 27, Rule PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 268 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 9 S.C.R. 8A in the Code. The aforesaid provision was engrafted to exempt the Government to furnish security as a guaranteeee as mentioned in Rules 5 and 6 of Order XLI. Notwithstanding such exemption, discretionary power of the Court to grant stay of execution of a decree can be exercised in favour of the Appellant Government only if it satisfies the Court as to the existence ofder XLI. As “substantial loss” to the appellant is a condition precedent to grant stay, execution of a money decree is ordinarily not stayed since satisfaction of a money decree does not amount to irreparable injury to the appellant as the remedy of restitution is available to him in the event the appeal is allowed. [See,Sihor Nagareau v. BhabhlubhaiVirabhai, 2005 (4) SCC 1, para 6]. Under such circumstances, when the court chooses to exercise its discretion in favour of the appellant State to grant stay of execution of a money decree it must be balance the equities between the parties and ensure that no undue hardship is caused to a decree holder due to stay of execution of such decree. Hence, in appropriate cases, the Court in its discretion may direct deposit of a part of the decretal sum so that the decree holder may with draw the same without prejudice and subject to the result of the appeal. Such direction for deposit of the decretal sum is not for the purpose of furnishing security for due performance of the decreebut an equitable measure ensuring part satisfaction of the decree without prejudice to the parties and subject to the result of the appeal as a condition for stay of execution of the decree. 37. To hold that the Court is denuded of such equitable discretion while granting stay of execution of a money decree in favour of the Government, would cause grave hardship to deserving decree holders who in the facts of a given case may be entitled to enjoy part satisfaction of the decree without prejudice and subject to the result of the appeal as a condition for stay of execution of the entire decree. 38. Hence, it is opined although Order 27, Rule 8A may exempt the appellant Government from the mandatory obligation of furnishing security in terms of Rule 1(3) for seeking stay of A B D E F G H 269 execution of a money decree as under Rule 5(5) of Order XLI, the said provision cannot be said to operate as an absolute clog on the discretion of the court to direct the deposit of the decretal amount as a condition for grant of stay of execution of the decree in appropriate cases more particularly when such direction is coupled with the liberty to the decree holder to withdraw a portion thereof in part satisfaction of the decree without prejudice and subject to the result of the appeal.” We find no reason to disagree with such view taken by the Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court and are thus in agreement with the 20. Even otherwise a plain reading of Order XXVII Rule 8A of CPC would make it clear that the same is only regarding security as, does not provide that the decretal amount cannot be required to be deposited in the appeal against a money 21. It is also noteworthy that when Order XXVII Rule 8A of CPC was incorporated in the year 1937, at that time Rule 5 of OrderAct 104 of 1976 w.e.f. 01.02.1977. Prior to that, it was sub-Rule (3) (c) of Rule 5 aforesaid which provided that no order for, in 1976 Sub Rule (5) to Rule 5 of Order XLI CPC was inserted, which reads as follows: (5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub- rules, where the appellant fails to make the deposit or furnish the security specified in sub-rule (3) of rule 1, the Court shall not make an order staying the execution of the decrees.” PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 270 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 9 S.C.R. The same provides for making of deposit or furnishing security by the decree holder seeking stay. It would thus mean that after 1977, the Appellate Court had the power to direct for deposit of the decretal amount, 22. Further, it is to be noticed that Order XXVII Rule 8A of CPC was inserted in 1937 when the British Crown was ruling our country. The same was brought in during the period of British Raj to protect thetate of West Bengal was carrying on trade as owner and occupier of a market in Calcutta (now Kolkata) without obtaining a license asAct, 1951,a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Superintendent & Legal Remembrancer, State of West Bengal v. Corporation of Calcutta (1967) 2 SCC 170 considered the question as to whether this Court should adopt the rule of construction accepted by the Privy Council intatute vis-a-vis the Crown and held that “There are many reasons why the said rule of construction is inconsistent with and incongruous in the present set-up we have no Crown, the archaic rule based on the prerogative and perfection of the Crown has no relevance to a democratic republic; it is inconsistent with the rule of law based on the doctrine of equality.” 23. In our considered view, the provision which was incorporated in the year 1937 during the British Raj, giving certain safeguards to thes time, when we have a democratic Government. 24. Arbitration proceedings are essentially alternate dispute redressal system meant for early/quick resolution of disputes and in caseArbitrator against the Government is allowed to be automatically stayed, the very purpose ofArbitration Act. The Arbitration A B D E F G H 271 Act is a special Act which provides for quick resolution of disputes between the parties and Section 18 of the Act makes it clear that the parties shall be treated with equality.Once the Act mandates so, there cannot be any special treatment givento the Government as a party. As such, under the scheme of the Arbitration Act, no distinction is made nor any differential treatment is to be given to the Government, whileArbitration Act. As we have already mentioned above, the reference to CPC in Section 36 of the Arbitration Act is only to guide the Court as to what conditions can be imposed, andArbitration Act. 25. It may be true that the CPC provides for a differential treatment to the Government in certain cases, but the samemay not be so applicableArbitration Act. For instance, Section 80 of CPC provides for a notice of two monthsto, it is also provides that no ex-parte injunction order can be passed againstWhereas on the other hand, under the Arbitration Act no such special provision has been made with regard to arbitration by orThere is no requirement under the Arbitration Act for a notice of two monthsto be given to the Government before, Sections 9 and 17 of the Arbitration Act also provide for grant of ex-parte interim orders against the Government. 26. Section 36 of the Arbitration Act also does not provide for any special treatment to the Government while dealing with grant of stay inArbitration Act. Keeping the aforesaid in consideration and also the provisions of Section, make it clear that there is no exceptional treatment to be given to the GovernmentArbitration Act. 27. Although we are of the firm view that the archaic Rule 8A of Order XXVII CPC has no application or reference in the present times,, whereas under Order XLI PAM DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LTD. v. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [VINEET SARAN, J.] A B D E F G H 272 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 9 S.C.R. Rule 5 of CPC, the Court has the power to directfor full or part deposit, which would not restrict the Court from directing deposit of the awarded amount and part thereof. 28. For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the impugned order passed by the Calcutta High Court granting unconditional. Accordingly, we allow these appeals and quash the order dated 13.12.2018 passed by the Calcutta High Court and restoretate of West Bengal). As already directed by order dated 03.10.2018, it shall be open for the 29. No order as to costs. Ankit Gyan Appeals allowed.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
