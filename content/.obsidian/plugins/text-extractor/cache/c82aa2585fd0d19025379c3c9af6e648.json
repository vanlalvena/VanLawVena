The position can be summed up thus: The insurer and the insured are bound by the conditions enumerated in the policy and the insurer is not liable to the insured if there is violation of a any policy condition. But the insurer who is made statutorily liable to pay compensation to third parties on account of the certificate of insurance issued shall be entitled to recover from the insured the amount paid to the third parties, if there was any breach of policy conditions on account of the vehicle being driven without a valid driving licence. Learned counsel for the insured contended that it is enough if he establishes that he made all due enquiries b and believed bona fide that the driver employed by him had a valid driving licence, in which case there was no breach of the policy condition. As we have not decided on that contention it is open to the insured to raise it before the Claims Tribunal. In the present case, if the Insurance Company succeeds in establishing that there was breach of the policy condition, the Claims Tribunal shall direct the insured to pay that amount to the insurer. In default c the insurer shall be allowed to recover that amount (which the insurer is directed to pay to the claimant third parties) from the insured person. 26. We may point out that as per the order passed by this Court on 6-3- 2000, the appellant Insurance Company was directed to pay the award amount to the claimants. We are told that the amount was paid by the appellant to the claimants. Now the Claims Tribunal has to decide the next d question whether the Insurance Company is entitled to recover that amount from the owner of the vehicle on account of the vehicle being driven by a person who had no valid licence to drive the vehicle. For that purpose we remit the case to the Claims Tribunal. An opportunity shall be afforded to the parties concerned for adducing evidence in that regard. We make it clear that the claimants shall not be bothered during the remaining part of the e proceedings. 27. The appeals are disposed of in the above terms.

He also filed a complaint at police station in Bhagalpur against deceased's husband Band four others alleging commission of offence under Sections 304-B, 498-A, 120-B and 406 IPC. In the complaint petition he narrated the chain of events starting from 9-6-1994, the date on which his daughter was married to B till 12-6-1997, the date on which he received the message that his daughter had received bum injuries, and who ultimately died on 20-6-1997. The police on completion of investigation filed the charge-sheet on 3-4-1999. Immediately after filing of the charge-sheet and before the Magistrate took up the matter and passed any order in the criminal proceeding, the accused persons approached the High Court, assailing the territorial jurisdiction of the Magistrate at Bhagalpur to try the offence under Section 304-B IPC. It was contended that under Section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an offence could be enquired into and tried by the Court in whose local jurisdiction it was committed and consequently on the basis of allegations made in the FIR as well as the complaint filed, the incident constituting the alleged offence under Section 304-B being at Jahanaganj (Azamgarh) in the State of Uttar Pradesh, the Magistrate at Bhagalpur in the State of Bihar will have no territorial jurisdiction to try the offence. The Single Judge of the High Court, while rejecting the contention based on Section 177, relied on Section 220 CrPC and considering narration of events culminating in death of the deceased which constituted offence under Section 304-B IPC, came to the conclusion that there was a continuity of action to attract Section 220(1), and therefore, it cannot be said that the jurisdiction of the Magistrate at Bhagalpur was ousted to try the offence under Section 304-B. The High Court also casually observed that the assertions made prima facie constituted an offence under Section 498-A and since the accused had approached the Court even before the Magistrate had applied his mind to the result of the investigation on the basis of the allegations made by the informant/complainant, it would not be appropriate to express any definite opinion on the same. On behalf of the accused it was argued that from the tenor of the impugned judgment, it could well be imagined that the judgment was rather a strained one and had been passed in view of the earlier directions and the incident constituting the offence under Section 304-B could not be held to be one falling under Section 220 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, so as to be tried along with the offence under Section 406 at Bhagalpur.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MOHAN BAITHA V. STATE OF BIHAR (Pattanaik, J.) 353 1999. On the basis of an FIR dated 4-7-1998 by one Surendra Rajak at Police Station Nath N agar in the district of Bhagalpur, the police registered a case under Sections 304-B/34/406 IPC. The said Surendra Rajak also filed a complaint in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bhagalpur against Dr Binod Kumar and four others, alleging the commission of offence against those five persons under Sections 304-B, 498-A, 120-B and 406 IPC. The complainant, Surendra Rajak, was the father of the deceased Kalpana and in the complaint petition, he narrated the chain of events starting from 9-6- 1994, the date on which Kalpana was married to Binod Kumar till 12-6- 1997, the date on which the father received a telephonic message that Kalpana had received bum injuries, while preparing milk for her daughter and ultimately Kalpana died on 20-6-1997. As the police did not proceed with the investigation in right earnest, Surendra Rajak had filed a writ petition, which was registered as Criminal Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 766 of 1998. Even earlier to that writ petition, a learned Single Judge of the Patna High Court had directed by an order dated 28-1-1999 that the Superintendent of Police, Bhagalpur should submit a report, under what circumstances the accused persons have not been arrested yet. Rajak had all along apprehended that the investigation had not been proper, as the higher police officials tried to shield the accused persons. The police, however on completion of investigation, ultimately filed the charge-sheet on 3-4-1999. Before the Magistrate took any further action in the criminal proceedings, the accused persons filed an application in the High Court, seeking a direction to the Magistrate, not to proceed with the matter. One of the grounds taken before the High Court was that since the incident constituting the offence punishable under Section 304-B IPC had taken place at Jahanaganj in the State of Uttar Pradesh, the Court at Bhagalpur lacks territorial jurisdiction to try the same. The High Court by the impugned judgment having dismissed the same, the accused persons have approached this Court. 3. At the outset, it may be noticed that immediately after filing of the charge-sheet and before the Magistrate took up the matter and passed any order in the criminal proceeding, the accused persons approached the High Court, assailing the territorial jurisdiction of the Magistrate at Bhagalpur to try the offence under Section 304-B IPC. 4. Mr P.S. Mishra, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the accused persons contended that under Section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an offence could be enquired into and tried by the Court in whose local jurisdiction it was committed and consequently on the basis of allegations made in the FIR as well as the complaint filed, the incident constituting the alleged offence under Section 304-B being at Jahanaganj (Azamgarh) in the State of Uttar Pradesh, the Magistrate at Bhagalpur in the State of Bihar will not have territorial jurisdiction to try the offence. Mr Mishra also further contended that on the basis of allegations made, no offence under Section 406 IPC can be said to have been constituted. On examining the assertions in the FIR and the complaint as well as on scrutinising the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Patna High Court, which is the subject-matter of challenge, we do not find any substance in either of the contentions raised by ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 354 SUPREME COURT CASES c2001) 4 sec Mr Mishra. So far as the contention relating to the constitution of an offence under Section 406 is concerned, we are not required to examine the same, since the accused never assailed the criminal proceedings itself on the ground a that no offence under Section 406 IPC can be said to have been committed. The accused merely assailed the territorial jurisdiction of the criminal court at Bhagalpur in relation to offence under Section 304-B on the ground that the said offence stood committed in Uttar Pradesh. Section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on which Mr Mishra relies, uses the expression \"ordinarily\". The use of the word \"ordinarily\" indicates that the provision is a b general one and must be read subject to the special provisions contained in the Criminal Procedure Code. That apart, this Court has taken the view that the exceptions implied by the word \"ordinarily\" need not be limited to those specially provided for by the law and exceptions may be provided by law on considerations of convenience or may be implied from other provisions of law permitting joint trial of offences by the same court (see Purushottamdas c Dalmia v. State ofW.B. 1, L.N. Mukherjee v. State of Madras2 and Banwarilal Jhunjhunwala v. Union of India3 ). Even the Law Commission in its 41st Report had observed that the general rule laid down in Section 177 is neither exclusive nor peremptory. The learned Single Judge while dismissing the contention raised by the accused has relied upon Section 220 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and considering the narration of events culminating in d the death of Kalpana, which constitutes offence under Section 304-B IPC, the learned Single Judge has come to a conclusion that there appears to exist a continuity of action to attract sub-section (1) of Section 220, and therefore, it cannot be said that the jurisdiction of the Magistrate at Bhagalpur is ousted to try the offence under Section 304-B. The High Court has also casually observed that the assertions made prima facie constitute an offence under e Section 498-A and since the accused had approached the Court even before the Magistrate had applied his mind to the result of the investigation on the basis of the allegations made by the informant/complainant, it would not be appropriate to express any definite opinion on the same. According to Mr Mishra, from the tenor of the impugned judgment, it can be well imagined that the judgment is rather a strained one and has been passed in view of the earlier directions and by no stretch of imagination, the incident constituting f the offence under Section 304-B can be held to be one falling under Section 220 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, so as to be tried along with the offence under Section 406 at Bhagalpur. It may be noticed that under Section 220 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, offences more than one committed by the same persons could be tried at one trial, if they can be held to be in one series of acts, so as to form the same transaction. The expression g \"same transaction\" from its very nature is incapable of an exact definition. It is not intended to be interpreted in any artificial or technical sense.
