The goods with which we are concerned being declared goods, they can only be taxed at a single point, a that is, only one sale in the State can be subjected to tax. It is for the State to determine whether the single point should be the point of first sale in the State or the last sale in the State or any intermediate sale in the State. If the single point is fixed by the State at, say, the point of first sale and the State exempts the first sale from payment of tax, either by a general provision or a specific provision applicable to a class of seller, the particular seller or the b goods sold may not be subjected to tax at either that point of first sale or any subsequent sale in the State. 13. The Second Schedule of the State Act specifies the single point; it is \"the point of first sale in the State\". The first sale in the State was the sale by the said Board to the appellants/petitioners. That sale was exempt from tax by reason of the notification dated 1-12-1982 aforementioned. The iron and c steel sold by the said Board to the appellants/petitioners was, therefore, not liable to tax either at the point of first sale or any subsequent sale in the State. 14. There is no warrant for the emphasis that would appear to have been placed by the Madras High Court on the phrase \"taxable sale\". The State Act d does not fix the single point of the levy at the first taxable sale; it fixes it at \"the point of first sale\". The impugned circular cannot validly shift the point of levy from the first sale to a subsequent sale and it is, therefore, bad in law. 15. The appeals and writ petitions are allowed and the circular dated 29-1-1993 is set aside. No orders as to costs. (1998) 5 Supreme Court Cases 354 (BEFORE S.C. AGRAWAL AND S. RAJENDRA BABU, JJ.)

This appeal arises out of an order made by the High Court of Bombay affirming an order made by the trial Judge in a summary suit filed under Order 37 of CPC whereby the trial Judge had issued summons for judgment and made it absolute against the appellants and consequently passed a decree against them for a sum of Rs 37,51,519.43 with interest and certain other g incidental charges. A suit was brought by the respondents on the basis of bills of exchange in respect of which the appellants are the acceptors. M/s Khanna Sales Corporation are the drawees of the bill who have local bill discounting facility with the respondents . Under the said facility, Mis Khanna Sales Corporation discounted the bills of exchange. The respondent- Bank made payments to Mis Khanna Sales Corporation on the basis of the h bills of exchange.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 356 SUPREME COURT CASES (1998) 5 sec the stipulated time and since demand did not come forth despite notice of demand, the respondent-Bank filed a summary suit as aforesaid. Nine bills of exchange had been drawn by Mis Khanna Sales Corporation. The a appellants before us sought leave to defend themselves contending that the bills of exchange were executed without consideration as neither the goods were sold nor supplied in the transaction in question. The appellants alleged fraud, collusion and connivance between the officers of the respondent-Bank and Mis Khanna Sales Corporation. The learned trial Judge refused the leave to defend the suit. On appeal, the Division Bench considered the matter and b held that the undisputed position is that the appellants are the acceptors of the bills of exchange in question and that no goods were supplied or actually sold by Mis Khanna Sales Corporation to the appellants and, therefore, the bills of exchange were not supported by consideration. Section 43 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 saves the right of the holder in due course like the respondent to claim the amount of bill of exchange. In certain other c instances the bills of exchange had been negotiated through the Bank without any difficulty and, therefore, the Division Bench was of the view that there is no logic in the submission made on behalf of the appellants. If any fraud has been alleged that could be reflective on their conduct and, therefore, it would be too much for the respondent-Bank or their officers to be instrumental in perpetration of such a fraud by the appellants and M/s d Khanna Sales Corporation and, therefore, the appellants cannot escape their liability and responsibility under the bills of exchange in question. On that basis they took the view that pleas raised by the appellants were frivolous and have no substance and merits in their defence. 3. In this appeal it is contended that what should be examined at the e stage of grant of leave to defend is whether there was a real or a sham defence and whether the facts alleged by the appellants if established would be a good defence and the trial court should not go into the question whether the facts alleged were true or not, as that situation would arise only after leave was granted and at the trial. That a condition as to security could be imposed if the Court was of the opinion that the defence was put forward f with a view to prolong this suit. 4. The position in law has been explained by this Court in Santosh Kumar v. Bhai Mool Singh 1, Milkhiram (India) (P) Ltd. v. Chamanlal Bros. 2 and Mechelec Engineers & Manufacturers v. Basic Equipment Corpn. 3 The propositions laid down in these decisions may be summed up as follows: (a) If the defendant satisfies the court that he has a good defence to g the claim on merits, the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend. 1 AIR 1958 SC 321: 1958 SCR 1211 : (1958) 1 MLJ (SC) 159 2 AIR 1965 SC 1698 3 (1976) 4 sec 687: AIR 1977 SC 577 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(b) If the defendant raises a triable issue indicating that he has a fair or bona fide or reasonable defence, although not a possibly good defence, the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend. (c) If the defendant discloses such facts as may be deemed sufficient to entitle him to defend, that is, if the affidavit discloses that at the trial he may be able to establish a defence to the plaintiff's claim, the court may impose conditions at the time of granting leave to defend - the conditions being as to time of trial or mode of trial but not as to payment into court or furnishing security. (d) If the defendant has no defence, or if the defence is sham or illusory or practically moonshine, the defendant is not entitled to leave to defend. (e) If the defendant has no defence or the defence is illusory or sham or practically moonshine, the court may show mercy to the defendant by enabling him to try to prove a defence but at the same time protect the plaintiff imposing the condition that the amount claimed should be paid into court or otherwise secured. In fact in identical matters on the file of the said High Court in Summary Suit No. 2963 of 1990 Dena Bank v. Sunil Enterprises and Summary Suit No. 1153 of 1989 Bank of India v. Mahendra Sarabhai Choksi, leave to defend had been granted to the defendants. 5. In those cases the circumstances arising are that the bills of exchange were accepted by the defendant even though they had already discharged earlier bills of exchange as and when they were due and the Bank had e continued to pay out such large amounts of bills of exchange accepted by the party who is already a defaulter. It is also contended that some of the bills of exchange were mere secondary documents and, therefore, these matters require examination. It cannot be said that the defence raised by the appellants is totally defenceless or moonshine or illusory as noticed earlier in the course of this order. Therefore, the view taken by the High Court that f the appellants have absolutely no prima facie case, may not be correct. And in the circumstances, we allow the appeals, set aside the order made by the Division Bench and the Judge on the original side of the Bombay High Court and dismiss the summons for judgment, grant leave and direct unconditional leave to the defendant to defend the suit. Appeals, therefore, stand allowed accordingly. g h","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
