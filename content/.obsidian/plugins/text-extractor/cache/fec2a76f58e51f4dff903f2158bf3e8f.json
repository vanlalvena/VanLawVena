Section 23-A is a law returning to the public what it has taken from the public, by enabling the committee to utilise the amount for the performance of services required of it under the Act, mstead of allowing middlemen to profiteer by ill-gotten gains. The constitutional validity of Section 23-A has therefore lo be upheld. (Paras 13 and 14) Walaiti Ram Mahabir Parshad v. State of Punjab, AIR 1984 P & H 120 ; P.P. Kutti Keya v.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by 0. CHINNAPPA REDDY, J.-The appellants, who are traders engaged in the purchase and sale of agricultural produce, appear to be a determined Jot. For over a decade, they or those similarly placed have been litigating and impeding the levy and collection of market fee by the Market Committees constituted under the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act. Some times they have been successful, some- times they have not. One of the occasions when they appeared to be successful was when this Court in Kewal Krishan Puri v. State of Pu11jab1 declared that the enhancement of the fee from 2% to 3% was illegal. The Court while striking down the enhancement of the fee laid down no new principle but made certain general observations which, we r~ret to say, have been so misunderstood and mis- interpreted as to lead to some confusion and public mischief. The misunderstanding and confusion have aJso naturaJly led to more litiga- tion. Fortunately, in Sree11ivasa General Traders v. State of Andhra Pradesh';!., this Court has removed much of the misunderstanding, cleared many of the cobwebs and retrieved the situation. 1. AlR 1980 SC 1008: (1980) l sec 416 2.

Before we proceed to consider the question at issue in the present case, it will be fair to recall the object and purpose of the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act and similar enactments in force in other States. Far back in 1953, Rajamannar, C.J. and 1'.L. Yenkatarama Aiyar, J., in P.P. Kulli Keya v. Sime of Madras'\\ considered the provisions of the Madras Commercial· Crops Markets Act, 1933, one of the forerunners of the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act and other similar enactments elsewhere. The general nature of the legislation was explained by Venkatarama Aiyar, J., as follows: ... the subject-matter of the impugned Act is marketing and legislation on marketing is now a well-recognised feature of all commercial countnes. The need for such a legislation arises whenever society passes on from the stage of self-supporting economic unit, pr0<1uc.ing only articles for its own consumption to that of a commercial community producing articles for sale in outside areas for profit. While m the former stage, transactions would be general1y settled directly between the seller and the purchaser, the price being paid and delivery of the commodity taken at the time of the deal, the conditions would be different when commercial crops are begun to be raised. The ultimate purchasers of these commodities would generally be persons out- side the area of production, a merchant residing in another Stale and even in a foreign country. To bring about a deal between the local producers and the outside purcnasers, there emerged a class of mid(;ilemen. Even in well-organised and economically advanced countries like England, 1t was found that the agriculturist producer had not facilities for disposing of the goods to his best ad vantage ( vide the statement of Dr Addison. Minister for Agriculture, quoted at page 80 of the Indian Central Bankmg Ellquiry Commillee Report, Vol. l, Part 11). lt is these conditions that have led up to the enactment of marketing laws in all countries having a large volume of trade in commercial crops. The object of this legislation is to protect the producers of commercial crops from being exploited by middlemen and profiteers and to enable them to secure a fair return for their produce. The need for such legislation is even greater in India as the producers are as a class illiterate and economically dependent and unstable. This question had engaged the attention of several committees which had been constituted to report on various economic matters. Indian Cotton was a commodity greatly in 3.

J.) 349 demand in England and other countries and in the Central Pro- vinces and Berar open markets for cotton were established through legislation. In 1919, the Indian Cotton Committee observed in their report that the marketing system afforded great protection to the producers and that special legislation should be under- taken to establish such markets in every cotton growing area. The Royal Commission on Agriculture in India recorded a considerable body of evidence on the state of the trade in food crops and it showed the need for legislative actioo for safeguard- ing the interests of the producers ( vide report dated 1928). In 1931 the Indian Central Banking Enquiry Committee con- sidered in Chapter VII of its report the conditions with reference to marketing . It is therein pointed out that the village producer was seldom able to _get a proper price because he was chronically indebted to the middlemen who advanced loans on the security of the crops to be ~own and were thus in a position to dictate their own terms and that the bargains were seldom fair to the se1ler. It was also observed that for want of facilities for ware- housin_g the produce. the grower was not in a position to wait and sell the commodities for prooer price ( vide pages 78 and 79). Tn J 933 the Act now under consideration was passed with the obiect of providinJ! for \"the better regulation of buying and c;eJHng of commercial crops and the establishment of markets for commercial crops\". It must be mentioned that at that time the only products which had become commercial crops having an international market were cotton, groundnJJts and tobacco. and the definition of commercial crops as enacted originally com- prised only these three crops . • • • Various suggestions were made for improving the market conditions (vide op . 92 and 93).

Madras, Hyderabad and Madhya Pradesh. it throws out several sugf!estions for future improvements. It must be added that there has been le~slation on lines similar to those of the Madras Act in several of the States in India. It will be clear from the above survey of the marketing legislation that its obiect is to enable producers to get a fair price for their commodities and that it has been generally adopted in alJ commercial States.

Under the Indian Constitution, they must be upheld under Article 19(6) as reason- able and enacted in the interests of the general public. J. The decision of the Madras High Court in P.P. Kutti Keya v. State of Madras8 was affirmed by a Constitution Be11ch of the Supreme Court in M.C.V.S. Arunachala Nadar v. State of Madras'. Subba Rao, J. referring to the background of the Act, observed : There is a historical background for this Act. Marketing legislation is now a well-settled feature of all commercial countries. The object of such legislation is to protect the producers t>f com- mercial crops from being exploited by the middlemen and profiteers and to enable them to secure a fair return for their produce. In Madras State, as in other parts of the country, various Commissions and Committees have been appointed to investigate the problem, to suggest ways and means of providing a fair deal to the growers of crops, particularly commercial crops, and find a market for selling their produce at proper rates. Several Committees, in their reports, considered this question and suggested that a satisfactory system of agricultural market- ing should be introduced to achieve the object of helping the agriculturists to secure a proper retum for the produce grown by them. The learned Judge then referred to the report of the Royal Commission on Agriculture in India, the report of the Expert Committee appointed by the Government of Madras, and proceeded to observe : With a view to provide satisfactory conditions for the growers of commercial crops to sell their produce on equal terms and at reasonable prices, the Act was passed on July 25, 1933. The preamble introduces the Act with the recital that it is expedient to provide for the better regulation of the buying and selling of commercial c~ps in the Presidency of Madras and for that purpose to establish market and make rules for their proper administration. The Act, therefore, was the result of a long exploratory investigation by experts in the field, conceived and enacted to regulate the buying and selling of commercial crops by providing suitable and regulated markets by eliminating middle men and bringing face to face the producer and the buyer so that they may meet on equal terms, thereby eradicating or at any rate reducing the scope for exploitation in dealings.

Till such markets are established, the said provisions, by imposing licensing restrictions, enable the buyers and sellers to meet in licensed premises, ensure correct weighment, make available to them reliable market information and provide for them a simple machinery for settlement of disputes. After the markets are built or opened by the marketing committees, within a reasonable radius from the market, as prescribed by the Rules, no licence is issued ; thereafter a11 growers will have to resort to the market for vending their goods. The result of the implemen~ati.on of the Act would be to eliminate, as far as possible, the middle- men and to give reasonable facilities for the growers of com- mercial crops to secure best prices for their commodities. 4. In lmmedisetti Ramkrishnaiah Sons v. State of A.P. 8 , the nature of the duties of a Market Committee was explained : Another unfounded assumption of the learned counsel was that the activities of the Market Committee and the facilities pro- vided by it were confined by the Act to the market area only.

They are services which are required to be performed by the Market Committee and which may be rendered throughout the notified market area without being confined to the market. Further, the facilities provided in the market are available for the use of eyery grower of agri- cultural produce and owner of livestock within the notified market area. It is too much to expect the Market Committee to provide the same facilities as are available in the market area in every nook and comer of the notified market area. It is up to the growers of agricultural produce and owners of livestock to avail themselves of the facilities afforded in the market. None can complain against the levy of licence fees on the ground that some may not avail themselves of the facilities available in the market. S. lmmedisetti Ramkrishnaiah Sons v. State of A.P. 8 was approved by this Court in Sreenivasa General Traders v. State of A.P. 7 , where it was observed : (SCC pp. 373, 374, paras 19, 21, 22) It is obviously in the interests of the producers of agri- cultural produce that they can get the best competitive prices in an open market and that they have not to pay the middlemen. Sale or purchase of agricultural produce in such a market under the supervision and control of the market committee is likely to be in ready cash and therefore advantageous to the producers and the use of standard weight must eliminate the possibility of his being victimized by malpractices. Supervision of the opera- tions in the notified market area can be more conveniently done if business is carried on in a specified area or areas intended for that purpose. The Act is an integrated one and it regulates the buying and sel1ing of notified agricultural produce, livestock and products of livestock from a centralized place . • • • The contention that there is no liability on the petitioners to pay market fee on transactions of saJe and purchase of notified agricultural produce, livestock and products of livestock proceeds on a wrongful assumption that they can sti11 carry on such trade from their premises in the notified market area, but outside the market in that area. In view of the express prohibition contained in sub-section ( 6) of Section 7. the petitioners cannot carry on such trade by not resorting to the market proper . • • • There is a fallacy underlying the argument that since the services are rendered by the market committees within the market 7.

The contention doer.; not take note of the fact that establishment of a regulated market for the purchase or sale of notified agricultural produce, livestock or products of livestock is itself a service rendered to persons engaged in the business of purchase or sale of such commodities. The duty of a market committee constituted under sub-section ( 1 ) of Section 4 of the Act does not end with establishing such number of markets in the - notified market area under the first part of sub-section ( 3) but also extends to the providing of . such facilities in the market as the Government may from time to time by general or special order specify under the second part of sub-section (3). In exercise of their powers under Section 33 of the Act, the State Government have framed the Andhra Pradesh ( Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets Rules, 1969. Chapter V relates to 'Regulation of trading'. It would appear that Rules 48 to 53 are the machinery provisions for controlling the trade in notified agricultural produce, livestock and products of livestock in a notified area while Rules 54 to 73 impose restrictions on the carrying on of an such trade in such area. It is clear from the provisions of Section 15 of the Act that the services to be rendered by the market committee and facilities to be provided are not confined to the market proper but extend throughout the notified area. 6. The general scheme of the Punjab Agricultural produce Markets Act and the Act, as amended and in force in Haryana, are broadly on the same lines as the Madras and the Andhra Pradesh Acts and similar enactments in other States. Though we do not consider it necessary to refer to all the provisions of the Punjab and Haryana Acts, we think it may be appropriate to mention here those provisions of the Act which enumerate some of the duties and powers of the Market Committees constituted under the Acts and the purposes for which the Marketing Devefopment Fund and the Market Committee Fund may be expended. We may mention that while there is to be a State Agricultural Marketing Board for the entire State for performinp; the functions and duties assigned to the Board by the Act, the State Government may declare specified, notified areas as market areas for each of which there sha11 be a market committee.

It will be seen that Sections 26 and 28 cover a vast range of topics and are so wide as to take in a multitude of direct and indirect ways of achieving the principal object of the Act, namely, the better regulation of the purchase, sale, storage and processing of agricultural produce and the establishment of markets for agricultural produce. Some of the purposes for which the funds may be expended may on a first impression appear to be municipal or governmental functions, but a closer scrutiny wiH reveal that they are clearly associated with providing better facilities for marketing of agricultural produce. In fact, some of them may be municipal or governmental functions, but may yet be purposes for which the funds of the marketing board and marketing committees may be usefully, lawfully and perhaps necessarily expended. For example, it is of fundamental importance that there should be a network of roadways if effective aid is to be given to farmers to transport and market their produce. Section 23 of the Act enables the committee, subject to such rules as may be made by the State Government in that behalf, to levy on ad valorem basis; fee on the agricultural produce bought or sold by a licensee in tbe notified market area at a rate not exceeding the rate mentioned in Section 23 from time to time for every one hundred rupees. The fee which was originally 50 paise per 100 was raised to Re 1 per 100 in 1969, thereafter to Rs 1 ·50 in 1973 and to Rs 2·25 in 1974. Later the fee was raised to Rs 3 per 100. It was this enhancement of fee to Rs 3 per 100 that was challenged by several dealers from Punjab and Haryana in Kewal Krishan Puri v. State of Punjab 1 • A Constitution Bench of this Court, after referring to the principles laid down in the leading cases of Shirur Mutt8, Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. v. State of Orissa0 , Corporation of Calcutta v. Liberty Cinema 10 etc. thought that in all the circumstances of the case, an increase of the licence fee beyond Rs 2 per 100 was not justified. The Court noticed that each of the market committees had huge surpluses and had made large donations to educational institutions and expended funds for other purposes wholly unconnected with the pur- poses stipulated by the Act. It appeared that the increase from Rs 2 to Rs 3 in the year 197 8 was made largely to compensate the market committees for having contributed the huge sum of Rs one crore to the Medical College, Faridkot. Having regard to the huge surpluses 8. Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Labhmindra Thirtba Swamiar of Sri Sbirur Mutt, 1954 SCR 1005 : AIR 1954 SC 282 : 1954 SCl 335 9.

In the course of the discussion, Untwalia, J. who spoke for the Court made certain observations which when tom out of context appear to give rise to some misunderstanding. For example, at page 1016 of AIR, he said : (SCC p. 425, para 8) But generally and broadly speaking it must be ~hown with some amount of certainty, reasonableness or preponderance of probability that quite a substantial portion of the amount of fee realised is spent tor the special benefit of its payers. This sentence should not be read in isolation. It must be read in the context of the facts of the case. In fact, in the very sentence, pre- ceding the one quoted, it was said : (SCC p. 425, para 8) It may be so intimately connected or interwoven with the services rendered to others that it may not be possible to do a complete dichotomy and analysis as to what amount of special service was rendered to the payers of the fee and what proportion went to others . 7. That was why Sen, J. in Sreenivasa General Traders v. State of Andhra Pradesh~ took immense pains to explain the observations of Untwalia, J. and place them in their proper setting. He observed, very rightly indeed : (SCC p. 379, para 30) In the ultimate analysis, the Court held in Kewal Krishan Puri case 1 , that so long as the concept of fee remains distinct and linuted in contrast to tax, such expenditure of the amounts recovered by the levy of a market fee cannot be countenanced in law. A case is an authority only for what it actually decides and not for what may logically follow from it. Every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law but governed or qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. It would appear that there are certain observations to be found in the judgme.nt in Kewal Krishan Puri case1 which were really not necessary for purposes of the decision and go beyond the occasion and therefore they have no binding authority though they may have merely persuasive value.

Obviously Untwalia, J. did not purport to lay down any new principles and could not have intended to depart from the series of earlier cases of this Court. For instance, in H.H. Sudhundhra Thirtha Swamiar v. Commissioner for Hindu Religious & Charitable Endow- ments11 the Court had said : ... , nor is it a postulate of a fee that it must have direct relation to the actual services rendered by the authority to individual who obtains the benefit of the service. If with a view to provide a specific service, levy is imposed by law and expenses for maintaining the service are met out of the amounts collected there being a reasonable relation between the levy and the expenses incurred for rendering the service, the levy would be in the nature of a fee and not in the nature of a tax. . .. , but a levy will not be regarded as a tax merely because of the absence of uniformity in its incidence, or because compulsion in the collection thereof, nor because some of the contributories do not obtain the same degree of service as others may. In Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. v. State of Oriss(i} the Court bad said: H specific services are rendered to a specific area or to a specific class of persons or trade or business in any local area, and as a condition precedent for the said services or in return ior them cess is levied against the said area or the said · class of persons or trade or business the cess is distinguishable from a tax and is described as a fee. • • • It is true that when the Legislature levies a fee for rendertn$ specific services to a specified area or to a specified class of persons or trade or business, in the last analysis such services may indirectly form part of services to the public in gen.oral. H the special service rendered is distinctly and primarily meant for the benefit of a specified class or area the fact that in benefit- ing the specified class or area the State as a whole may ultimately and indirectly be benefit~ would not detract from the character of the levy as a fee. Where, however, the specific service is indistinguishable from public service, and in essence is directly a part of it, different considerations may arise. In such a ease it is necessary to enquire what is the primary object of the levy 11. 1963 Supp 2 SCR 302: AIR 1963 SC 966 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Its primary object and the essential purpose must be distinguished from its ultimate or incidental results or consequences. That is the true test in determining the character of the levy. Again in H.H. Shri Swamiji v. Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Departmen11a Chandrachud, C.J. said : [SCC para 11, pp. 649-50 : SCC (Tax) pp. 23-24] For the purpose of finding whether there is a correlationship between the services rendered to the fee payers and the fees charged to them, it is necessary to know the cost incurred for organising and rendering the services. But matters involving con- sideration of such a correlationship are not required to be proved by a mathematical formula. What has to be seen is whether there is a fair correspondence between the fee charged and the cost of services rendered to the fee payers as a class. The further and better particulars asked for by the appellants under Order VI, Rule 5 of the Civil Procedure Code, would have driven the Court, had the particulars been supplied, to a laborious and fruitless inquiry into minute details of the Commissioner's depart- mental budget. A vivisection of the amounts spent by the Com- missioner's establishment at different places and for various purposes and the ad hoe allocation by the Court of different amounts to different heads would at best have been speculative. It would have been no more possible for the High Court if the information were before it, than it would be possible for us if the information were before us, to find out what part of the expenses incurred by the Commissioner's establishment at various places and what part of the salary of his staff at those places should be allocated to the functions discharged by the establish- ment in connection with the services rendered to the appellants. We do not therefore think that any substantial prejudice has been caused to the appellants ·by reason of the non-supply of the information sought by them. On a consideration of these cases Sen, J. concluded as follows in Sreenivasa General Traders v. State of Andhra Pradesh2 : (SCC p. 380, para 31) The traditional view that there must be actual quid pro quo for a fee has undergone a sea change in the subsequent decisions. The distinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a ta,: is levied as part of a common burden, while a fee is for payment of a specific benefit or privilege although 12.

Ltd.~rt;~® IONLINEf True Prinf AMAR NATH OM PRAKASH v. STATE OF PUNJAB (Chinnappa Reddy, J.) 361 the special advantage is secondary to the primary motive of regulation in public interest .. . . In determining whether a levy is a fee, the true test must be whether its primary and· essential purpose is to render specific services to a specified area or class ; it may be of no consequence that the State may ultimately and indirectly be benefitted by it . The power of any legislature to levy a fee is conditioned by the fact that it must be .. by and large,, a quid pro quo for the services rendered. However, correlationship between the levy and the services rendered (sic or) expected is one of general character and not of mathematical exactitude. All that is necessary is that there should be a \"reasonable relationship\" between the levy of the fee and the services rendered. Referring to the catena of these cases it was observed by this Court in Municipal Corporation Delhi v. Mohd. Yasin 18 : [SCC para 9, p. 235 : SCC (Tax) p. 160] What do we learn from these precedents ? We learn. that there is no generic difference between a tax and a fee, though broadly a tax is a compulsory exaction as part of a common burden, without promise of any special advantages to -classes of taxpayers whereas a fee is a payment for services rendered, benefit provided or privilege conferred. Compulsion is not the hall- mark of the distinctjon between a tax and a fee. That the money collected does not go into a separate fund but goes into the con- solidated fund does not also necessarily make a levy a tax. Though a fee must have relation to the services rendered, or the advantages conferred, such relation need not be direct, a mere causal relation may be enough. Further, neither the incidence of the fee nor the service rendered need be uniform. That others besides those paying the fees are also benefited does not detract from the character of the fee. In fact the special benefit or advantage to the payers of the fees may even be secondary as compared with the primary motive of regulation in the public interest. Nor is the court to a&-Sume the role of a cost accountant. It is neither necessary nor expedient to weigh too meticulously the co~t of the services rendered etc. against the amount of fees collected so as to evenly balance the two. A broad correlation- ship is all that is necessary. Quid pro quoin the strict sense is not the one and only true index of a fee ; nor is it necessarily absent in a tax. Earlier on a question of interpretation it was pointed out: [SCC para 3, 13.

Vicissitudes of time and neces- situdes of history contribute to changes of philosophical attitudes, concepts, ideas and ideals and, with them, the meanings of words and phrases and the language itself. The philosophy and the language of the law are no exceptions. Words and phrases take colour and character from the context and the times and speak differently in different contexts and times. And, it is worthwhile remembering that words and phrases have not only a meaning but also a content, a living content which breathes, and so, expands and contracts. This is particularly so where the words and phrases properly belong to other disciplines. 'Tax' and 'fee' are such words. They properly belong to the world of Public Finance but since the Constitution and the laws are also con- cerned with Public Finance, these words have often been adju- dicated upon in an effort to discover their content. 9. In Sreenivasa General Traders v. State of Andhra Pradesh 2 • Sen, J. had also pointed out that there was no generic difference between a tax and a fee, that both were compulsory exactions of money by public authorities and that a levy in the nature of a fee did not cease to be of that character merely because there was an element of compulsion or coerciveness present in it nor was it a postulate of a fee that it must have direct relation to the actual service rendered by the authority to each individual, who obtains the benefit of the service. He also drew attention to the increasing realization that the element of quid pro quo in the strict sense was not always sine qua non for fee. Nor was the element of quid pro quo necessarily absent in every tax. He further pointed out that an insistence upon a good and substantial portion of an amount collected on account of fee, say in the neighbourhood of two-thirds or three-fourths, being shown with reasonable certainty as having been spent for rendering services in the market to the payer of fee, could not be a rule of universal applica- tion, and that it was a rule which had necessarily to be confined to the special facts ot Kewa'/ Krishan Puri case'. Otherwise, it would affect the validity of marketing legislations undertaken throughout the country during the past half a century. We agree with the view of Sen, J. that the observations extracted by him from Kewal Krisha11 Puri case 1 were not really necessary for that case and we also agree with the clarification of the observations made by Sen, J. 10. There is one other significant sentence in Sreenivasa General Traders v. State of A .P.:i with which we must express our agreement. It was said: (SCC p. 377, para 27) With utmost respect, these observations of the learned Judge ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

These observations must be read in the context in which they appear. We consider it proper to say, as we have already said in other cases, that judgments of courts are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for Judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the dis- cussion is meant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their words are not to be interpreted as statutes. In London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton11,, Lord MacDermott observed: The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by treating the ipsissima verba of Willes, J ., as though they were part of an Act of Parliament and applying the rules of interpretation appropriate thereto. This is not to detract from the great weight to be given to the language actually used by that most distinguished Judge, ... In Home Office v. Dor5et Yacht Co. Ltd. 1 :-. Lord Reid said: Lorq Atkin's speech 10 •• • is not to be treated as if it was a statutory definition. It will require qualification in new circum- stances. Megarry, J. in (1971) 1 WLR 1062 observed: One must not, of course, construe even a reserv,~d judgment of evc-1. Russell, L.J. as if it were an Act of Parliament. And, in Herrington v. British Railways Board 1', Lord M6rris said: There is always peril in treating the words of a speech or a judgment as though they were words in a legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular case. 11. There are a few other observations in Kewal Krishan Puri case1 to which apply with the same force all that we have said above. It is needless to repeat the oft-quoted truism of Lord Halsbury that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides and not for what may seem to follow logically from it.

Soon after judgment was pronounced in Kewal Krishan Puri case 1, the question arose as to what was to be done with the fee in excess of Rs 2 per 100 collected by various market committees. Were the market committees to be permitted to retain the excess amounts ? Were the excess amounts to be refunded to the traders from whom the amounts had been collected notwithstanding \"the fact that the traders themselves had already passed on the burden to the next purchasers and consumers ? In other words, were the traders to be allowed to get a refund from the market committees and unjustly enrich themselves? Were they to be allowed to profiteer by ill-gotten gains ? Or were the next purchasers or consumers to be traced and the amounts refunded to them, which of course, would well-nigh be an impossible task in practice ? If it was not possible to trace the individual consumers who had borne the burden, was it not right that the public authority who levied and collected it should be allowed to hold and retain the amount as if it were in trust for their benefit to be used for the purposes for which the statute desired the levy of the fee? Some dealers, however, wanted the monies to be refunded to them and moved this Court. Instead, in the circumstances, the Court in Shiv Shanker Dai Mills v. State of Haryana 18 gave the follow- ing directions : (SCC p. 440, para 6) I.

(2) No suit or other proceedings shall be instituted, maintained or continued in any court for the refund of whole or any part of the fee retained by a committee under sub-section ( 1 ) and no court shall enforce any decree or order directing the refund of whole or any part of such fee. ( 3) If anv dispute arises as to the refund of any fee retained bv a Committee by virtue of sub-section ( 1) and the question is whether the burden «of such fee was passed on by the licensee to the next purchaser of the concerned allricultural produce. it shall be presumed unless proved other- wise that such burden was so passed on by the licensee. ( 4) If any amount of fee retainabJe by a committee under sub-section ( 1) has been refunded to anv licensee, t'f1e same shall be recoverable by the committee in the manner it\\dicated in sub-section (2) of Section 41. ( 5) The provisions of this section shall not affect the ooeration of Section 6 of the Puniab Asuicultural Produce Markets (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1976. The primary purpose of Section 23-A is seen on the face of it : it prevents the refund of license fee by the market committee to dealers, who have a1readv Qassed on the burden of such fee to the next pur- chaser of the a~ricultural oroduce and who want to unjustly enrich themselves bv obtaining the refund from the market committee. Section 23-A. in truth, recognises the consumer-public who have borne the ultimate burden as the persons who have •reaJlv paid the amount and so entitled to refund of any excess fee collected and therefore directs the market committee reoresenting their interest\" to retain the amount. It has to be in this form because it would. in Dractice, be a difficult and futile exercise to attempt to trace the individual pur- chasers and consumers who ultimatelv bore the burden.

Instead of allowing middlemen to profiteer by ill-gotten gains, the Legislature has devised a procedure to undo the wrong item that has been done by the excessive levy by allowing the committees to retain the amount to be utilised here- after for the benefit of the very persons for whose benefit the market- ing legjslation was enacted. The constitutional validity of Stction 23-A was questioned before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, but was upheld in Walaiti Ram Mahabir Parshad v. State of Pun;ab 19 • The correctness of this decision is questioned before \\ls in these two ci vii appeals. 14. The submission of the learned counsel was that Section 23-A was a blatant attempt to validate a levy which bad been declared invalid by this Court and this, according to the learned counsel, was not permissible. We entirely disagree with the submission that Section 23-A is an attempt at validating an illegal levy. Section 23-A does not permi't any recovery of fee at the rate of Rs 3 per 100 in respeclt of any sales of agricultural produce before or after the coming into force of that provision. There is no attempt at retrospective valida- tion cf excess collection nor any attempt at providing for future collection at the rate of Rs 3 per 100. All that Section 23-A does is to prevent unjust enrichment by those dealers who have already passed on the burden of the fee to the next purchaser and so reimbursed themselves by also claiming a refund from the market committees. We have already explained the true purpose of Section 23-A. It gives to the public through the market committee what it has taken from the public and is due to it. It renders unto Caesar what is Caesar's. We do :not see any justification for characterising a provision like Section 23-A as one aimed at validating an illegal levy. The decision of this Court in A.V. Nachane v. Union of lndia 20 on which the counsel placed reliance has no application whatsoever. Section 23-A in our view, is· consistent with the spirit of Kewal Krishan 1 and the letter of Shiv Shanker Dai Mi/ls 18 • 1S. Another submis~ion of the learned counsel was that while the Le!!islature was cc-mpetent to enact a law for the levy of a fee and matters incidenta1 and ancillary thereto, it was incompetent to JegisJate providing for the retention bv any authority of fee illegally levied. For this purpose, reliance was placed by the learned counsel on the decision of this Court in R. Abdul Quader & Co. v. Sale~ Tax Officer 21 • We are afraid that this decision also is of no avail to the appellants. 19. AIR 1984 P & H 120 20. (1982) 1 sec 20s: 1982 sec CL&S) S3 21.

Later he applied for refund of tax whfoh was held to be not exigible by this Court in State of Bombay v. United Motors (India) Ltd. 23 When the appeals were pending in this Court, the Orissa Legislature intervened in thei matter and introduced Section 14-A in the principal Act providing that refund could be claimed only by a person from whom the dealer had actually realised the amount as tax. The vires of the provision was challenged in this Court, but it was upheld on the ground that it came within the incidental power arising out of Entry 54 of List II. The matter was considered to be a question of refund and it was held that it could not be doubted that refund of the tax collected was always a matter covered by incidental and ancillary powers relating to the levy and collection of tax. The Constitution Bench held : By Item 54 of List II of Schedule 7 to the Constitution, the State Legislature was indisputably competent to legislate with respect to taxes on sale or purchase of papers and paper-boards. The power to legislate with respect to a tax comprehends the power to impose the tax, to prescribe machinery for collecting the tax, to designate the officers by whom the liability may be enforced and to prescribe the authority, obligations and indem- nity of those officers. The diverse heads of legislation in the Schedule to the Constitution demarcate the periphery of legislative competence and include all matters which are ancillary or sub- sidiary to the primary head. The Legislature of the Orissa State was therefore competent to exercise power in respect of the sub- sidiary or ancillary matter of granting refund of tax improperly or illegally collected, and the competence of the Legislature in this behalf is not canvassed by counsel for the assessees. If com- petence to legislate for granting refund of sales-tax improperly coll~ted be granted. is there anv reason to exclude the power to declare that refund shall be c1aimab1e only by the person from whom the dealer has actua11y realised the amounts by way of sates-tax or otherwise? We see none. The question is one of 1egis1ative competence and there is no restriction either express or implied imposed upon the power of the Legislature in that behalf. 17. The present case is a case akin to Orient Paper Mills case22 • Section 23-A, as we have seen. disables a dealer from getting a refund of fee paid by him, the burden of whiah he has already passed on to the next purchaser. As we said a11 that Section 23-A does is 22.

STATE OF PUNJAB (Ch[nnappa Reddy, J.) 369 to prevent unjust enrichment by means of a refund to which the person claiming it has no moral or equitable entitlement. 18. R. Abdul Quader & Co. v. Sales Tax Ofjicer 1 on which considerable reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the appellants was an entirely different case. The dealer in that case had collected sales tax from the purchasers in connection with the sales made by him on the basis that the incidence of the tax lay on the sellers and assured the purchaser that after paying the tax to the appelJant. there would be no further liability on them. After realising the tax, however. the appellant did not pay the amount realised to the Government, but kept it in a suspense account. When the Sales Tax Department discovered this and called uoon the appellant to pay the amount realised, he refused to do so. On behalf of the Govern- ment, reliance was place<l upon Section 11 (2) of the Hyderabad General Sales Tax Act which laid down that any amount collected by way of tax otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act shall be paid over to the Government and in default of such oavment. the said amount shall be recovered from such person as if it were arrears of land revenue. The Court held that it was clear that the words \"otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Act\". included amounts which mav have been collected by way of tax though not exiejhle as tax nnder the Act. The Court then held that the State Lee:islature was incomoetent to enact a provision like Section 11 (2) as it enabled the Government to recover an illegal levy and it could not possiblv be ~airl to be an incidental or ancillary power capable of exercise in airl of the main topic of }ej?islation. which was, a tax on the saJP. -or purchase of Poods. The decision in Or;ent PoTJer Mm.v Ltd. rase22 was distinguished on the ~nd that it dealt with a case of refund anif not the collection of tax. not really due as a tax under the law. In their precise words, they said : The matter <in Orient Par,er Mills Ltd. C(Ue2 2 ) dealt with a question of rPfund and it cannot be doubted that refund of the tax collected is alwavs a matter covered bv in~idental and ancilJarv powers relatinsz to the levv and collection of tax.
