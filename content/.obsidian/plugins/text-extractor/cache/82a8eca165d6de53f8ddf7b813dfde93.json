(l) The rule of equality in public employment. a (m) The 'essence' of other fundamental rights in Part III. (n) The concept of social and economic justice-to build a welfare State; Part IV in toto. (o) The balance between fundamental rights and directive principles. (p) The parliamentary system of government. b (q) The principle of free and fair elections. (r) Limitations upon the amending power conferred by Article 368. (s) Independence of the judiciary; but within the four corners of the Constitution and not beyond that. (t) Independent and efficient judicial system. C (u) Powers of the Supreme Court under Articles 32, 136, 141 and 142. (v) Effective access to justice.\" (See pp. 2236-38.) Of these features \"free and fair election\" in clause (r) [sic clause (q)] comes closest to the question discussed in this case. 27. This Court has already held relying on the Constitution Bench d judgment in Poudyal2 that ensuring uniformity in the value of votes is not a constitutionally mandated imperative of free and fair election under our constitutional dispensation. Therefore, the argument on the que stion of basic structure is also without substance and is rejected. 28. For the reasons aforesaid, this Court does not find any merit in the appeal and which is accordingly dismissed. The parties are left to bear their e own costs.

CIT, (2009) 2 SCC 90, impliedly relied on For applicability of the doctrine of substantial compliance a mere attempted compliance may not be sufficient, but actual compliance with those factors which are considered as essential is required. The doctrine of substantial compliance is a judicial invention, equitable in nature, designed to avoid hardship in cases where a party does all that can reasonably be expected of it, but failed or faulted in some minor or inconsequential aspects which cannot be described as the \"essence\" or the \"substance\" of the requirements. Like the concept of \"reasonableness\", the acceptance or otherwise of a plea of \"substantial compliance\" depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the purpose and object to be achieved and the context of the prerequisites which are essential to achieve the object and purpose of the rule or the regulation. (Paras 34 and 32) If mandatory requirements are complied with, it will be proper to say that the enactment has been substantially complied with notwithstanding the non-compliance of directory requirements or mere technical provisions. The doctrine of substantial compliance seeks to preserve the need to comply strictly with the conditions or requirements that are important to invoke a tax or duty exemption and to forgive non-compliance for either unimportant and tangential requirements or requirements that are so confusingly or incorrectly written that an earnest effort at compliance should be accepted. (Paras 33 and 31) The mandatory requirements must be obeyed or fulfilled exactly. However, a condition may be given a liberal meaning if the same is directory in nature. (Paras 29 and 31) TISC0 Ltd. V. State of Jharkhand, (2005) 4 sec 272, relied on The defence of the doctrine of substantial compliance cannot be pleaded if a clear statutory prerequisite which effectuates the object and the purpose of the statute has not been met. The doctrine of substantial compliance means that the Court should determine whether the statute, rule or regulation has been followed sufficiently so as to carry out the intent of the statute and accomplish the reasonable objectives for which it was passed and not a mirror image type of strict compliance.

Synthetics2 on the ground of \"intended use\" and the principle of \"substantial compliance\". a 3. The matter came up before the three-Judge Bench of this Court which doubted the correctness and the applicability of the abovementioned judgments and took the view that the exemption notification called for strict interpretation so far as the eligibility is concerned especially when an assessee seeks exemption of duty under a notification issued by the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section b 5-A of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 read with sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act, 1957 which called for compliance with the procedure set out in Chapter X of the Central Excise Rules, 1944. Further, it was also observed that in Thermax (P) Ltd. 1 and J.K. Synthetics2 , this Court dealt with a situation where goods were imported from outside the country, unlike the present case c where specified intermediate goods were locally manufactured, in some other units of the respondents. The Court ordered that the matter required reconsideration and referred the matter to a larger Bench. The order of reference is reported in CCE v. Hari Chand Shri Gopal3. 4.

Consequently, on 25-3-1997, notices were issued to the respondents and their partners to show cause why the amounts of duty involved should not be demanded from them jointly and severally under Rule 9(2) of the Excise Rules read with the proviso to Section 11-A(l) of the Tariff Act and interest thereon under Section 11-AB of the Tariff Act, be not demanded from them. Penalty under Rule 173-Q of the Excise Rules read with Section 11-AC of the Tariff Act and Rule 209-A of the Excise Rules was also demanded.

Aggrieved by the abovementioned orders, appeals were preferred before the Tribunal and the Tribunal vide order dated 1-10-1999 concurred with the findings of the Adjudicating Commissioner on duty liability on the goods in question and also on the issue of limitation as well as the claim for proforma credit/MODVAT credit, but ordered re-examination of the limited question of the applicability of Notification No. 121/94-CE dated 11-8-1994 since the respondents had raised the contention that they had substantially complied with the procedures laid down in Chapter X . 11. The matter was then reconsidered by the Commissioner as directed by the Tribunal. The respondents contended before the Commissioner that they had despatched the goods to their final manufacturing units though transfer challans and the receipts were recorded in Form-IV register/stock register and the utilisation of the goods was recorded in RG-12 register. Further, it was also stated that the final products manufactured by the respondents could be ascertained from RG-1 register maintained at the recipient end and those records would be sufficient to establish the use of the goods and establish the plea of substantial compliance with the procedure set out in Chapter X for duty exemption. 12. The Commissioner rejected all the contentions vide his order dated 16-7-2002 and held that the benefit of the exemption notification would be available only if the procedures laid down in Chapter X were complied with and that the records produced by the respondents would not substantiate a plea of substantial compliance with the procedure laid down in the abovementioned chapter. The imposition of the duty liability, interest and penalty was therefore confirmed. 13. The respondents, carried the matter in appeal before the Tribunal. The Tribunal, we have already indicated, placed reliance on the judgments of this Court in Thermax (P) Ltd. 1 and J.K. Synthetics2 and took the view that the benefit of the exemption notification should not be denied if \"intended use\" of the goods was established, though there was non-compliance of the procedural conditions of Chapter X.

The learned Senior Counsel submitted that the Tribunals and some of the High Courts are following the above principle, uniformly applying the principles laid down in Thermax ( P) Ltd. I and J.K. Synthetics2 • 18. We may, before examining various contentions raised by the respective parties, point out that the respondents had earlier approached this Court by filing CAs Nos. 5747-49 of 2000, challenging the order of the Tribunal stating that kimam was excisable and that the Department was right in invoking the extended period of limitation under the proviso to Section 11-A(l) of the Excise Act. This Court partly allowed the appeals holding that the Department was not entitled to invoke the extended period of limitation under the proviso to Section 11-A(l) of the Excise Act, but held that the addictive mixture kimam was excisable and classifiable under Sub-Headings 2404.49/2404.40. This Court also recorded a finding that although there was contravention of the provisions of Section 6 read with Rule 17 4 and that they had not observed regulations in the units at Delhi for the manufacture of excisable goods, there was no intent to evade payment of duty. The judgment is reported in Gopal Zarda Udyog v. CCEI 9 . 19. In this case, we are only concerned with the question whether the respondents are entitled to get the benefit of the Exemption Notification dated 11-8-1994 on the ground of \"intended use\" and \"substantial compliance\" with the procedure set out in Chapter X of the Excise Rules. C d e 20.

The compliance with the provisions of Chapter X is a precondition for claiming exemption from payment of excise duty on goods, which otherwise attract duty. Show-cause notices were issued to the respondents since they had manufactured the excisable goods (at the supplier end) without obtaining registration under Section 6 read with Rule 174 by contravening the provisions of Rules 9(1), 52-A, 53, 54, 173-B, 173-C, 173-F and 226 of the Rules for which duty liability, interest thereon and penalty were imposed. Even assuming that the respondents were eligible for exemption from duty, the respondents could not be absolved from the legal obligation to comply with the statutory requirements for the manufacture of excisable goods at the supplier end. 23. The purpose and object of the Notification dated 11-8-1994 was to exempt those specified intermediate goods, which were otherwise excisable to duty, and not to exempt or absolve the respondents from following the statutory requirements for the manufacture of intermediate excisable goods. The notification under Chapter X was designed in such a manner to ensure an inseparable link between the supplier and recipient of excisable goods for the manufacture of specified final products. Rule 192 of Chapter X states that a manufacturer intending to receive duty-free goods under remission is required to make an application in Form R-1 for obtaining excisable goods to be used for special industrial purpose giving details of the estimated quantity of each class or variety of goods and the value of such goods likely to be used during the year, commodities to be manufactured and estimated output and clearance of each commodity during the year, manner of manufacture, purpose for which manufactured product is supplied and the source from which excisable goods will be obtained. 24. Based on the details furnished in Form R-1, the registering authority has to consider granting permission for remission of duty. For the said purpose, R-2 certificate is required to be issued specifying that the registration certificate is meant for obtaining the excisable goods under Rule 192. On the basis of R-2 certificate, the manufacturer become eligible for getting the excisable goods for which the remission of duty has been sought.

On such request and after complying with all the statutory formalities, the jurisdictional officer is required to issue C-2 certificate and, on the strength of that certificate, the applicant can obtain duty-free goods. a The jurisdictional officer has also to certify that the said manufacturer is registered in their range under Rule 192 and is authorised for obtaining excisable goods at nil/concessional rate of duty for use in special industrial purpose for the manufacture of specified excisable goods at their factory. Further, on the strength of C-2 certificate, the excisable goods can be removed from the factory of source manufacturer without payment of duty or b concessional rate of duty, as the case may be. 25. Further, as per sub-rule (1) of Rule 194, the applicant is required to maintain proper records of such goods indicating quantity, value, rate and amount of duty, marks and number/wastage, etc. in Form RG-16 register. Further, the applicant is also required to file quarterly return in the form of RT-11 and in that return, the registered person had to make entries regarding c details of receipt of goods, quantities issued for manufacturing, wastage or other losses, description of process in which excisable goods are to be used, etc. The supplier of goods is required to be registered with Central Excise under Rule 174 and is also required to mention in Column lO(i) or lO(ii) of RT-12 returns the details of goods despatched to the assessee availing facility under Chapter X. The supplier of goods can remove the goods only under d proper gate pass GP-1 and is required to mention the details of CT-2 on the gate pass. 26. Rule 196 provides for payment of duty by the recipient if the goods obtained under Rule 192 are not accounted for or used in the manner prescribed under these rules. Similarly, Rule 196-A stipulates that surplus goods so received under Rule 192 can be cleared on payment of duty. Rule e 196-AA provides for transfer of such goods received under Rule 192 to another manufacturer who has been granted registration under Rule 192 with the prior approval of the proper officer. Rule 196-B provides for the manner in which goods received under Rule 192 may be disposed of if found defective or damaged, they can be returned to the original manufacturer and such returned goods shall be added to the original manufacturer and such returned goods f shall be added to the non-duty paid stock of the original manufacturer. 27. Finally, Rule 196-BB provides for movement of goods received under Rule 192 as such, or after partial processing outside the factory for repair and return. The applicant, though registered under Rule 17 4, can receive the remitted goods for use in special industrial purpose only if it gets an endorsement to that effect on the registration certificate, so given in Form g R-2, in advance which in this case was obtained only on 22-10-1996, after the event.

CT-2 certificate is required to be shown to the supplier unit who shall mention the CT-2 number on the gate pass before delivering the goods without payment of duty on the strength of CT-2 certificate. Compliance with the abovementioned requirements, stipulated in Chapter X, is a prerequisite for getting exemption from the remission of excise duty on the specified goods. Exemption clause - Strict construction 29. The law is well settled that a person who claims exemption or concession has to establish that he is entitled to that exemption or concession. A provision providing for an exemption, concession or exception, as the case may be, has to be construed strictly with certain exceptions depending upon the settings on which the provision has been placed in the statute and the object and purpose to be achieved. If exemption is available on complying with certain conditions, the conditions have to be complied with. The mandatory requirements of those conditions must be obeyed or fulfilled exactly, though at times, some latitude can be shown, if there is a failure to comply with some requirements which are directory in nature, the non- compliance of which would not affect the essence or substance of the notification granting exemption. 30. In Novopan India Ltd. 4 this Court held that a person, invoking an exception or exemption provisions, to relieve him of tax liability must establish clearly that he is covered by the said provisions and, in case of doubt or ambiguity, the benefit of it must go to the State. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Hansraj Gordhandas v. CCE and Customs20 held that (Novopan India Ltd. case4 , SCC p. 614, para 16) \"16 . ... such a notification has to be interpreted in the light of the words employed by it and not on any other basis. This was so held in the context of the principle that in a taxing statute, there is no room for any intendment, that regard must b e had to the clear m eaning of the words and that the matter should be governed wholly by the language of the notification i.e. by the plain terms of the exemption.\" 31. Of course, some of the provisions of an exemption notification may be directory in nature and some are mandatory in nature. A distinction between the provisions of a statute which are of substantive character and were built in with certain specific objectives of policy, on the one hand, and those which are merely procedural and technical in their nature, on the other, must be kept clearly distinguished. In T!sco Ltd. 11 this Court held that the principles as regard construction of an exemption notification are no longer res integra; whereas the eligibility clause in relation to an exemption notification is given strict meaning wherefor the notification has to be interpreted in terms of its language, once an assessee satisfies the eligibility clause, the exemption clause therein may be construed literally.

Doctrine of substantial compliance and \"intended use\" 32. The doctrine of substantial compliance is a judicial invention, equitable in nature, designed to avoid hardship in cases where a party does all that can reasonably be expected of it, but failed or faulted in some minor or inconsequent aspects which cannot be described as the \"essence\" or the \"substance\" of the requirements. Like the concept of \"reasonableness\", the acceptance or otherwise of a plea of \"substantial compliance\" depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the purpose and object to be achieved and the context of the prerequisites which are essential to achieve the object and purpose of the rule or the regulation. Such a defence cannot be pleaded if a clear statutory prerequisite which effectuates the object and the purpose of the statute has not been met. Certainly, it means that the Court should determine whether the statute has been followed sufficiently so as to carry out the intent for which the statute was enacted and not a mirror image type of strict compliance. Substantial compliance means \"actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute\" and the Court should determine whether the statute has been followed sufficiently so as to carry out the intent of the statute and accomplish the reasonable objectives for which it was passed. 33. A fiscal statute generally seeks to preserve the need to comply strictly with regulatory requirements that are important, especially when a party seeks the benefits of an exemption clause that are important. Substantial compliance with an enactment is insisted, where mandatory and directory requirements are lumped together, for in such a case, if mandatory requirements are complied with, it will be proper to say that the enactment has been substantially complied with notwithstanding the non-compliance of directory requirements. In cases where substantial compliance has been found, there has been actual compliance with the statute, albeit procedurally faulty. The doctrine of substantial compliance seeks to preserve the need to comply strictly with the conditions or requirements that are important to invoke a tax or duty exemption and to forgive non-compliance for either unimportant and tangential requirements or requirements that are so confusingly or incorrectly written that an earnest effort at compliance should be accepted. 34. The test for determining the applicability of the substantial compliance doctrine has been the subject of a myriad of cases and quite often, the critical question to be examined is whether the requirements relate to the \"substance\" or \"essence\" of the statute, if so, strict adherence to those requirements is a precondition to give effect to that doctrine. On the other hand, if the requirements are procedural or directory in that they are not of the \"essence\" of the thing to be done but are given with a view to the orderly conduct of business, they may be fulfilled by substantial, if not strict compliance. In other words, a mere attempted compliance may not be sufficient, but actual compliance with those factors which are considered as essential. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The details to be furnished in Form No. 1 as per Rule 192 and the declaration to be made, relate to the \"substance\" and \"essence\" of Chapter X. R-2 registration certificate is also prerequisite to obtain CT-2 certificate. Further, the execution of bonds as provided in that chapter is also not an empty formality for obtaining the duty-free excisable goods. Bonds also insist for a declaration. CT-2 certificate will be issued only if a party gets registered under Form R-2 from the registering authority. Only if CT-2 certificate is obtained, the excisable goods could be removed. Form RG-16 register and the details to be furnished in Form RT-11 are also statutory in nature, which relate to the \"substance\" and \"essence\" of the requirements under Chapter X. Undisputedly, those requirements had not been complied with. 36. The respondents have laid great emphasis on maintenance of some statutory registers and filing of periodical returns at the recipient unit, so as to take the shelter under the doctrine of substantial compliance for remission of duty. The respondents pointed out that they had identical columns in the registers kept at the recipient end, hence, the requirement of maintaining separate register at the supplier end and the requirements of Chapter X was substantially complied with. It may be noted that RG-16 register prescribed was specific to Chapter X with the sole intention of maintaining separate accounts for receipt, issue and usage of duty-free remitted inputs received from the supplier unit. Similarity of columns and the details furnished therein cannot be considered as a substitute for not maintaining of RG-16 register or other registers for remission of duty under Chapter X. 37. We have already indicated that, at the supplier end, no registration under Rule 17 4 was obtained and no records were kept. The applicants, at the recipient end, were also legally obliged to give various declarations in the statutory forms so as to claim exemption and such declarations admittedly were not made. Non-compliance of those conditions enumerated under various rules in Chapter X of the Excise Rules and non-furnishing of various statutory forms prescribed under Chapter X, in our view, are fatal to a plea of substantial compliance and intended use. The respondents, therefore, on the facts of this case, have not succeeded in establishing the plea of \"intended use\" or \"the substantial compliance\" with the procedure set out in Chapter X so as to claim the benefit of Exemption Notification dated 11-8-1994. 38. We will now examine whether the judgments in Thermax ( P) Ltd. 1 and J.K. Synthetics2 require reconsideration. In Thermax (P) Ltd. 1 the assessee had cleared imported goods after paying the custom duty as well as the additional duty (CVD). Later, it was felt that it should have claimed the concession in respect of CVD on the strength of Notifications Nos. 63/85 and 93/76 issued under Section 8 of the Tariff Act. Therefore, an application for refund of CVD was submitted which was rejected by the Assistant Collector, but was allowed by the Collector in appeal. On appeal, the Tribunal took the view that the assessee had failed to satisfy the conditions laid down in Chapter X. On appeal by the assessee, this Court took the view that the Tribunal was in error in holding that the assessee could not get refund 1 Thermax (P) Ltd. v.

This Court mainly relied on the letter of the Board dated 27-7-1987 wherein it was stated that whenever intended use of material could be established by the importer, the benefit of exemption notification should not be denied on the imported goods only because the procedural condition falling under Chapter X was not complied with. It is under such circumstances that this Court allowed the claim of the assessee and ordered refund. 39. Reasoning of this Court in Thermax ( P) Ltd. I is inapplicable to the facts of the present case. In the instant case, we are not concerned with the goods imported from outside the country. Both the suppliers of specified intermediate goods as well as manufactures of specified final products are situated in India and are obliged to follow various statutory provisions, not only for the manufacture of excisable goods, but also for claiming exemption under the Notification dated 11-8-1994. Consequently, the plea of intended use of the materials cannot be applied to the facts of the present case. 40. In J.K. Synthetics2 the assessee was the manufacturer of polyester chips, staple fibre and tow from mono-ethylene glycol (MEG). On importing those goods, they claimed exemption from payment of additional duty of customs thereon because MEG was exempted from the payment of excise duty by virtue of Notification dated 4-5-1987 issued under Section 8 of the Tariff Act. In that case, the contention was raised by the Revenue that the assessee had not followed the conditions laid down in Chapter X of the Excise Rules. But the Tribunal, on facts, found that there had been substantial compliance with the procedure by the assessee, which was approved by this Court without laying down any principle as such which cannot be applied to the facts of the present case. 41. Consequently, the decisions of this Court in Thennax (P) Ltd.I and J.K. Synthetics2 cannot be applied in all facts situation and it is declared that the findings recorded in those decisions would be confined to the facts of those cases. Civil Appeal No. 1631 of 2001 42. Civil Appeal No. 1631 of 2001 arises out of the order dated 1-12-2000 passed by the Tribunal at New Delhi. The issue involved in that case is whether the exemption from the payment of central excise duty was available to the populated printed circuit board (PCB), manufactured and cleared by the assessee under Notification No. 48/94-CE dated 1-3-1994. The Tribunal found that the assessee was not eligible for the benefit of the notification since the assessee had not followed the procedure set out in Chapter X of the Excise Rules by clearing PCB from their unit to the central store at A-11, Okhla Industrial Area, Phase 1, New Delhi. The Tribunal held that, under Chapter X, the assessee who wanted to avail of the benefit of exemption notification had to file application in Form AL-6 to the jurisdictional Central excise authorities and had to obtain L-6 licence and had l Thermax ( P) Ltd. v.

On facts as well as on law, we fully endorse the view taken by the Tribunal and the appeal would stand dismissed. Civil Appeals Nos. 568-69 of 2009 43. These appeals have been pref erred by the Revenue against the order dated 6-5-2008 passed by the Tribunal at New Delhi, holding that the assesses are entitled to the benefit of Notifications Nos. 3/2001-CE and 6/2001-CE, irrespective of the fact that the procedures under Chapter X were followed or not. The Tribunal expressed the view that the procedure laid down in Chapter X is meant to be followed only to establish the receipt of goods by the recipient unit and their utilisation. 44. The assessee in these appeals were engaged in the manufacture of pump parts and gunmetal casting falling under Chapter 84 and Chapter 73 respectively of the First Schedule to the Tariff Act and claimed the benefit of abovementioned notifications. The officers of the Central Excise Department carried out a search at the factory premises of the assessee on 25-8-2004. On the basis of that search, the Commissioner took the view that the assessee had contravened the procedure of the exemption notification and removed the excisable goods clandestinely. A notice was issued to show cause why the central excise duty and the penalty therein be not imposed on the assessee. 45. The Commissioner, Central Excise, Ahmedabad vide order dated 31-5-2007 demanded central excise duty of <15,14,966 from M/s Neatwell Castings under proviso to Section 11-A of the Central Excise Act, 1944 by invoking extended period of five years along with the penalty thereon. In appeal filed by the assessee before the Commissioner (Appeals), it was held that the benefit of the notification could not be denied only on the ground that the procedure laid down in Chapter X had not been followed. The decision of the Commissioner (Appeals) was upheld by the Tribunal in appeal. 46. We find it difficult to sustain the reasoning of the Tribunal that the procedure laid down in Chapter X, is meant only to establish the receipt of goods by the recipient unit and their utilisation. The Tribunal completely overlooked the object and purpose of the procedure laid down in Chapter X. The goods manufactured at the supplier end were excisable goods and if a party wants remission of duty, it has to follow certain prerequisites, the object of which is to see that the goods be not diverted or utilised for some other purpose, in the guise of the exemption notification. Detailed procedures have been laid down in Chapter X so as to curb the diversion and misutilisation of goods which are otherwise excisable. The plea of \"substantial compliance\" and \"intended use\" is, therefore, rejected for the reasons already stated. 47. Consequently, Civil Appeals Nos. 1878-80 of 2004 and Civil Appeals Nos. 568-69 of 2009 preferred by the Revenue would stand allowed and Civil Appeal No. 1631 of 2001 shall stand dismissed.
