KAPADIA, C.J.- These curative petitions are filed by Central Bureau of Investigation for recalling the judgment and order dated 13-9-1996 of this Court in Keshub Mahindra v. State of M.P. 1 on the following premises: (i) When this Court, by the saidjudgment dated 13-9-1996 1 quashed the charges framed against Accused 2 to 5, 7 to 9 and 12 under Sections 304 (Part II), 324, 326 and 429 IPC and directed the trial court to frame charges under Section 304-A IPC, this Court had before it adequate material to make out prima facie, an offence chargeable under Section 304 (Part II) IPC. Therefore, this Court committed a serious error in ignoring such material and quashing the charge under Section 304 (Part II) IPC. (ii) The evidence placed in support of the charge under Section 304-A IPC during the trial of the said accused before the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bhopal showed prima facie that the said accused had committed offences punishable under Section 304 (Part II) IPC. But for the said judgment of this Court dated 13-9-1996 1, the learned Magistrate would have, by taking note of the said material, committed the case to the Court of Session under Section 323 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short \"the Code\"). However, in view of the categorical finding recorded by this Court, in its binding judgment dated 13-9-1996 1 that there was no material for a charge under Section 304 (Part II) IPC and consequential quashing of the said charge, with a direction to frame the charge under Section 304-A IPC, the learned Magistrate was barred from exercising his judicial power under Section 323 of the Code, even 1 (1996) 6 sec 129 : 1996 sec (Cri) 1124 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On the night of 2-12-1984 there was a massive escape of lethal gas from the MIC storage tank at Bhopal plant of the Union Carbide India Ltd. (\"UCIL\") into the atmosphere causing the death of 5295 people leaving b 5,68,292 people suffering from different kinds of injuries ranging from permanent total disablement to less serious injuries. On the day following the incident, SHO, Hanuman Ganj Police Station, suo motu, registered Crime Case No. 1104 of 1984 under Section 304-A IPC. 3. On 6-12-1984 the investigation was handed over to CBI, which investigation stood completed, resulting in filing of charge-sheets by CBI in c the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bhopal on 1-12-1987. Since the charge-sheets inter alia alleged commission of offences under Sections 304, 324, 326, 429 read with Section 35 IPC, the case was committed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate to the Sessions Court as Sessions Case No. 237 of 1992 (see order dated 30-4-1992). 4. On 8-4-1993, the ninth Additional Sessions Judge, Bhopal passed an order framing charges against Accused 5 to 9 under Sections 304 (Part II), 324, 326 and 429 IPC and against Accused 2, 3, 4 and 12 under the very same sections but with the aid of Section 35 IPC. It may be mentioned that at the time of framing of charges, the court had before it, Accused 2 to 9 and Accused 12 (UCIL) whereas Accused 1 (Warren Anderson) was absconding and the court was also unable to bring before it the other two companies, Union Carbide Corporation and Union Carbide Eastern Inc., Accused 10 and 11. d e 5. The accused after having unsuccessfully challenged the order framing charges by the Court of Session before the Madhya Pradesh High Court, brought the matter to this Court in four separate appeals in which the leading case was Appeal (Cri.) No. 1672 of 1996 filed at the instance of Accused 2 which stood ultimately disposed of by the judgment of the Division Bench of f this Court dated 13-9-1996 in Keshub Mahindra 1. This Court held that on the material produced by the prosecution before the trial court at the stage of framing of charges, no charges could have been framed against the accused under Section 304 (Part II) or under Sections 324, 326, 429 with or without the aid of Section 35 IPC and it accordingly quashed the charges framed by the Sessions Court and directed that on the material led by the prosecution the charge under Section 304-A IPC could be made out against Accused 5, 6, g 7, 8 and 9 and under the same sections with the aid of Section 35 against Accused 2, 3, 4 and 12. 6. Applications seeking leave to file a review petition being Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions Nos. 1713-16 of 1997 in a proposed review petition stood dismissed on 10-3-1997.

CBI/State of Madhya Pradesh did not question the said 1996 judgment nor filed any review petition under Article 137 of the Constitution and instead proceeded for the next 14 years to prosecute the accused under Sections 304-A, 336, 337, 338 read with Section 35 IPC. 7. It is only on 26-4-2010, after the defence evidence stood concluded and after conclusion of the oral arguments by the Senior Public Prosecutor, that, a petition was filed jointly by BGPSSS and BGPMUS under Section 216 CrPC for enhancement of the charge to Section 304 (Part II) IPC. This application was not supported by CBI. The said application was rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate on the same day. However, this order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate was also never challenged under Sections 397 /399 or under Section 482 CrPC . Ultimately on 7-6-2010 Criminal Case No. 1104 of 1984 stood disposed of by the Chief Judicial Magistrate vide his judgment convicting Accused 2 to 5, 7 to 9 and 12 under Sections 304-A, 336, 337, 338 read with Section 35 IPC and sentencing them to two years' imprisonment. 8. On 29-6-2010 Criminal Appeal No. 369 of 2010 was filed by the State of Madhya Pradesh before the Court of Session with a prayer for enhancement of sentences under the existing charges. On the same day the State of Madhya Pradesh also filed Criminal Revision Application No. 330 of 2010 before the Court of Session under Section 397 CrPC, challenging the alleged failure of the Chief Judicial Magistrate to enhance the charges to Section 304 (Part II) in exercise of his jurisdiction under Section 216 CrPC, and to commit the trial of the case to Sessions Court under Section 323 CrPC and inter alia praying for a direction to enhance charges and commit. 9. On 29-7-2010 Criminal Appeal No. 487 of 2010 was filed by CBI before the Court of Session for enhancement of sentences under the existing charges. On 23-8-2010, CBI filed the criminal revision only after the present curative petitions were filed before this Court on 2-8-2010. All the appeals and revisions remain pending before the Court of Session. 10. It is clear to us that in the criminal revisions filed by CBI and the State of Madhya Pradesh the legal position is correctly stated. But the curative petitions are based on a plea that is wrong and fallacious. As noted above, one of the main planks of the curative petitions is that even though in the course of the trial before the Magistrate, additional evidences have come on record that fully warrant the framing of the higher charge(s) and the trial of the accused on those higher charges, as long as the 1996 judgment stands the Sessions Court would feel helpless in framing any higher charges against the accused in the same way as the trial court observed that in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court no court had the power to try the accused for an offence higher than the one under Section 304-A IPC. The assumption is wrong and without any basis . It stems from a complete misapprehension in regard to the binding nature of the 1996 judgment. 11. No decision by any court, this Court not excluded, can be read in a manner as to nullify the express provisions of an Act or the Code and the 1996 judgment never intended to do so. In the 1996 judgment, this Court was at pains to make it absolutely clear that its findings were based on materials gathered in the investigation and brought before the Court till that stage.

The 1996 judgrnent was rendered at the stage of Sections 209/228/240 of the Code and we are completely unable to see how the judgrnent can be read to say that it removed from. the Code Sections 323, 216, 386, 397, 399, 401, etc. or denuded a competent court of the powers under those provisions. In our view, on the basis of the material b on record, it is wrong to assume that the 1996 judgment is a fetter against the proper exercise of powers by a court of competent jurisdiction under the relevant provisions of the Code. 12. If according to the curative petitioner, the learned Magistrate failed to appreciate the correct legal position and misread the decision dated 13-9-1996 1 as tying his hands from. exercising the power under Section 323 c or under Section 216 of the Code, it can certainly be corrected by the appellate/Revisional Court. In fact, the revision petitions though belatedly filed by the State of Madhya Pradesh and CBI (which are still pending) have asserted this position in the grounds of revision. Moreover, no ground falling within the parameters of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra 2 is rnade out in the curative petitions. Also, no satisfactory explanation is given to file such d curative petitions after about 14 years from the 1996 judgrnent of the Supreme Court. The curative petitions are therefore dismissed. 13.
