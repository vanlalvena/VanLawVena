The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VIVIAN BOSE, J.- This is an unfortunate case in which a man who wanted and intended to make a gift of certain shares to his son-in-law procrastinated until too late. He died without completing the necessary formalities. The consequence is that the properties now pass to the legal heirs. 2. The son-in-law is the first defendant Sachindra Nath Sett.

Haralal purchased a number of shares from time to time. The scrips all stood in his name and were deposited in the Calcutta Branch of Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China. 4. In July 1938, Haralal got his daughter (illegitimate) married to the appellant. He withdrew some of his shares from the Bank and sold them in order to meet the marriage expenses. The appellant thereafter lived with his father-in-law as a gharjamai. 5. In August 1938, Haralal fell seriously ill but recovered and thereafter he seems to have directed his attention to the settlement of his affairs. It seems that Haralal's brother, Keshub, had deposited a sum ofRs 14,500 with Haralal and it is possible that some of the shares were purchased with the help of this money. Anyway, a dispute arose, but it was settled amicably in December 1938. 6. Haralal withdrew 400 shares from the Bank and transferred them to Keshub. Keshub accepted them in discharge of Rs 14,000 of his claim and on 24th of December executed a document Ext. A-1 stating that he had no claims on his brother's property. The Rs 500 then outstanding was repaid on 25-3-1939 and Keshub passed a receipt Ext. Y in full satisfaction. 7. Shortly before this, on 15-1-1939, Haralal gifted the house in which they were all residing to his mistress. That disposed of all the property except the shares now in dispute. It will be noticed that the only person for whom he had not yet provided was his daughter. 8. It seems that sometime before his death Haralal signed eleven share transfer deeds. The appellant claims under them and the only question we need to decide is whether this transaction was ever completed. The documents were hotly contested as forgeries and the claim was also resisted on other grounds, but for the purposes of this appeal we can accept the finding of the High Court (differing from that of the first court) that the signatures were genuine. The deeds are dated 13-1-1939. The appellant admits that no stamps had been affixed at that time and also that the share scrips remained with the Bank till February 1939. b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On 7-2-1939 or 8-2-1939 Haralal withdrew the share scrips now in dispute from the Bank and, according to the appellant, Haralal annexed the different transfer deeds to the corresponding scrips and handed them over to the appellant. This is disputed. 10. Haralal died on 13-5-1939 and shortly after, namely, on 24-5-1939, the appellant presented the share scrips and transfer deeds to the relevant companies for registration of his name. The registration was effected on various dates between 25-5-1939 and 5-6-1939. Shortly after, sometime in June or July, Keshub attempted to get his name registered but failed as the registration had already been effected. 11. In the meanwhile (sometime in May 1939) Keshub started proceeding under Section 192 of the Succession Act in the Court of the District Judge (Misc. Case No. 67 of 1939), Hooghly. The District Judge held that the shares were in the possession of the first four defendants in this case and refused to decide the question of title but issued a temporary injunction against the defendants and directed Keshub to bring a civil suit within a month. That occasioned the present suit. Keshub was the original plaintiff and after him his nephews N aba Kumar and Lal Behary were substituted and later Tulsidas was also added. 12. The appellant's story regarding the execution of the transfer deeds is as follows. He says that Haralal called him at about 8.30 in the morning of 13-1-1939. He had before him a number of printed forms for the transfer of shares with the usual blanks. Haralal filled in two of the several blanks in each form in his (the appellant's) presence. The blanks related to the number of shares to which the form related [e.g. \"one hundred\" in Ext. 11(1), \"fifty\" in Ext. 11 (b )(1) and so on] and to the serial numbers of the shares. After he had done this, he handed the forms over to the appellant and told him to fill in certain other blanks e.g. the appellant's name as buyer and his address, the name of the company [\"Midnapore Zamindary Co. Ltd.\" in Ext. 1 l(b)(l)] and the date, \"the 13th of January, 1939\". The appellant admitted that the words describing the amount of the consideration were also filled in by him (the appellant) but he said he could not remember whether that was done then or later. After he had done that much, the appellant went away. 13. While the appellant was away, Haralal is said to have filled in the names of the respective companies on the top of the forms and his own name as transferor and then to have signed them. Two attesting witnesses are also said to have signed. The appellant returned that night and saw that all the remaining blanks had been filled in as above and that Haralal and the witnesses had signed. Haralal then asked the appellant to sign as buyer and he did so. But no stamps were affixed even then and the appellant says he does not know who purchased them or who affixed them. 14. Now the question of these stamps is important. The appellant's story is that the forms were handed over to him that night after he signed them. They therefore remained in his custody till 7-2-1939 or 8-2-1939, when, to quote the appellant's words: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

I accordingly took away these shares and transfer deeds and kept them with my grandfather.\" It is evident then that Haralal never either purchased or affixed the stamps because the deeds remained in the appellant's custody and that of his grandfather from the night of 13-1-1939. 15. This evidence has been disbelieved by both the courts below, and even if we were to depart from our usual rule regarding the reassessment of evidence which has been concurrently accepted or rejected in the courts below, we would have been unable to reach any different conclusion ourselves. 16. There are only two witnesses, the appellant (DW 3) and one of the two attesting witnesses Satish Chandra Seal (DW 2). Their story does not sound likely. There are improbabilities in them which have not been explained. The mystery about the stamps is one. Why the name of the transferee and the date should have been left for another to fill in and why no attempt was made to register the transfers in the companies' books till after Haralal's death are two more. Haralal was then in good health. He did not fall ill till two-and-a-half months later and did not die till 13-5-1939, that is, not for a further two-and-a- halfmonths. One would have thought that with the onset of this illness, after two serious ones previously, he would at least have sent a letter to the companies, or that the appellant himself would have taken action while Haralal was still alive. 17. We have little doubt that Haralal did intend to gift these shares either to his daughter or to the appellant. It may be that he was hesitating as to which, or it may be he did not want to part with them till his end approached, otherwise he would then have had nothing left, or it may be he wanted something more secure for his daughter. One can speculate indefinitely. The fact remains that he did not complete the transfer; so the appellant gets no title. 18. The appeal is dismissed but we feel that each party should bear its own costs throughout. We make this direction because the plaintiffs have not only persisted in a case found by the High Court to be false but also because they called two witnesses who cast scandalous and wholly unnecessary aspersions of a very cruel nature on Promoda Bala' s character.
