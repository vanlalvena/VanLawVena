The instant application has been filed under Section 5 of Limitation Act, for seeking condonation of delay of 1295 days, in filing the present application, seeking leave to appeal against the verdict of acquittal made by the learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Phillaur on 31.01.2015, in respect of offences punishable under Sections 436, 323, 506, 148, 149 of IPC. 2. However, since the above period of delay is immense, besides when no sufficient cause has emerged in explication of the above gross inordinate delay, which has occurred in the institution of the instant application before this Court, hence seeking leave to appeal against the verdict of acquittal (supra). Resultantly, the above gross insufficiently explained delay, but constrains this Neutral Citation No:=2022:PHHC:131530-DB 1 of 2 ::: Downloaded on - 03-10-2024 13:38:07 ::: CRM-6918-2019 IN/AND CRM-A-493-2019 -2- Court to dismiss the instant application seeking condonation of delay of 1295 days in the institution of the relevant application before this Court. 3.
