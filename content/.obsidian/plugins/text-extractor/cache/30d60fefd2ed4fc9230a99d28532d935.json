The opinions of representative bodies should not be lightly brushed aside unless of course there is reason to think that they have acted out of considerations other than relevant. We are of opinion that the order passed by the District Magistrate post haste immediately he received the appellant's reply without either giving him the copies asked for or at least telling him that the material already furnished was sufficient to enable him to make his representation and if he had any further representation to make he could do so offends the principles of natural justice. We arc aware that we are dealing with an appeal questioning the proceedings initiated under Article 226 of the Constitution where the power of the Court is a limited one, that is to say, limited to cases where there is any error of law apparent on the face of the record . But the observance of. the principles of natural justice is fundamental to the discharge of any quasi-judicial function. We therefore allow the appeal and set aside the order of the District Magistrate. There will be no order as to costs. (1976) l Supreme Court Cases 128 /Before A. N. Ray, C.J . and K. K. Mathew , V.

DWARKA DAS SARAF 129 The core of the controversy here is (a) whether the lease is of the bQilding, the fittings and other fixtures merely making for the beneficial enjoyment of and ancillary to the building, as urged by the tenant, or whether the building provides a bare, though appropriately designed, enclosure to house an enterprise, the dominant purpoc;e of real subject of the lease being the cinema, apparatus and fittings, including subsidiarily and incidentally, though necessarily, the structure of brick and mortar ; and (b) whether the cinema, to fall within the exclusionary cl,rnse added by the amending Act, must be actually a going concern with all the licenses for showing films and running the theatre being in the name of the lesc;or. Lastly, the effect of the repeal of the Act and the opening provision of the later Act of 1972 putting cinemac; out of its application, has been debated. Held: (a) The main definition of 'accommodation' in the Act brings within its sweep not all kinds of buildings nor all types of realty leases. The protected category i,; confined to those species of leases whose purpose and subject-matter answer the st::itutory prescriptionc;. More explicitly the wider connotation or Jictionary meanin~ of 'accommodation' must yield to the definitional delimitation.

(Para 13) The conc;pectu,; of factors settles the issue in favour of the landlord who contend<; that what has been granted i-. a lease of a cinema business and, at any rate. the real intent of the partiec; to the lease was to demise primarily the cinema equipment and c;econdarily the building, the lease itself being a cnmposite one . (Para 13) Here the fixtures were not for the more beneficial enjoyment of the building. On the contrary. the posc;esc;ion of the building is made over as an integral part of. and incidental to. the makin~ over of the cinema apparatus and costly appliances. The fixtures are the primary object which the lease was intended to cover and the buildinc in which the fixture,; are located comes in incidentally. (Paras 20 & 2S) The addition of the proviso was to dispel confusion from this region and to exclude what ,;eemingly might be leases only of buildings but in truth might be Jeac;ec; of business. The Legislature by the amending Act clarified what was impli- cit earlier and expressly carved out what otherwise might be mistakenly covered by the main definition. The proviso does not, in this case, expand, by imnlication, the protected area of building tenancies to embrace 'business' leases. (Para 16) Uttam Cl,nnd v . S .

Garg (for the appellant) and Shri V. M. Tarkunde (for the respondent). Shortly put, the legal issues are only three : (A) Is a cinema theatre, equipped with projectors and other fittings and ready to be launched as an entertainment house, an 'accommodation' as defined in Section 2 ( 1) ( d) of the U. P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947 (U. P. Act III of 194 7) ( tor short, the Act)? (B) If it is an 'accommodation' as so defined. what is the impact of the proviso brought in by amendment in 1954 ( Act XVII of 1954) (for short, the Amending Act)? (C) If the Act barricades eviction by the landlord because the premises let consti- tutes an 'accommodation\\ does the repeal of the Act and exclusion of cinema houses altogether from the operation of the 1972 Act (U. P. Act 13 of 1972) (for short, the later Act) rescue the right of the appellant- landlord to eject the tenant-respondent ? 3. The building covered by the suit is admittedly one built and adapted for screening films. The plaintiff had been carrying on a cinema business in this theatre for a long number of years but, when he disconti- nued, the defendant approached him in January, 1952 for the grant of a lease of the building with all the equipment and fittings and furniture necessary for. his operating the cinema. The necessary certificates, sanc- tions and permissions, preliminary to the conduct of cinema shows, stood in the name of the plaintiff, including water-pipe connection, electricity supply and structural fitness. Before commencement of cinema shows, a licence is necessary under the U. P. Cinemas (Regulation) Act and this licence has to be taken out by the actual operator of the cinema and not by the landlord of the theatre and equipments. Therefore, once the lease for the entire building and cinema proiector, accessories and the like was finalised, the deed ol demise was actually executed, it being provided that the commencement of the lease would synchronize with the inaugural cinema show on March 25, 1953. It was provided in the lease deeds that the rent for the building, simpliciter, may be shown separately from that attributable tci the costly equipments, for the purposes of property tax and other taxes. By this apportionment, the building, as such, was to bear a burden of Rs . 400 per mensem by way of rent and a monthly i;um of Rs. 1,000 was fixed for the projector and all other items fixed in the building. The leases were renewed from time to time till 1959. The rnit for eviction was based on these leases which formed the foundation of the action. 4. At this stage it mav be noticed that the learned Counsel for the defendant-trnant 'did not dispute that running a cinema business did constitute an industrial. purpose so that the accommodation was used for an industrial purpose'. Another significant fact admitted by the defen- dant's Counsel befote the High Court was 'that for the purpose of this cm,e, in i;pite C1f there being separate documents of lease in re~pect of the demised properties as referred to above, these sets of contracts may be treated as a 5ingle transactzbn each time'. On these facts and circum- stances. we have to decide whether the subiect-matter of the demise is an 'accommodation' within the meaning of the Act. After settling this issue, the other two points adverted to above may have to be considered. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The suit , on this view, had to be dismissed. The aggrieved landlord has come up to challenge this judgment. 5. Let us now take a close-up of the definition of 'accommodation' in the Act and apply it to the admitted facts here. Section 2 (a), as it stood at the time of the first lease, ran thus : \"Accommodation\" means residential and non-residential accommodation in any building or part of a building and includes, (i) gardens, grounds and outhouses , of any appurtenant to such building or part of a building ; (ii) any furniture supplied by the landlord for use in such building or part of a building ; (iii) any fitting affixed to such building or part of a building for the more beneficial enjoyment thereof. The Amending Act added a clause reading thus : but does not include any accommodation used as a factory or for an industrial purpose where the business carried on in or upon the building is also leased out to the lessee by the c;ame transaction, at the end of clause (a). We have to go by the amended definition in the present case . Since the basic fabric of the demise remained the same notwithst~nding several renewals its terms have a bearing on the decision of the case. So we may reproduce it (relevant part) at this stage: We have taken a cinema hall known as Dwarka Prasad Theatre Hall . . . for running a cinema . . . on a monthly rent of Rs . 200 commencing from March 25, 1953. To complete the picture . we quote from the factual summing-up by s~tish Chandra, J .. since it is convenient and uncontested : The same day the defendants executed another lease deed stating that they had taken the Dwarka Theatre Hall on a rent of Rs . 200 per month and that in this building there is new furniture fitted for about 500 seats with ceiling and fittings of electric light and fans, complete machinery, ceiling fans and operating machine to~ether with all articles present in the hall of the theatre a list whereof has been duly signed bv the executant and that they had taken this also on a monthly rent of Rs. 1,100 besides rent of the building . The lease deed dated April 1, 1954 executed by the defendants stated that whereas besides the cinema house popu - larly known as Dwarka Theatre Hall which has been taken on hire of Rs. 200 per month, the defendants had also taken on rent of ·Rs. 800 per month the new furniture with tapestry about 500 seats and ceiling and complete electric fittings including fans and machine and ceiling fans and operating machine together with the entire paraphernalia present in the theatre hall. The defendants in this lease deed stated that they had taken the building on rent to continue rnnnin~ a cinema. The lease deed of January 10, 1956 was a confirmation of the sam..: c;ubject-rnatter of the lease. It appears that by now the landlord was fitting new furniture in the hall and for that reason the rent was increased to Rs. 1,200 per month. Simi- larly , in the lease deed dated May 26, 1959 the defendants stated that they have ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

DWARKA DAS SARAF (Krishna Iyer, J.) 133 taken a cinema hall known as Dwarka Theatre Hall on a monthly rent of Rs.400 and the furniture of about 500 seats, ceiling, electric fittings, with fans, complete machine, ceiling fans, operating machine and other articles present in the theatre hall, a list whereof was attached, on a monthly rent of Rs.1,000. Let us revert to the law. 'Accommodation', in plain English, may cover cinema houses with or without fittings. But legislative drafting does not always leave things that easy. Had there been a definition of 'controlled accommodation', he who runs and reads would have gathered the intend- ment of the statute. Here is a further complication introduced by the addition of a proviso of sorts by the amending Act and a whole host of authorities on the canons of construction and functional role of a proviso and its indJrect impact on the main provision has been brought to our notice. Does a proviso carve out something from the whole ? Does it serve an independent enacting purpose? We do not think that legislative simplicity is an abstruse art, provided we reform our drafting methodology. The Renton Committee in England highlighted the impor- tance of easy comprehensibility of law and wrote : There is hardly any part of our national life or of our personal lives that is not affected by one statute or another. The affairs of local authorities, nationalised industries, public corporations, and private commerce are regulated by legis- lation. The life of the ordinary citizen is affected by various provisions of the statute book from cradle to grave . The instant case which deals with a legislation affecting the shelter of common people brings up the same problem. 6. The main definition of 'accommodation' in the Act brings within its sweep not all kinds of buildings nor all types of realty leases. The protected category is confined to those species of leases whose purpose and subject-matter answer the statutory prescriptions. More explicitly, the wider connotation or dictionary meaning of 'accommodation' must yield to the definitional delimitation. The core of the controversy here is (a) whether the lease is of the building, the fittings and other fixtures merely making for the beneficial enjoyment of and ancillary to the build- ing, as urged by the tenant, or whether the building provides a bare, though appropriately designed, enclosure to house an enterprise, the dominant purpose of real subject of the lease being the cinema, apparatus and fittings, including subsidianly and incidentally, though necessarily, the structure of brick and mortar ; and ( b) whether the cinema, to fall within the exclusionary clause added by the amending Act, must be actually a going concern with all the licenses for showing films and running the theatre being in the name of the lessor. Lastly, the effect of the repeal of the Act and the opening provision of the later Act putting cinemas out of its application, has been debated at the Bar. 7. The Central Act (The Cinematograph Act) and the State Act (The U. P. Cinema Regulation Act) govern the exhibition of films and it is not in dispute that the theatre had been built for and used as a cinema house even before the tirst lease to the respondent in 19.53. The further agreed facts are that when the last renewed lease of I? 59 yvith whic~ we are directly concerned was executed, there was a running cinema business and further that the rent apportioned for the building qua building was ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Looklng at the three-problems posed, unaided by the many deci- sions cited by Counsel, we are inclined to the view that a lease of an •accommodation' must essentially be of a building - not a business or industry together with the building in which it is situated. Of course, a building which is ordinarily let, be it for residential or non-residential purposes, will not be the bare walls, floor and roof, but will have neces- sary amenities to make habitation happy. That is why the Legislature has fairly included gardens, grounds and outhouses, if any, appurtenant to such building. Likewise, leases sometimes are of furnished buildings and that is why ·any furniture supplied by the landlord for use in such build- ing' is treated as part of the building. In the same strain, we may notice, as a matter of common occurrence, many fittings 'such as electrical fittings, sanitary fittings, curtains and venetian blinds and air-conditioning equip- ment being fixed to the building by the landlord so that the tenant's enjoy- ment of the tenement may be more attractive. The crucial point is that these additions are appurtenant, subservient and beneficial to the building itself. They make occupation of the building more convenient and plea- sant but the principal thing demised is the building and the additives are auxiliary. Where the lease is composite and has a plurality of purposes, the decisive test is the dominant purpose of the demise. 9. Forgetting for a moment the clause introduced by the amending Act, it is plain that the furniture and fittings visualized in the concept of 'accommodation' are calculated to improve the beneficial enjoyment of the premises leased. Counsel for the tenant has countered this interpreta- tion by an ingenious and plausible submission. He emphasizes that the present building was conceived, designed and structured expressly as a cinema house conforming to the regulations in this behalf and the pur- pose of the owner was to use the auditorium and annexes purely as a cinema house. According to him, when a cinema theatre is erected, it becomes useless unless the necessary equipment for exhibiting films are also fitted up. In this view, the relative cost of the fixtures is immaterial and all these items, however costly, are calculated to fulfil the very object of the construction of the cinema theatre. In short, the fittings and furni- ture and like items are beneficial to and enhance the worth of the building and cannot be divorced or dissected from the whole object which ani- mated the project of the building construction qua a cinema house. So presented, there is a certain attractiveness in the argument, although this facet of interpretat10n does not find a place in the submission on behalf of the respondent in the High Court. 10. What then is the flaw in this submission, or merit in the earlier one? The legislative policy, so far as we can glean from the scheme of the Act, is to control rents and evictions of buildings, rack-renting and profiteering by indiscriminate eviction from buildings, residential and non-residential, being the evil sought to be suppressed. The law sought to rescue exploited tenants of buildings. If this be a sound reading of the mind of the Legislature it is fair to hold that the protected category ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

We have been at pains to explain that the subject-matter of the leases covered by the definition of 'accommodation' is 'any building or part of a building' . We have carefully analysed the inclusive expres- sions in the original definition such as appurtenant gardens, grounds and outhouses, furniture for use in the building and fittings affixed to the building. In this statutory context, gardens, outhouse, furniture and fittings means annexures for the better enjoyment of the building. In this sense, the dominant intention must be to lease the building qua building. If that be the intention, tht: rent control law protects. On the other hand, if a going undertaking such as a running or ready-to-launch and fully equipped cinema hm.15e is covered by the provision, the emphasis is not so much on the building but on the business, actual or imminent. There is nothing in the present definition which helps this shift in accent. 12. We may reinforce our view, from the expressions used, because all the three categories included as additions play a subservient role, while if a business were the subject-matter of the lease, the prominent thing will be not what houses the business but the business itself. The building becomes secondary smce every business or industry has to be accommodated in some enclosure or building. In all such cases, the lessor makes over possession of the building as part and parcel of the transfer of possession of the busi- ness. It would be a travesty of language to speak of a lease of a building when what is substantially made over is a business or industdal plant. l 3. How then do we distinguish between a lease of a business or industry housed in a building frum a building which has fixtures for more beneficial enjoyment? The former is a protected 'accommodation' while the latter is ldt for free market operation . In the present case we have to visualize what was the dominant or decisive component of the tran- saction between the parties, the tenancy of the building qua building or the taking-over of <1 cinema house as a business, the projectors, furniture, fitting and annexes being the moving factor, the building itself playing a secondary, though necessary, role in the calculations of the parties. Going by the rental apportioned, it is obvious that the parties stressed the cinema equipment as by far the more important. Judging by the fact that there had already bi;:en a cinema in this house for several years, with the neces• sary certi.tirates under the various statutes for running a cinema theatre obtained by the landlord and that the lease itself was to commence oLlly from the date of the first show of the films, doubts regarding the essential object and subject of the bargain stand dispelled. The mere circumstance that the lkence for showing films was taken by the tenant is of little conse- quence as the law itself requires it to be in his name. The further cir- cumstance that the term of the lease in one case may yary from the other also where, as here, two deeds are executed, is not a telling factor, in view of the clear admission by Counsel for the respondent that the two lease deeds togethe~ constituted a single transaction and that the le:ise was for an industrial cmrposP, to wit, running a cinema business.

Social jm,tice, legislative policy, legal phraseology and prece- dential wisdom converge to the same point that the scheme of control includes, as its benellciary, premises simpliciter and excludes from its ambit businesses accommodated in buildings. To hold otherwise is to pervert the purpose and distort the language of Section 2(a). 15. The amending clause, argues Shri Tarkunde, strikes a contrary note. For, if the main definition in itself fences off leases of business and industry, why this superfluous proviso expressly excluding accommoda- tion 'used as a factory or for an industrial purpose where the business is carried on in or upon the building is also leased out to a lessee by the same transaction' ? The whole section must be read harmoniously, each part throwing light on the other and redundancy being frowned upon. A proviso carves out of a larger concept and the argument is that the need for the e,cclusionarv clause itself shows that otherwise factorieli and busi- nesses are within the operational area of the main definition. 16. There is some validity in this submission but if, on a fair con- struction, the principal provision is clear, a proviso cllD.Ilot expand or Jim.it it. Sometime~ a proviso is engrafted by an apprehensive draftsman to remove possible doubts, to make matters plain, to light up ambiguous edges. Here, such is the case. In a country where factories and industries may still be in the developmental stage, it is not unusual to come across several such units which may not have costly machinery or plant or fittings and superficially consist of bare buildings plus minor fixtures. For example, a beedi factory or nandicraft or carpentry unit - a few tools, some small contrivances or coflection of materials housed in a building, will super- ficially look like a mere 'accommodation' but actually be a humming factory or business with a goodwill as business, with a prosperous reputation and a name among the business community and customers. Its value is qua business, although it has a habitation or building to accommodate it. The personality of the thing let out is a going concern or enterprise, not a lifeless edifice. The Legislature, quite conceivably, thought that a margi- nal, yet liUbstantial, class of buildings, with minimal equipments may still be good businesses and did not require protection as in the case of ordi- nary building tenancies. So, to dispel confusion from this region and to exclude what seemingly might be leases only of buildings but in truth might be leases of businesses, the Legislature introduced the exclusionary proviso. 17. While rulings and text books bearing on statutory construction have assigned many functions for provisos, we have to be selective, hav- ing regard to the text and context of a statute. Nothing is gained by extensive references to luminous classics or supportive case-law. Having explained the approach we inake to the specific 'proviso' situation in Sec- tivn 2 (a) of the Act, what strikes us as meaningful here is that the Legis- lature by the amending Act clarified what was implicit earlier and expressly ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

We may mention in fairness to Counsel that the following, among otht-r decisions, were cited at the Bar bearing on the uses of provi- sos in statutes: C. I. T. v. lndo-!vfercantile Bank Ltd.1,· M/s. Ram Narain Sons Ltd. v. A~stt. C. S. T. 2 ; Thompson v. Dibdin 3 ; Rex v. Dibdin 4 and Tahsildar Singh v. State oJ U. P. 5 • The law is trite. A proviso must be limited to the subJt·ct-mattcr of the enacting clause. It is a settled rule of constructio'1 thal a proviso must prima facie be read and considered in relation to the principal matter to which it is a proviso. It is not a separate 0r indeperntent enactment. 'Words are dependent on the principal enacting worac, to which they are tacked as a proviso. They cannot be read as divorced from their context' (1912 AC 544). If the rule of con- struction 1s that prima facie a proviso should be limited in it,;, operation to the subject-matter of the enacting clause, the stand we have taken is sound. To expand the enacting clause, inflated by the proviso, sins against the fundamental rule of construction that a proviso must be considered in relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso. A proviso ordinarily is but a proviso. although the golden rule is to read the whole section, inclusive ot the proviso, in such manner that they mutually throw light on each other and result in a harmonious construction. The proper course is to apply the broad general r,ule of construction which is that a section or enactmenl must be construed a5 a whole, each portion throw- ing light 1f need be on the rest. The true principle undoubtedly is, that the suund interpretation and meaning of the statute, on a view of the enacting clause, ~aving clause, and proviso, taken and construed together is to prevail. (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Edn., p 162) J 9. We now move on to 'dominant intent' as the governing rule. ln our view, the doJ11..inant intent is found in leading decision of this Court. lndeed, c;ome 5tate Legislatures, accepting the position that where the dominant iPtention Clf the lease is the enJoyment of a citizen, as distinguished from the ouiJrling, have deliberately amended the definition by suitable changes (e.g. Kernla and Andhra Pradesh) while other Legislatures, on the opposite policy decision, have ' expressly excluded the rent control enact- ment (e g., the later Act). 20. In Uttam Chanct v. S. M. Labvani 6 this Court had to consider an analogous position under the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act where also the term 'accommodation' was defined substantially in the same language. The Court was considering the grant of the lease of a dal mill vis-a-•;ic; ·accommodation'. as defined in that Act.

The learned Chief Justice observed : What then was the dominant intention of the parties when they entered into the present transaction ? We have already set out the material terms of the lease and it seems to us plain that the dominant intention of the appellant in accepting the lease from the respondent was to use the building as a dal mill. It is true that the document purports to be a lease in respect of the dal mill building ; but the said description is not decisive of the matter because even if the inten- tion of the parties was to let out the mill to the appellant, the building would still have to be described as the dal mill building. It is not a case where the subject-matter of the lease is the building and along with the leased building incidentally passes the fixture of the machinery in regard to the mill ; in truth, it is the mill which is the subject-matter of the lease, and it was because the mill was intended to be let out that the building had inevitably to be let out along with the mill. The fact that the appellant contends that the machinery which was transferred to him under the lease was found to be not very serviceable and that he had to bring in his own machinery, would not alter the character of the transaction. This is not a lease under which the appellant entered into possession for the purpm,e of residing in the building at all ; this is a case where the appellant entered into the lease for the purpose of running the dal miJI which was located in the building. It is obvious that a mill of this kind will have to be located in some building or another, and so, the mere fact that the lease purports to be in respect of an accommodation as defined by Section 3(a)(y)(3). The fixture~ des- cribed in the schedule to the lease are in no sense intended for the more benefi- cial enjoyment of the building. The fixtures are the primary object which the lease was intended to cover and the building in which the fixtures are located comes in incidentally. That is why we think the High Court was right in corn- mg to the conclm,ion that the rent which the appellant had agreed to · pay to the respondent under the document in question cannot be said to be rent payable for any accommodation to which the Act applies. The ratio of that case is that the Court must apply the test of 'dominant intention of the parties' to determine the character of the lease, i. e., what was the primary purpose of the parties in executing the document ? The mere fact that the demise deals with a building does not bring it within the ambit of accommodation. In the case before us, the fixtures are not for the more beneficial enjoyment of the building. On the contrary, the possession of the building is made over as an integral part of, and inci- dental to, the making over of the cinema apparatus and costly appliances. In the language of the learned Chief Justice in Uttam Chand (supra) the 'fixtures are the primary object which the lease was intended to cover and the building m whil.:h the fixtures are located, comes in incidentally'. 21. The folh>wing decisions were relied on, or referred to, by Counsel for the appellant: Raja Chetty v. Jagannathadas 7 ;' Mohd. Jaffer Ali v. S. R. Rao 8 ; Govindan v. Kunhi/ekshmi Amma 9 22. Rajamannar, C.J. t>peaking for the Division Bench in Raja Chetty's case (supra) dealt with the case of a lease of a cinema theatre in Madras in relation to the rent control law as it obtained in that State then. In that connection, the learned Chief Justice observed : We h,1vc come to the conclusion that the lessors' application in this ,;ase is not maiutainable on other ground<; as well. In our opinion the lea~e in q11estion is not governed by the provisions of Madras Act, XV of I 946. That Act regu- lates only the letting of re~idential and non-residential buildings..

DWARKA DAS SARAF (Xrishna Iyer, J.) 139 buildmg has been defined as to include the garden, grounds and outhouses appur- tenant to the building and furniture supplied by the landlord for use in such building. In the ca<;e before us, there is no lease of a mere building or a build~ ing with compound and furniture of the sort covered by the definition. The lease is of lund and building together with fixtures, fittings, cinematographic talk.ie- equipments, m,tchincry and other articles . The lessors, evidently aware of the composite nature of the demise, have prayed in their petition for eviction of the lessee-, from the land and buildmgs only. On behalf of the respondent, Mr. K . V. Ran1<1chand1a Iyer relied strongly on the provision in the deed which splits up the monthly rent and hire of Rs. 3,200 into Rs. 1,600 being rent for the ground and supcrstructure, R!>. 800 being hire of furniture and Rs. 800 being hire of talkie equipment!> and machinery. fittings and lessors' fixtures. We have no hesita- tion in holding tlldt this i,iplitting is purely notional and nominal and intended probably for purpo!>e!> relating to the municipal assessment and other extraneous com,ider ,1tions. When we asked Mr. Ramachandra Iyer what would happen, in th1!> \"'ase when there 1s an eviction of the lessees from the land and building, to the machinery and equipments etc., and whether there was any provision in the deed relating to them, he confessed that there was no specific provision in the deed. Obviously they cannot be governed by Madras Act XV of 1946 and so he said they must be governed by the general law of contract. He also con- ceded that if the lessees paid Rs.1,600 but defaulted in the payment of the balance which is due a:- hire, the lessors have no right to ask for eviction under the Rent Control Act. We think that the attempted division of the lease and separation of rights in regard to two classes of property is in the highest degree artificial, never contemplated by the parties. Here is a lease of a talkie house with everything that is neces:,,ary to run cinema shows. To split up such a com- posite lease as this into separate contracts of lease and hire is to destroy it alto- gether. Mr. Ramachandra Iyer argued that the furniture which was covered by the lease fell within the definition of Section 2 of the Act. We do not agree. The observations of the learned Judges in App. No. 590 of 1945 (Patanjali Sastri and Bell, JJ .) in dealing with tflc plant, machinery and other moveables which were demised along with a factory are very apposite in this connection : No doubt m one !>em,e the buildings comprised in the lease deed con- tarn articles supplied by the landlord, but we cannot agree that what was !>0 supplied can be considered in any modern sense as being furniture . Though m that case the learned Judges were dealing with the lease of a factory called the West Coa<;t Match Co., which consisted of land and buildings including a bungalow used for residential purposes together with plant, machinery and moveable,; contained therein, we think the principle of that decision would appl}'. equally to th~ case before u~ in which there is _a lease not merely_ ?~ a building hut ot a cu~ma theatre \"'Ith all necessary equipment for the exh1buron of films . 23 . lt is true that in Jaffer Ali's case (supra) and in Govindan's case (supra) (the Andhra and Kerala decisions referred to above) cinema theatres have been he]d to fall within the definition of building, under the relevant rent l ontrol law of those States. A bare reading of the two cases would show that certain amendments had been made to the parent statutes whercbv the definition was expanded and its wide range was made to include· all tenancies relating to all structures, even though accessories, furnitu1c and fittings for use in the house were also made over. Thc,·c i~ no doubt that the word 'fittings• may take in a projector or other apparatus w,ed for a cinema but it is one thing to say that appa- ratu<; is lixed in a budding and it is another to say that such fixture or apparatus •s for tl•e beneficial enjoyment of the building. Therefore it depends on the words used reflecting the legislative policy of each State ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Venkata Subba Rao 10 a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court considered whether the lease of a fixtu1e ..:omprising buildings and machinerv came within the sweep of the rent control law. The Court held that the lease of a running factory, comrrising co~tly machinery intended to be used for manufac- ture, Jid not fall within the definition. The question, in each case, the learned Judge<; pornted out, would be what is the dominant part of the demise and what the main purpose for which the building was let out is. In Amritlal lv . Shah v. Annapurnamma 11 the same court held that the lease ot a cinema did not come within the purview of Madras Act 25 of 1949. Dernitio11al ramifications need not detain us nor decisions turn- ing on them . 24. 'ihri Tari<..unde pressed upon us the decision in Karsandas v. Karsanji 12 and Karnanz Properties Ltd. v. Miss Augustine 13 • One of them did refer to a dnerna theatre with fittings and generators. Certain Calcutta decisions, Ka1i Pro.sad v. Jagadish Pada 11 and D.S. Jain v. Meghmala Roy 1s wefc aim cited before us. In all these cases, the decision turned on the pn:cbe language used. We do not see any need to discuss these and the other decision~ cited before us because we have explained why the conclu- sion we have reached is in consonance with the sense, purpose and langu- age of the Act. for the same reason we cont~nt ourselves with merely mentioning that in Hariszngh v. Ratanla/1 6 a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court held that a fully equipped cinema theatre let out for <;howing hlms of a commercial basis, being of a running cinema theatre , fell out of the scope of accommodation on the score that costly fittings, frxtures and equipment could, in no sense, be regarded and meant for the beneficial c'njoyment of the building in which the cinema theatre was housed . The primary object and the definitional language used deter- mine the issue. 25 . Re,pondent's Counsel did try to approximate the definition in the Act to th.H found in the enactments with reference to which decisions in his favour had been rendered. We do not agree. To hail-split is an unhappy interpretative exercise. Here the plain intendment is to encom- pass leases of buildings only (inclusive of what renders them more con- genial) but nnt ol businesses accommodated in buildings nor ,>f premises let out with the predominant purpose of running a business. A lease of a lucrative th..'alre with expensive cinema equipment, which latter pressed the lessee to go i11to the transaction, cannot reasonably be reduced into a mere tenancy of a builuing together with fittings which but make the m . .::! more comfortable. 26. For these reasons we hold that the lease sued on does not fall within the ~cope of the definition of 'accommodation'. The appellant 1s, therefore, entitled 11..• a decree for eviction in allowance of his appeal. 10. AIR 1 ')57 Al' h1 9 · 1956 An<lh V\\R 13. AIR 1957 SC 309. 1093 14. AIR 1953 Cal 14-9. I I.
