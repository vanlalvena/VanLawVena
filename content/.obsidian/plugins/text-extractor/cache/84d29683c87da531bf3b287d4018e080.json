Chowdhary. Although in the FIR, the names of three accused are specifically mentioned none of them has been implcaded as a respondent to these proceedings by any one of the appel- lants. Even Mr Martin Ardbo, former President of M/s AB. Bofors, who was impleaded as a proforma respondel!t in Criminai Appeal No. 310 of 1991 has been given up by the Solicitor General. Therefore, under these circumstances, one should not lose sight of the significant fact that in case this Court pronounces its final opinion or conclusions on the issues mher than the general issues raised by the appellants as public interest litigants, without hearing the really affected person/persons, such opinion or conclusions may, in future, in case the investigation culminates in filing a final report become detrimental and prejudicial to the indicated accused persons who would be totally deprived of challenging such opinion or conclusions of this apex court, even if they happen to come in possession of some valuable material to canvass the correctness of such opinion or conclusions and consequently their vested legal right to defend their case in their own way would be completely nullified by the verdict now sought to be obtained by these public interest litigants. (Para 25) Even if t_hcre arc million questions of law to be deeply gone into and examined in a criminal case of this nature registered against specified accused persons, it is for them and them alone to raise all such questions and challenge the proceedings initiated against them at , the appropriate time before the proper forum and not for thi1d parties under the garb of public interest litigants.

The Central Bureau of Investigation/Delhi Police &tablish- c ment/Anti-Corruption Unit-IV, New Delhi registered the first informa- tion report dated January 22, l 990 relating to Crime No. RCl/(A)/90/ACU-IVt under Section 120-B read with Sections 161, 162, 163, 164 and 165-A of the Indian Penal Code read with Sections 5(2), 5(l)(d) and 5(2)/5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947 d (herein referred lo as P.C. Act) read with Sections 409,420, 468 and 471 ,of the Indian Penal Code against 14 accused of whom 3 arc named, they being ( 1) Shri Marlin Ardho, former President of M/s A.B. Bofors, Sweden (accused 1); (2) Shri Chadha alias Win Chadha, S/o Shri A~sa Nand, President of M/s Anatronic General Corporation/Analronic Gen- e eral Companies Ltd., C/4, Main Market, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi (accused 3) and Shri G.P.

The rest of the 11 accused arc stated in gen- eral as dircctors/cmployces/holders/bcneficiaries of account· code and f public servants of the Government of India. The core of the allegations is that these accused, named and unnamed, entered into a criminal con- spiracy, obtained illegal gratification in the form of money from BOFORS, a Swedish company through the agent firm~/companies/ per- sons as motive or reward for such public servants who by corrupt or g illegal means or by otherwise dishonestly using their official position as public servants caused pecuniary advantage to themselves, BOFORS, the agents and others in awarding contracts to BOFORS for the supply of guns to the Government of India and in the transaction also committed the offences of criminal breach of trust, cheating of Union of India, for- h gery and using of forged documents etc. It appears that the CBI has com- menced its investigation during the course of which it has recorded state- ments of witncs.~es and took into their custody various documents and files relating to this Bofors deal. 3.

Bofors from Sweden, that in particular, the authorised signatories and the benefi- ciaries of the said accounts have to be traced by such investigation as they are, in fact, the ultimate beneficiaries of the payments made by M/s AB. Bofors and that under the procedure followed by banks in Switzer- land, an authorised signatory can operate an account for the benefit of certain other persons regarding whom the authorised signatory has to submit certain declarations to the concerned bank and, therefore, it is very essential for the investigation of this case that the documentary and oral evidence should be collected regarding this as well as the other aspects of the bank accounts in Switzerland. In the said application after referring to the exchange or letters dated February 20, 1989 between the Government of India and Switzerland for mutual assistance .agreeing that the authorities of both the countries shall provide to each other the widest measure for assistance in the investigation of criminal matters, it has been stated that the competent authority to ask for assistance in India and abroad is the court/tribunal/judge or magistrate exercising jurisdiction. The Dir{..'-Ctor of the CBI sent a request dated January 23, 1990 and supplemented by another request dated January 26, 1990 to the concerned authorities in Switzerland for freezing/blocking certain bank accounts relevant to this case and the Federal Department of Justice and Police, Switzerland moved Shri Parraudin, Judge of Geneva and the con- cerned Judge of Zurich who, on being prima facie convinced of dual criminality and the need for investigation in Switzerland, froze the relevant bank accounts in this regard on January 26, 1990 as intimated by the Federal Department of Justice and Police through the Embassy of India in Switzerland and that as per this information, the relevant accounts in the bank have been blocked up to February 28, 1990 and that request for judicial assistance from Switzerland in this matter, therefore, should be made by February 28, 1990 failing which the Swiss law obliges the withdrawal of instructions to block the accounts and that the Federal Department of Justice and Police at Berne which corresponds to the Ministries of Law and Home, Government of India, have assured that the Swiss authorities would render assistance in the investigation in Swit- zerland in accordance with the mutual assistance agreement dated Feb- ruary 20, 1989 only on receipt of a Letter Rogatory from the competent judicial authorities in India. a b C d e f g h i ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On the above pleadings, the CBI requested the Special Judge to send a Letter Rogatory/request to Switzerland urgently for getting the necessary assistance in the investigation to be conducted in Switzerland lest very important and relevant evidence would remain uncollected and the cause of justice would be frustrated. The Special Judge after hearing Shri Arun Jaitley, the then Additional Solicitor General of India and Shri KN. Sharma, Deputy Legal Adviser, CBI and Shri Baljit Sin,gh, Senior Public Prosecutor by its considered order dated February 5, 1990 allowed the application of the CBI, the relevant portion of which reads thus: \"In the result, the application of the CBI is allowed lo the extent that a request to conduct the necessary investigat1ion and lo collect necessary evidence which can be collected in Switzerland and to the extent directed in this order shall be made to the Competent Judicial Authorities of the Confederation of Switzerland through the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India subject Lo the filing of the requisite/proper undertaking required by the Swiss law and assurance for reciprocity.\" 5. The Special Judge also directed certain documents to be sent along with his letter of request, such as the copy of the FIR dated January 22, 1990, mutual assistance agreement dated February 20, 1989 etc. etc. The court finally made a note reading thus: \"Needless to mention that no observation made in this order shall tantamount to expression of opinion at any subsequent stage of enquiry or trial.\" 6. When the matter stood thus, Shri V.S. Aggarwal on the strength of the notification issued by the Administrator of the Union territory of Delhi assumed charge as a Special Judge in place of Shri R.C. Jain. Before Shri Aggarwal, the Special Judge, Shri Harinder Singh Chowdhary, an advocate riled a public interest litigation by filing Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 12 of 1990 under Article 51-A of the Constitution of India seeking the following prayers whic:h we arc reproducing hereunder: \"In the premises your petitioners humbly request that in order to maintain the dig11ity, prestige and the fair name of the country and the ideals enshrined in the Constitution that no rogaitory letter be issued on the formal request of the CBI unless the allegations against named persons are established to the satisfaction of this Hon'ble Court: It is further requested that no request for rogatory or freezing bank account be made to Swiss Government unless the concerned persons are noticed and heard on the subject: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Shri Harinder Singh Chowdhary, the public interest litigant on d being aggrieved by the order dated August 18, 1990 of the Special Judge filed a criminal revision before the High Court of Delhi under Sections 397/482 o( the Code of Criminal Procedure and raised several questions of law challenging the legality and validity of the impugned order and made the following prayers: (a) to quash the entire FIR No. RC.I(A) 90/ACU-IV dated January 22, 1990 and criminal proceedings covered by the same.

(M) No. 1821 of 1990 passed an order dated December 3, 1990 directing all the applications for intervention to be kept on record and observed, b \"The intcrveners will be heard only if the Court feels the necessity of hearing further arguments after the conclusions of the arguments of ASG appearing for the GOI and the CBI\". Thereafter on December 6 and 7, 1990, Mr Justice M.K. Chawla heard the arguments advanced on behalf of the CBI as well of the Union of India. While it was so, the c Janata Dai etc. approached this Court by filing a Special Leave P<;tition (Criminal) No. 2320 of 1990 and this Court on December 10, 1990 upon being mentioned and hearing the learned counsel for the parties, passed the following order: d e f \"We find on December 3, 1990 the learned Judge indicated in his order that several applications had been filed by different people for implcadmcnt/intervention in the proceedings and the learned Judge observed that these applications would be heard aind if neces- sary arguments on behalf of the intervener could be permitted after other counsel arc heard. Grievance has been made that these applicalions have not been formally disposed of by the court. We arc of the view that the learned Judge should dispose of these applica- tions by a judicial order before the matter is reserved for judgmcnl and in case the applications arc not accepted, judgmcntl should not be delivered for at least 2 days after such an order on these writ peti- tions is made to enable them lo move this Court.\" 12. It appears that in compliance of the above directions of this Court, Mr Justice Chawla heard Mr Ram Jethmalani who appeared on behalf of Janala Dai and Mr Prashant Bhushan on December 11, 1990. The learned counsel, Mr Jcthmalani orally requested Justice Chawla to 9 recuse himself from the case which request was rejected by the learned Judge.

Mr Anand Dev Giri, the learned Solicitor-General assisted by Mis Anil Katyar and Ashok Bhan and thereafter the present Additional Solicitor- General, Mr Altaf Ahmad, Mr A. Subba Rao and Mr A.M.

Bhagat, the learned senior counsel appearing in Criminal Appeal Nos. 306 and 305 of 1991 on behalf of Mr H.S. Chowdhary assisted by Mr M.N. Shroff, besides a battery of lawyers advanced their respective d arguments raising manifold questions of law with reference to the various provisions of the Constitution of India, Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure and other Acts and the Memorandum of Understanding etc. for a very considerable length of time totally running for 34 full days and laid stress upon a host of decisions in support of their respective cases. The intro e vertcd ~nd extroverted rh~torical submissions made by all the learned coun-scl were punctuated sometimes with inflammatory remarks. occasionally with discordant and embittered notes as well as esoteric statements, intermiuently with political overtones, but at the same time with admirable ability exhibiting their profound knowledge in criminal f law. In fact, each one of them was trying lo outwit and score a march over the other. In this connection, it may be pointed out that the present Additional Solicitor General, Mr Altaf Ahmad has declared unambiguously and perspicuously that he is in full agreement with the argument of the former Solicitor General, l\\,fr AD. Giri and that his g present articulation serves only as supplement to that of the former Solicitor General. Though the entire submissions made hy the former Solicitor General arc not being extracted in this short order, we feel that it would he appropriate to hrieny refer to the core of the submissions of the learned Solicitor General, Mr AD. Giri. The learned Solicitor Gen- h eral strenuously urged that Mr H.S. Chowdhary claiming to he a public interest litigant has filed the original petition before tpe Special Judge as a proxy of the accused who arc all behind the curtain and who by this perilous proceeding are trying to evade the dragnet of the investigation t Vide Corrigendum No .

CHOWDHARY (Pan.dian., J.) 767 and of whom even the named accused are maintaining stoic silence all through unmindful of all the proceedings till date and that the CBI though subjected to increasing uncharitable and unwarranted criticism and vilification and also scurrilous attack, with remarkable resilience is relentlessly attempting to collect all available materials by unearthing the wider conspiracy and well knitted illegal transaction within its legally permissible limits. It is pertinent to mention that Mr Altaf Ahmed, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Union of India and CBI after Mr AD. Giri (the former Solicitor Ge:neral) has relinquished his office, reinforced the same arguments and further pleaded that the matter should be disposed of before the end of August 1991 for the reasons stated supra so that the CBI may effectively carry on with the investigation. However, we are not at present giving the details of the points urged except observing that the question as to whether the laws are so petrified as to be unable to respond to the challenges made will be dealt with in detail in our main judgment. As mentioned albeit we, in order to avoid further delay in these matters, are inclined to give only our conclusions, the reasons in support of which will follow in our detailed judgmenl at a later stage. 25. It is most relevant to note that none of the appellants before this Court save the Union of India and CBI is connected in any way with the present criminal proceeding initiated on the strength of the first informa- tion report which is now sought to be quashed by Mr H.S. Chowdhary. Although in the FIR, the names of three accused are specifically men- tioned none of them has been impleaded as a respondent to these proceedings by any one of the appellants. Even Mr Martin .A.rdbo, for- mer President of M/s AB . Bofors, who was impleaded as a pro forma respondent in Criminal Appeal No. 310 of 1991 has been given up by the Solicitor General. Therefore, under these circumstances, one :should not lose sight of the significant fact that in case this Court pronounces its final opinion or conclusions on the issues other than the general issues raised by the appellants as public interest litigants, without hearing the really affected person/persons, such opinion or conclusions may, in future, in case the investigation culminates in filing a final report become detrimental and prejudicial to the indicated accused persons who would be totally deprived of challenging such opinion or conclusions of this apex court, even if they happen to come in possession of some valuable material to canvass the correctness of such opinion or conclusions and consequently their vested legal right lo defend their case in their own way would be completely nullified by the verdict now sought to be obtained by these public interest litigants. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Even if there are million questions of law to be deeply gone into and examined in a criminal case of this nature registered against specified accused persons, it is for them and them alone to raise all such questions a and challenge the proceedings initiated against them at the appropriate time before the proper forum and not for third parties under the garb of public interest litigants. 27. We, in the above background of the case, after bestowing our anxious and painstaking consideration and careful thought to all aspects b of the case and deeply examining the rival contentions of the parties both collectively and individually give our conclusions as follows: 1. Mr 11.S. Chowdlwry has no locus standi (a) to file the petition under Article 51-A as a public interest litigant praying lhal no letter rogalory/requesl be issued at the request of the CBI and he be c permitted to join the inquiry before the Special Court which on Feb- ruary 5, 1990 directed issuance of letter rogatory/rcquest lo the Competent Judicial Authorities of the Confederation of Switzer- land; (b) to invoke the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Sections 397 read with 401 of the Code of Criminal d Procedure challenging the correctness, legality or propriety of the order dated August 18, 1990 of the Special Judge and (c) lo invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the first informa- tion report dated January 22, 1990 and all other proceedings arising e therefrom on the pica of preventing the abuse of the process of the court. 2. In our considered opinion, the initiation of the present proceedings by Mr H.S. Chowdhary under Article 51-A of the Con- stitution of India cannot come within the true meaning .and scope of f public interest litigation. 3. Consequent upon the above conclusions ( 1) and (2), the appellants namely, Janala Dai, Communist party of India (Marxist) and Indian Congress (Socialist) who are before this Court equally have no right of seeking their impleadment/intervention. For the g same reasons, Dr P. Nalla Thampy Thera also has no right to file the Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 114 of 1991 as a public interest litigant. 4. Having regard lo the facts and circumstances of the case, the suo moto action of Mr Justice M.K. Chawla in taking cognizance in exercise of the powers under Sections 397 and 401 read with Section 482 of the Code based on the convoluted and strained reasoning and directing the office of the High Court of Delhi to register a case under the title Court on its motion v. State and CBl cannot be sustained. h i ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd. ~(!;<D® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h i JANATADALv. H.S. CHOWDHARY (Pandian, J.) 769 Consequent upon the above conclusion No. ( 4), we hold that the directions of Mr Justice M.K. Chawla calling upon the CBI and the State to show cause as to why the proceedings initiated on the strength of the first information report dated January 22. 1990 be not quashed, cannot be sustained. 28. In the result, we agree with the first part of the order dated December 19, 1990 of Mr Justice M.K. Chawla holding that Mr H.S. Chowdhary and other intervening parties have no locus standi. We, however, set aside the second part of the impugned order whereby he has taken suo moto cognizance and issued show cause notice to the State and CBI and accordingly the show cause notice issued by him is quashed. 29. In view of the above conclusions, all the proceedings initiated in pursuance of the first information report dated Jan1:1ary 22, -1990 relating to Crime No. RCI/(A)/90/ACU-IVt on the file of the Special Judge, Delhi including the issuance of the letter rogatory/request as they stand now, remain unaffected and they can be proceeded with in accordance with law. In Summation 30. Criminal Appeal Nos. 304, 305, 306, 307, 308 and 309 of 1991 arc dismissed. Criminal Appeal No. 310 of 1991 filed by the Union of India against the order dated September 5, 1990 of the High Court is dis- missed in view of the fact that the said order does not survive for consid- eration on the passing of the final order dated December 19, 1990. The Writ Petition No. 114 of 1991 is also dismissed. 31. Criminal Appeal No. 311 of 1991 filed by Union of India and CBI is allowed for the reasons stated above.
