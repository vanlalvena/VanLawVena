We have gone through the same and we approve the classification laid down by CEGAT in regard to the subject-matter of controversy and the principles laid down therein. In fact, the said order of the larger Bench was challenged before this Court. This Court in CCE v. Tetragon Chemie (P) Ltd. 2 (three-Judge Bench) upheld the view taken by the Tribunal that the products in question are animal feed supplements and that the animal feed supplements were rightly included in Tariff Item 23.02 being preparation of a kind used in animal feeding including dog and cat food. The Bench has agreed with the conclusion of the Tribunal that even food supplements like the products of the respondents therein which are used in animal feeding would fall under Heading 23.02. This Court while affinning the decision of the Tribunal dismissed the civil appeals. 16. For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the contentions in the civil appeal are apparently contrary to the stand taken by the Department in the circulars mentioned supra and we, therefore, have no hesitation in dismissing the appeal as bereft of any merits.

STATE OF JHARKHAND 553 The whole object of the 1986 Act and the 2000 Act is to provide for the care, protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of juveniles. The Acts being benevolent legislations, an interpretation must be given which would advance the cause of the legislation i.e. to give benefit to the juveniles. Section 2(l) of the 2000 Act defines '1uvenile in conflict with law\" as meaning a juvenile who is alleged to have committed an offence. The notable distinction between the definitions of the 1986 Act and the 2000 Act is that in the 1986 Act \"juvenile in conflict with law\" is absent. The definition of delinquent juvenile in the 1986 Act is referable to an offence said to have been committed by him. It is the date of offence that he was in conflict with law. When a juvenile is produced before the competent authority and/or court he has not committed an offence on that date, but he was brought before the authority for the alleged offence which he has been found to have committed. Therefore, what was implicit in the 1986 Act has been made explicit in the 2000 Act. (Paras 10, 12 and 23) The definition of delinquent juvenile means a juvenile who has been found to have committed an offence. The word is employed in Section 32 of the 1986 Act is referable to a juvenile who is said to have committed an offence on the date of the occurrence. Further, the word is has been used in more than one place in Section 18 also. Often than not, an offender is arrested immediately after an offence is alleged to have been committed or sometimes even arrested on the spot. This would also show that the arrest and release on bail and custody of juveniles, the reckoning date of a juvenile is the date of an offence and not the date of production. Furthermore, Section 32 does not envisage the production of a juvenile in the court. (Paras 14 to 17) The decision rendered in Umesh Chandra was not noticed by the two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Amit Das case. Therefore, it is held that the law laid down in Umesh Chandra is the correct law and the one laid down in Amit Das cannot be said to be good law. (Paras 20 and 19) Amit Das v.

(concurring) The Juvenile Justice Act in its present form has been enacted in discharge of the obligation of our country to follow the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, 1985 also known as the Beijing Rules (the Rules). It specially refers to international law. The relevant provisions of the Rules are incorporated therein. The international treaties, covenants and conventions although may not be a part of our municipal law, the same can be referred to and followed by the courts having regard to the fact that India is a party to the said treaties. The principles of international law whenever applicable operate as a statutory implication but the legislature in the instant case held itself bound thereby and, thus, did not legislate in disregard of the constitutional provisions or the international law as also in the context of Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution. The law has to be understood, therefore, in accordance with the international law.

(Paras 39, 50, 63 and 64) Liverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. Ltd. v. M. V. Sea Success I, (2004) 9 sec 512, relied on a The purpose of the juvenile justice legislation is to provide succour to the children who were being incarcerated along with adults and were subjected to various abuses. It is not only a beneficent legislation, but also a remedial one. To bring the operations of the juvenile justice system in the country in conformity with the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, the Juvenile Justice Act came into existence in 1986. A review of the working of the then existing Acts both State and parliamentary would indicate that much b greater attention was found necessary to be given to children who may be found in situations of social maladjustment, delinquency or neglect. The justice system as available for adults could not be considered suitable for being applied to juveniles. (Paras 48, 77 and 49) Having regard to Rule 4 of the Rules, it must be borne in mind that the moral and psychological components of criminal responsibility were also one of the c factors in defining a juvenile. The first objective, therefore, is the promotion of the well-being of the juvenile and the second objective to bring about the principle of proportionality whereby and whereunder the proportionality of the reaction to the circumstances of both the offender and the offence including the victim should be safeguarded. The meaning of the expression \"juvenile\" used in a statute by reason of its very nature has to be assigned with reference to a definite date. The term \"juvenile\" must be given a definite connotation. A person d cannot be a juvenile for one purpose and an adult for other purpose. It was, having regard to the constitutional and statutory scheme, not necessary for Parliament to specifically state that the age of juvenile must be determined as on the date of commission of the offence. The same is inbuilt in the statutory scheme. The statute must be construed having regard to the scheme and the ordinary state of affairs and consequences flowing therefrom. (Para 77) e Only because the age of juvenile is to be determined in a case of dispute by the competent court or the Board in terms of Section 32 of the 1986 Act, the same would not mean that the relevant date therefor would be the one on which he is produced before the Board. If such an argument is accepted, the same would result in absurdity as, in a given case, it would be open to the police authorities not to produce him before the Board before he ceases to be juvenile. f If he is produced after he ceases to be juvenile, it may not be necessary for the Board to send him in the protective custody or release him on bail as a result whereof he would be sent to the judicial or police custody which would defeat the very purpose for which the Act had been enacted . Law cannot be applied in an uncertain position. (Para 79) The court in an appropriate case is not powerless to pass an order as is contemplated under the statute if the situation so demands but only because a 9 person is produced before the court after he attains majority either on his own volition or by reason of machinations adopted by the investigating agency, the same would not be detenninative of the fact that the said person is to be differently dealt with. Law favours strict adherence to the procedures subject to just exceptions. The right to have a fair trial strictly in terms of the Act which would include procedural safeguard is a fundamental right of the juvenile. A h proceeding against a juvenile must conform to the provisions of the Act.

STATE OF JHARKHAND 555 The statement of law made in Amit Das, (2000) 5 sec 488 that the preamble speaks of the things of post-delinquency only, is incorrect. Once the law relates to delinquent juveniles or juveniles in conflict with law, the same would mean both pre- and post-delinquency. Section 3 of the 1986 Act cannot be given effect to if it is held that the same only applied to post-delinquency of the juvenile. (Paras 84 and 85) The field covered by the Act includes a situation leading to juvenile delinquency vis-a-vis commission of an offence. In such an event he is to be provided the post-delinquency care and for the said purpose the date when delinquency took place would be the relevant date. It must, therefore, be held that the relevant date for determining the age of the juvenile would be one on which the offence has been committed and not when he is produced in court.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 556 SUPREME COURT CASES (2005) 3 sec The question before the Supreme Court was whether the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 would be applicable in a case where a proceeding was initiated under the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 and the same was a pending when the 2000Act came into force on 1-4-2001. Held: Per H.K. Sema, J. (for N. Santosh Hegde, S.N. Variava, B.P. Singh, JJ. and himself) The striking distinction between the 1986 Act and the 2000 Act is that under the 1986 Act a juvenile means a male juvenile who has not attained the age of 16 b years and a female juvenile who has not attained the age of 18 years. In the 2000 Act no distinction has been drawn between the male and female juvenile. The limit of 16 years in the 1986 Act has been raised to 18 years in the 2000 Act. (Para 28) Section 20 of the 2000 Act deals with the special provision in respect of pending cases and begins with a non obstante clause. The sentence \"notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, all proceedings in respect of a c juvenile pending in any court in any area on the date on which this Act came into force\" has great significance. The proceedings in respect of a juvenile pending in any court referred to in Section 20 of the Act are relatable to proceedings initiated before the 2000 Act came into force and which are pending when the 2000 Act came into force. The term \"any court\" would include even ordinary criminal courts. If the person was a \"juvenile\" under the 1986 Act the d proceedings would not be pending in criminal courts. They would be pending in criminal courts only if the boy had crossed 16 years or the girl had crossed 18 years. This shows that Section 20 refers to cases where a person had ceased to be a juvenile under the 1986 Act but had not yet crossed the age of 18 years then the pending case shall continue in that court as if the 2000 Act has not been passed and if the court finds that the juvenile has committed an offence it shall record such finding and instead of passing any sentence in respect of the juvenile shall e forward the juvenile to the Board which shall pass orders in respect of that juvenile. Such an interpretation does not offend Article 20(1) of the Constitution and the juvenile is not subjected to any penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted on him under the 1986 Act. (Paras 31 and 32) Thus, considering the relevant definitions and provisions, it is held that the 2000 Act would be applicable to those cases initiated and pending trial/inquiry f for the offences committed under the 1986 Act provided that the person had not completed 18 years of age as on 1-4-2001. (Paras 36, 37, 25 to 27, 29, 30, 32 and 34) Per S.B. Sinha, J. (concurring) The 2000 Act is prospective in its operation. However, the said Act has repealed the 1986 Act. It has obliterated the distinction between juvenile of different sex by reason whereof, a male juvenile would also be juvenile if he has g not crossed the age of 18. (Paras 88 and 89) In terms of the 1986 Act, a person who was not juvenile could be tried in any court. Section 20 of the Act of 2000 takes care of such a situation stating that despite the same the trial shall continue in that court as if that Act has not been passed and in the event, he is found to be guilty of commission of an offence, a finding to that effect shall be recorded in the judgment of conviction, if any, but h instead of passing any sentence in relation to the juvenile, he would be forwarded ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF JHARKHAND 557 to the Board which shall pass orders in accordance with the provisions of the Act as if he has been satisfied on inquiry that a juvenile has committed the offence. A legal fiction has, thus, been created in the said provision. A legal fiction as is well known must be given its full effect although it has its limitations. (Para 90) Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd., (2003) 2 SCC 111; rrw Signode India Ltd. v. CCE, (2004) 3 SCC 48 : (2003) 9 Scale 720; Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. State of T.N., (2004) 3 sec 1, relied on Maruti Udyog Ltd. v. Ram Lal, (2005) 2 SCC 638, referred to Thus, by reason of legal fiction, a person, although not a juvenile, has to be treated to be one by the Board for the purpose of sentencing which takes care of a situation that the person although not a juvenile in terms of the 1986 Act but still would be treated as such under the 2000 Act for the said limited purpose. (Para 92) The Act provides for beneficent consequences and, thus, it is required to be construed liberally. The Supreme Court is not oblivious of the proposition that a beneficent legislation should not be construed so liberally so as to bring within its fore a person who does not answer the statutory scheme. However, as would appear from the provisions of the Act of 2000 that the scheme of the 2000 Act is such that such a construction is possible. The same would also be evident from Section 64 which deals with a case where a person has been undergoing a sentence but if he is a juvenile within the meaning of the 2000 Act having not crossed the age of 18, the provisions thereof would apply as if he had been ordered by the Board to be sent to a special home or an institution, as the case may be. (Para 94) Deepal Girishbhai Soni v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., (2004) 5 SCC 385 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 1623, relied on Thus, by reason of the provisions of the said Act of 2000, the protection granted to a juvenile has only been extended but such extension is not absolute but only a limited one. It would apply strictly when the conditions precedent therefor as contained in Section 20 or Section 64 are fulfilled. Section 20 of the Act of 2000 would be applicable when a person is below the age of 18 years as on 1-4-2001. For the purpose of attracting Section 20 of the Act, it must be established that: (i) on the date of coming into force the proceedings in which the petitioner was accused were pending; and (ii) on that day he was below the age of 18 years. The provisions of the Act repeatedly refer to the words \"juvenile\" or \"delinquent juveniles\" specifically. This appears to be the object of the Act and for ascertaining the true intent of Parliament, the rule of purposive construction must be adopted. The purpose of the Act would stand defeated if a child continues to be in the company of an adult. Thus, the Act of 2000 intends to give the protection only to a juvenile within the meaning of the said Act and not an adult. In other words, although it would apply to a person who is still a juvenile having not attained the age of 18 years but shall not apply to a person who has already attained the age of 18 years on the date of coming into force thereof or who had not attained the age of 18 years on the date of commission of the offence but has since ceased to be a juvenile. (Para 95) The embargo of giving a retrospective effect to a statute arises only when it takes away vested right of a person. By reasons of Section 20 of the Act no vested right in a person has been taken away, but thereby only an additional protection has been provided to a juvenile.

(Paras 104 and 105) b Singh, G.P.: Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 9th Edn., 2004, p. 733, relied on It is not intended to maintain that no other view is possible. But in a case of this nature where an additional protection had been granted pursuant to or in furtherance of the international treaties and keeping in view the experience which had been gathered by Parliament after coming into force of the 1986 Act, it should be read in such a fashion so that the extended benefit can be granted even to the juvenile under the 2000 Act. Furthermore, sub-section (2) of Section c 69 provides that all proceedings shall be deemed to have been held under the new Act.

Singh, JJ. and himself)-Leave granted. 2. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 10-9-2001 passed by the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi in Criminal Revision No. 98 of 2001. 3. Briefly stated the facts giving rise to the filing of the present appeal are as follows: First infonnation report was lodged before the police in Bokaro city registered as PS Case No. 1 of 1999 dated 1-1-1999 for the offence under Sections 364-A, 302/201 IPC read with Section 120-B IPC to the effect that a b on 31-12-1998 the appellant was alleged as one of the conspirators to have caused the death of the deceased by poisoning. On the basis of the FIR the appellant was arrested and produced before the CJM, Chas on 22-11-1999. c On production, the learned CJM assessed the age of the appellant to be around 18 years old. On 28-2-2000, a petition was filed on behalf of the appellant claiming that he was a minor on the date of occurrence i.e. 31-12-1998, whereupon the learned CJM transmitted the case to the Juvenile Court. The appellant was produced in the Juvenile Court on 3-3-2000. On his production the Juvenile Court assessed the age of the appellant by d appearance to be between 15 and 16 years and directed the Civil Surgeon to constitute a Medical Board for the purpose of assessing the age of the appellant by scientific examination and submit a report. No such Medical Board was constituted. Thus, the learned ACJM asked the parties to adduce evidence and on examining the school-leaving certificate and marksheet of the Central Board of Secondary Education came to the finding that the e appellant was below 16 years of age as on 3 1-12-1998 taking the date of birth of the appellant as 18-12-1983 recorded in the aforesaid certificate. The appellant was then released on bail. 4. Aggrieved thereby the informant filed an appeal before the 1st Additional Sessions Judge, who after referring to the judgment of this Court rendered in Amit Das v. State of Bihar 1 disposed of the appeal on 19-2-2001 f holding that the Juvenile Court had erred in not taking note of the fact that the date of production before the Juvenile Court was the date relevant for deciding whether the appellant was juvenile or not for the purpose of trial and directed a fresh inquiry to assess the age of the appellant. Aggrieved thereby the appellant moved the High Court by filing criminal revision petition. The High Court while disposing of the revision has followed the g decision rendered by this Court in Amit Das 1 and held that reckoning date is the date of production of the accused before the court and not the date of the occurrence of the offence. 5. The High Court held that for determining the age of juvenile, the provisions of the 1986 Act would apply and not the 2000 Act.

STATE OF JHARKHAND (Serna, J.) 563 Court, however, took the view that the date of birth, as recorded in the school and the school certificate, should be the best evidence for fixing the age of the appellant. The High Court was also of the view that any other evidence in proof of age would be of much inferior quality. As the enquiry is pending, we need not delve into this question. 6. Having noticed the conflicting views in Amit Das v. State of Bihar 1 and Umesh Chandra v. State of Rajasthan 2 this matter has been referred to the Constitution Bench by an order dated 7-2-2003t. It reads: \"1. The High Court in its impugned judgment has relied on a two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Amit Das v. State of Bihar 1• The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that in Amit Das 1 the decision of this Court in Umesh Chandra v. State of Rajasthan 2 was not considered. The point arising is one of frequent recurrence and view of the law taken in this case is likely to have a bearing on the new Act, that is, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 also, the matter deserves to be heard by the Constitution Bench of this Court. Be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India, soliciting directions.\" This is how the matter has been placed before us. 7. The dual questions which require authoritative decision are: (a) Whether the date of occurrence will be the reckoning date for determining the age of the alleged off ender as juvenile offender or the date when he is produced in the court/competent authority. (b) Whether the Act of 2000 will be applicable in the case a proceeding is initiated under the 1986 Act and pending when the Act of 2000 was enforced with effect from 1-4-2001. Question (a) Whether the date of occurrence will be the reckoning date for determining the age of the alleged offender as juvenile offender or the date when he is produced in the court/competent authority 8. Mr Mishra submits that the decision in Umesh Chandra 2 rendered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court has laid down the correct law and a two- Judge Bench decision in Amit Das 1 cannot be said to have laid down a correct law. Mr Mishra also submits that the decision in Amit Das 1 has not noticed the decision of a three-Judge Bench in Umesh Chandra 2 • Mr Mishra also referred to the aims and objects of the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the 1986 Act) and submits that the whole object is to reform and rehabilitate the juvenile for the offence he is alleged to have committed and if the date of offence is not taken for reckoning the age of the juvenile, the purpose of the Act itself would be defeated. In this connection, he has referred to Sections 18, 20, 26 and 32 of the Act.

We may at this stage notice the preamble as well as object of the 1986 Act: \"An Act to provide for the care, protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of neglected or delinquent juveniles and for the adjudication of b certain matters relating to, and disposition of, delinquent juveniles. Be it enacted by Parliament in the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of India as follows: Prefatory Note - Statement of Objects and Reasons.-A review of the working of the existing children Acts would indicate that much greater attention is required to be given to children who may be found in situations c of social maladjustment, delinquency or neglect. The justice system as available for adults is not considered suitable for being applied to juveniles. It is also necessary that a uniform juvenile justice system should be available throughout the country which should make adequate provision for dealing with all aspects in the changing social, cultural and economic situation in the country. There is also need for larger involvement of informal systems and community-based welfare agencies in the care, protection, treatment, d development and rehabilitation of such juveniles. 2. In this context, the proposed legislation aims at achieving the following objectives: (i) to lay down a uniform legal framework for juvenile justice in the country so as to ensure that no child under any circumstances is lodged in jail or police lock-up. This is being ensured by establishing Juvenile e Welfare Boards and Juvenile Courts; (ii) to provide for a specialised approach towards the prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency in its full range in keeping with the developmental needs of the child found in any situation of social maladjustment; (iii) to spell out the machinery and infrastructure required for the f care, protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of various categories of children coming within the purview of the juvenile justice system. This is proposed to be achieved by establishing observation homes, juvenile homes for neglected juveniles and special homes for delinquent juveniles; (iv) to establish norms and standards for the administration of juvenile justice in terms of investigation and prosecution, adjudication 9 and disposition, and care, treatment and rehabilitation; (v) to develop appropriate linkages and coordination between the formal system of juvenile justice and voluntary agencies engaged in the welfare of neglected or socially maladjusted children and to specifically define the areas of their responsibilities and roles; (vi) to constitute special offences in relation to juveniles and h provide for punishments therefor; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF JHARKHAND (Serna, J.) 565 (vii) to bring the operation of the juvenile justice system in the country in conformity with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice. 3. As its various provisions come into force in different parts of the country they would replace the corresponding laws on the subject such as the Children Act, 1960 and other State enactments on the subject.\" 10. Thus, the whole object of the Act is to provide for the care, protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of neglected or b delinquent juveniles. It is a beneficial legislation aimed at making available the benefit of the Act to the neglected or delinquent juveniles. It is settled law that the interpretation of the statute of beneficial legislation must be to advance the cause of legislation for the benefit of whom it is made and not to frustrate the intendment of the legislation. 11. We may also, at this stage, notice the definition of delinquent c juvenile. Clause ( e) of Section 2 of the 1986 Act defines the delinquent juvenile as: \"2. (e) ' delinquent juvenile' means a juvenile who has been found to have committed an offence;\" 12. Clause (l) of Section 2 of the 2000 Act defines \"juvenile in conflict with law\" as meaning a juvenile who is alleged to have committed an d offence . The notable distinction between the definitions of the 1986 Act and the 2000 Act is that in the 1986 Act \"juvenile in conflict with law\" is absent. The definition of delinquent juvenile in the 1986 Act as noticed above is referable to an offence said to have been committed by him. It is the date of offence that he was in conflict with law. When a juvenile is produced before the competent authority and/or court he has not committed an offence on that e date, but he was brought before the authority for the alleged offence which he has been found to have committed. In our view, therefore, what was implicit in the 1986 Act has been made explicit in the 2000 Act. f g 13. Section 32 of the 1986 Act deals with the presumption and detennination of age, which reads: \"32. Presumption and determination of age.-(l) Where it appears to a competent authority that a person brought before it under any of the provisions of this Act (otherwise than for the purpose of giving evidence) is a juvenile, the competent authority shall make due inquiry as to the age of that person and for that purpose shall take such evidence as may be necessary and shall record a finding whether the person is a juvenile or not, stating his age as nearly as may be. (2) No order of a competent authority shall be deemed to have become invalid merely by any subsequent proof that the person in respect of whom the order has been made is not a juvenile, and the age recorded by the competent authority to be the age of the person so brought before it shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be the true age of that person.\" 14. Mr Sharan stressed heavily on the word is used in two places of the h section and contended that the word is suggests that for determination of age of juvenile the date of production would be the reckoning date as the inquiry ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

We are unable to countenance this submission. We have already noticed that the definition of delinquent juvenile means a juvenile a who has been found to have committed an offence. The word is employed in Section 32 is referable to a juvenile who is said to have committed an offence on the date of the occurrence. We may also notice the provisions of Section 18 of the 1986 Act. Section 18 provides for bail and custody of juveniles. It reads: \"18. Bail and custody of juveniles.-(!) When any person accused of a b bailable or non-bailable offence and apparently a juvenile is arrested or detained or appears or is brought before a Juvenile Court, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), or in any other law for the time being in force, be released on bail with or without surety but he shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that the release is likely to bring him into association with any known criminal or expose him to moral danger or that c his release would defeat the ends of justice. (2) When such person having been arrested is not released on bail under sub-section (1) by the officer in charge of the police station, such officer shall cause him to be kept in an observation home or a place of safety in the prescribed manner (but not in a police station or jail) until he can be brought before a Juvenile Court. d (3) When such person is not released on bail under sub-section (1) by the Juvenile Court it shall, instead of committing him to prison, make an order sending him to an observation home or a place of safety for such period during the pendency of the inquiry regarding him as may be specified in the order.\" 15. It will be noticed that the word is has been used in more than one e place in this section also. Often than not, an offender is arrested immediately after an offence is alleged to have been committed or sometimes even arrested on the spot. 16. This would also show that the arrest and release on bail and custody of juveniles, the reckoning date of a juvenile is the date of an offence and not the date of production. f 17. Furthermore, Section 32 of the Act heavily relied upon by the counsel for the respondent does not envisage the production of a juvenile in the court. 18. We may also usefully refer to Sections 3 and 26 of the 1986 Act. Sections 3 and 26 of the Act read: \"3. Continuation of inquiry in respect of juvenile who has ceased to be a juvenile .-Where an inquiry has been initiated against a juvenile and during g the course of such inquiry the juvenile ceases to be such, then, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force, the inquiry may be continued and orders may be made in respect of such person as if such person had continued to be a juvenile. * * * 26.

The legislative intendment underlying Sections 3 and 26 read with the preamble, aims and objects of the Act is clearly discernible. A conjoint reading of the sections, preamble, aims and objects of the Act leaves no manner of doubt that the legislature intended to provide protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of neglected or delinquent juveniles and for the adjudication thereof. Interpretation of Sections 3 and 26 of the Act are no more res integra. Sections 3 and 26 of the 1986 Act as quoted above are in pari materia with Sections 3 and 26 of the Rajasthan Children Act, 1970 (Raj Act 16 of 1970). A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Umesh Chandra 2 after considering the preamble, aims and objects and Sections 3 and 26 of the Rajasthan Act, held that the Act being a piece of social legislation is meant for the protection of infants who commit criminal offences and, therefore, such provisions should be liberally and meaningfully construed so as to advance the object of the Act. This Court then said in para 28 at SCC p. 21 0: \"28. As regards the general applicability of the Act, we are clearly of the view that the relevant date for the applicability of the Act is the date on which the offence takes place. Children Act was enacted to protect young children from the consequences of their criminal acts on the footing that their mind at that age could not be said to be mature for imputing mens rea as in the case of an adult. This being the intendment of the Act, a clear finding has to be recorded that the relevant date for applicability of the Act is the date on which the offence takes place. It is quite possible that by the time the case comes up for trial, growing in age being an involuntary factor, the child may have ceased to be a child. Therefore, Sections 3 and 26 became necessary. Both the sections clearly point in the direction of the relevant date for the applicability of the Act as the date of occurrence. We are clearly of the view that the relevant date for applicability of the Act so far as age of the accused, who claims to be a child, is concerned, is the date of the occurrence and not the date of the trial.\" (emphasis supplied) 20. As already noticed the decision rendered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Umesh Chandra 2 was not noticed by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Amit Das 1• We are clearly of the view that the law laid down in Umesh Chandra 2 is the correct law and that the decision rendered by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Amit Das 1 cannot be said to have laid down a good law. We, accordingly, hold that the law laid down by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Umesh Chandra 2 is the correct law. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On this point, we have heard Mr P.S. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, Ms Maharukh Adenwala, counsel for the intervener and Mr Amarendera Sharan, learned ASG for the State of Jharkhand. In fact counsel for the intervener has adopted the arguments of Mr Mishra. Mr Mishra would submit that any proceeding against any person pending under the 1986 Act b would be covered by the 2000 Act and would extend the benefit of being a juvenile as defined under the 2000 Act, if at the time of the commission of the offence he was below the age of 18 years. To buttress his point counsel heavily relied upon the provisions contained in Section 20 of the Act and Rules 61 and 62 framed by the Central Government. Per contra Mr Sharan, counsel for the respondent would contend that the 1986 Act has been c repealed by Section 69( 1) of the 2000 Act and, therefore, the provisions of the 2000 Act would not be extended to a case/inquiry initiated and pending under the provisions of the 1986 Act, the Act of 2000 being not retrospective. 22. To answer the aforesaid question, it would be necessary to make a quick survey of the definitions and sections of the 2000 Act, relevant for the d purpose of disposing of the case at hand. 23. As stated hereinabove the whole object of the Acts is to provide for the care, protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of juveniles. The Acts being benevolent legislations, an interpretation must be given which would advance the cause of the legislation i.e. to give benefit to the juveniles. 24. The 1986 Act was holding the field till it was eclipsed by the e emergence of the 2000 Act w.e.f. 1-4-2001, the date on which the said Act came into force by the notification dated 28-2-2001 in the Official Gazette issued by the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (3) of Section 1 of the Act. Section 69(1) of the Act repealed the 1986 Act. It reads: \"69. Repeal and savings.-(l) The Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 (53 of f 1986) is hereby repealed. (2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or any action taken under the said Act shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act.\" (emphasis supplied) 25. Sub-section (2) postulates that anything done or any action taken under the 1986 Act shall be deemed to have been done or taken under the g corresponding provisions of the 2000 Act. Thus, although the 1986 Act was repealed by the 2000 Act, anything done or any action taken under the 1986 Act is saved by sub-section (2), as if the action has been taken under the provisions of the 2000 Act. h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h PRATAP SINGH v. STATE OF JHARKHAND (Sema, J.) 569 26. Section 20 on which reliance has been placed heavily by the counsel for the appellant deals with the special provision in respect of pending cases. It reads: \"20. Special provision in respect of pending cases.-Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, all proceedings in respect of a juvenile pending in any court in any area on the date on which this Act comes into force in that area, shall be continued in that court as if this Act had not been passed and if the court finds that the juvenile has committed an offence, it shall record such finding and instead of passing any sentence in respect of the juvenile, forward the juvenile to the Board which shall pass orders in respect of that juvenile in accordance with the provisions of this Act as if it had been satisfied on inquiry under this Act that a juvenile has committed the offence.\" 27. The striking distinction between the 1986 Act and the 2000 Act is with regard to the definition of juvenile. Section 2(h) of the 1986 Act defines juvenile as under: \"2. (h) 'juvenile' means a boy who has not attained the age of sixteen years or a girl who has not attained the age of eighteen years;\" Section 2(k) of the 2000 Act defines juvenile as under: \"2. (k) 'juvenile' or 'child' means a person who has not completed eighteenth year of age;\" 28. Thus, the striking distinction between the 1986 Act and the 2000 Act is that under the 1986 Act a juvenile means a male juvenile who has not attained the age of 16 years and a female juvenile who has not attained the age of 18 years. In the 2000 Act no distinction has been drawn between the male and female juvenile . The limit of 16 years in the 1986 Act has been raised to 18 years in the 2000 Act. In the 2000 Act wherever the word \"juvenile\" appears the same will now have to be taken to mean a person who has not completed 18 years of age. 29. Section 3 provides as follows: \"3. Continuation of inquiry in respect of juvenile who has ceased to be a juvenile .-Where an inquiry has been initiated against a juvenile in conflict with law or a child in need of care and protection and during the course of such inquiry the juvenile or the child ceases to be such, then, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force, the inquiry may be continued and orders may be made in respect of such person as if such person had continued to be a juvenile or a child.\" Thus, even where an inquiry has been initiated and the juvenile ceases to be a juvenile i.e. crosses the age of 18 years, the inquiry must be continued and orders made in respect of such person as if such person had continued to be a juvenile. 30. Similarly, under Section 64 where a juvenile is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment at the commencement of the 2000 Act he would, in lieu of undergoing such sentence, be sent to a special home or be kept in a fit institution. These provisions show that even in cases where a mere inquiry ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 570 SUPREME COURT CASES (2005) 3 sec has commenced or even where a juvenile has been sentenced the provisions of the 2000Act would apply. Therefore, Section 20 is to be appreciated in the context of the aforesaid provisions. a 31. Section 20 of the Act as quoted above deals with the special provision in respect of pending cases and begins with a non obstante clause. The sentence \"notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, all proceedings in respect of a juvenile pending in any court in any area on the date on which this Act came into force\" has great significance. The proceedings in respect of a juvenile pending in any court referred to in Section 20 of the Act are b relatable to proceedings initiated before the 2000 Act came into force and which are pending when the 2000 Act came into force. The term \"any court\" would include even ordinary criminal courts. If the person was a \"juvenile\" under the 1986 Act the proceedings would not be pending in criminal courts. They would be pending in criminal courts only if the boy had crossed 16 years or the girl had crossed 18 years. This shows that Section 20 refers to c cases where a person had ceased to be a juvenile under the 1986 Act but had not yet crossed the age of 18 years then the pending case shall continue in that court as if the 2000 Act has not been passed and if the court finds that the juvenile has committed an offence, it shall record such finding and instead of passing any sentence in respect of the juvenile, shall forward the juvenile to the Board which shall pass orders in respect of that juvenile. d 32. In this connection it is pertinent to note that Section 16 of the 2000 Act is identical to Section 22 of the 1986 Act. Similarly Section 15 of the 2000 Act is in pari materia with Section 21 of the 1986 Act. Thus, such an interpretation does not offend Article 20(1) of the Constitution and the juvenile is not subjected to any penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted on him under the 1986 Act. e 33. Mr Mishra placed reliance on Rules 61 and 62 framed by the Central Govemmenttt. According to him, particularly Rule 62 of the Rules covers the pending cases and the appellant is entitled to the benefit of Rule 62. Rule 62 reads: \"62. Pending cases.-(1) No juvenile in conflict with law or a child f shall be denied the benefits of the Act and the rules made thereunder. (2) All pending cases which have not received a finality shall be dealt with and disposed of in terms of the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder. (3) Any juvenile in conflict with law, or a child shall be given the benefits under sub-rule (1), and it is hereby clarified that such benefits shall be made available not only to those accused who was juvenile or a child at 9 the time of commission of an offence, but also to those who ceased to be a juvenile or a child during the pendency of any enquiry or trial.

This rule also indicates that the intention of the legislature was that the provisions of the 2000 Act were to apply to pending cases provided, on 1-4-2001 i.e. the date on which the 2000 Act came into force, the person was a \"juvenile\" within the meaning of the term as defined in the 2000 Act i.e. he/she had not crossed 18 years of age. 35. Mr Mishra referred to the decision of the two-Judge Bench of this Court in Upendra Kumar v. State of Bihar 3 wherein this Court referred to the earlier decisions of this Court rendered in Bhola Bhagat v. State of Bihar4, Gopinath Ghosh v. State of W.B.5, Bhoop Ram v. State of U.P.6 and Pradeep Kumar v. State of U.P.7 where this Court came to the conclusion that the accused who were juveniles could not be denied the benefit of the provisions of the Act then in force. 36. We, therefore, hold that the provisions of the 2000 Act would be applicable to those cases initiated and pending trial/inquiry for the offences committed under the 1986 Act provided that the person had not completed 18 years of age as on 1-4-2001. 37. The net result is: (a) The reckoning date for the detennination of the age of the juvenile is the date of the offence and not the date when he is produced before the authority or in the court. (b) The 2000 Act would be applicable in a pending proceeding in any court/authority initiated under the 1986 Act and is pending when the 2000 Act came into force and the person had not completed 18 years of age as on 1-4-2001. 38.

The important role that a constructive social policy for juveniles has to play has been pointed out in Rules 1.1 to 1.13 inter alia in the matter of prevention of juvenile crime and delinquency. Rule 1.4 defines a juvenile justice as an integral part of the national development process of each country, within a comprehensive framework of social justice from all juveniles, and, thus, at the same time, contributing to the protection of the young and maintenance of a peaceful order in the society. While Rule 1.6 refers to the necessity of the juvenile justice system being systematically developed and coordinated with a view to improving and sustaining the b competence of personnel involved in the services including their methods, approaches and attitudes, Rule 1.5 seeks to take account of existing conditions in member States which would cause the manner of implementation of particular rules necessarily to be different from the manner adopted in other States. Rule 2.1 provides for application of the Rules without distinction of any kind. Rule 2.2 provides for the definitions c which are as follows: \"(a) A juvenile is a child or young person who, under the respective legal systems, may be dealt with for an offence in a manner which is different from an adult. (b) An offence is any behaviour (act or omission) that is punishable by law under the respective legal systems. d ( c) A juvenile offender is a child or young person who is alleged to have committed or who has been found to have committed an offence .\" 41. Rule 2.3 inter alia provides for making a set of laws, rules and provisions specifically applicable to juvenile offenders and institutions and bodies entrusted with the functions of the administration of juvenile justice e and designed: \"(a) to meet the varying needs of juvenile offenders, while protecting their basic rights; (b) to meet the needs of society; (c) to implement the following Rules thoroughly and fairly.\" 42. The age of a juvenile is to be determined by the member countries f having regard to their legal system, thus fully respecting the economic, social, political, cultural and legal systems. This has made a wide variety of ages coming under the definition of \"juvenile\", ranging from 7 years to 18 years or above. Rule 3 provides for extension of the Rules covering (a) status offences; (b) juvenile welfare and care proceedings; and (c) proceedings dealing with young adult offenders, depending of course on each given age- 9 limit. Rule 4 provides that the minimum age of criminal responsibility should not be fixed at too low an age level bearing in mind the facts of emotional, mental and intellectual maturity.

Objects ofjuvenilejustice legislation e 48. The purpose of the juvenile justice legislation is to provide succour to the children who were being incarcerated along with adults and were subjected to various abuses. It would be in the fitness of things that appreciation of the very object and purpose of the legislation is seen with a f clear understanding which sought to bring relief to juvenile delinquents. 49. The problem of juvenile justice is, no doubt, one of tragic human interest so much so in fact that it is not confined to this country alone but cuts across national boundaries. In 1966 at the Second United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders at London this issue was discussed and several therapeutic recommendations were adopted. To g bring the operations of the juvenile justice system in the country in conformity with the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, the Juvenile Justice Act came into existence in 1986. A review of the working of the then existing Acts both State and parliamentary would indicate that much greater attention was found necessary to be given to children who may be found in situations of social maladjustment, h delinquency or neglect.

There is also need for larger involvement of informal system and community-based welfare agencies in the care, protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of such juveniles. 50. The provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as \"the 1986 Act\") and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (56 of 2000) (hereinafter referred to as \"the 2000 Act\") are required to be construed having regard to the aforementioned Minimum Standards as the same are specifically referred to therein. 51. The Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 is aimed at achieving the following objects: (i) To lay down a uniform legal framework for juvenile justice in the country so as to ensure that no child under any circumstances is lodged in jail or police lock-up. This is being ensured by establishing Juvenile Welfare Boards and Juvenile Courts. (ii) To provide for a specialised approach towards the prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency in its full range in keeping with the development needs of the child found in any situation of social maladjustment. (iii) To spell out the machinery and infrastructure required for the care, protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of various categories of children coming within the purview of the juvenile justice system. This is proposed to be achieved by establishing observation homes, juvenile homes for neglected juveniles and special homes for delinquent juveniles. (iv) To establish norms and standards for the administration of juvenile justice in terms of investigation and prosecution, adjudication and disposition and care, treatment and rehabilitation. (v) To develop appropriate linkages and coordination between the formal system of juvenile justice and voluntary agencies engaged in the welfare of neglected or socially maladjusted children and to specifically define the areas of their responsibilities and roles. (vi) To constitute special offences in relation to juveniles and provide for punishment therefor. (vii) To bring the operation of the juvenile justice system in the country in conformity with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice. 52. The various provisions of the 1986 Act provide for a scheme of uniform juvenile justice system in the country so that a juvenile may not have to be lodged in jail or police lock-up as well as for prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency for care, protection, etc. 53.

Chapter II of the Act speaks of competent authorities and a institutions for juveniles such as Juvenile Welfare Boards, Juvenile Courts, juvenile homes, special homes, observation homes and after-care organisations. Chapter III makes provision for neglected juveniles. Section 17 makes provision for uncontrollable juveniles. Chapter IV deals with delinquent juveniles. Sections 18 to 26 provide for bail and custody of juveniles, accused of a bailable or non-bailable offence, the manner of b dealing with them and the orders that may be passed regarding or against delinquent juveniles. Proceedings as laid down in Chapter VIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure are not competent against a juvenile. A juvenile and a person who is not a juvenile cannot be jointly tried. No disqualification attaches to conviction of a juvenile for any offence under any law. Special provisions are contained in Section 26 as regards the proceedings in respect c of juveniles pending in any court on the date of the coming into force of the Act. Chapter V (Sections 27 to 40) lay down the procedure of competent authorities generally under the Act and appeals and revisions from orders of such authorities. Chapter VI (Sections 41 to 45) provides for special offences in respect of juveniles. Chapter VII (Sections 46 to 63) contains miscellaneous provisions. d 54. Section 32 of the 1986 Act mandates the competent authority to hold enquiry as to the age of the delinquent brought before it. 55. The 1986 Act has been repealed and replaced by the 2000 Act. 56. The 2000 Act has brought about certain changes vis-a-vis the 1986 Act. It has obliterated the distinction between a male juvenile and female juvenile. In contrast with the definition of delinquent juvenile in the 1986 Act e who was found guilty of commission of an offence, a juvenile in conflict with law is defined in the 2000 Act to mean a person who is of below 18 years of age and is alleged to have committed an offence. Section 3 provides for continuation of inquiry in respect of a juvenile who has ceased to be a juvenile. f 57. By reason of the aforementioned provisions a legal fiction has been created to treat a juvenile who has ceased to be a juvenile as a person as if he had continued to be a juvenile. Chapter II provides for constitution of a Juvenile Justice Board. Its power had been outlined in Section 6. Section 7 mandates that a Magistrate before whom a juvenile is produced must without any delay record his opinion, and if it is found that a person brought before g him is a juvenile, he shall record the same and forward him with the record of the proceeding to the competent authority having jurisdiction over the proceeding.

Section 14 provides for holding of an inquiry by the Board regarding a juvenile within a period of four months.

Sections 4 to 28 occur in Chapter II which deal with juvenile in a conflict with law and Section 64 occurs in Chapter V dealing with miscellaneous provisions. It is interesting to note that all the provisions occurring in Chapter II or Section 20 do not use the expression juvenile in conflict with law whereas Section 64 specifically uses that expression. 60. Section 20 of the Act permits continuation of proceedings of a Juvenile Court in any area on the date on which the Act came into force by b providing it shall record such finding and instead of passing any sentence in respect of that juvenile, shall forward him to the Board which shall pass orders in respect of that juvenile in accordance with the provisions of this Act as if it had been satisfied on inquiry under this Act that a juvenile had committed the offence. c 61. Section 68 provides for rule-making power of the State Government. No State unfortunately has framed any rule in exercise thereof. The Central Government, however, in purported exercise of its power under Section 70 of the Act published the principles which are fundamental to the development of strategies, interpretation and implementation of the Act of 2000 and the d model rules which the State Governments are required to frame. Rule 61 of the said Model Rules is as under: \"61. Temporary application of Model Rules.-It is hereby declared that until the new rules are framed by the State Government concerned under Section 68 of the Act, these Rules shall mutatis mutandis apply in that State.\" 62. Rule 62 deals with pending cases and sub-rule (3) thereof reads as e under: \"62. (3) ... it is hereby clarified that such benefits shall be made available not only to those accused who was juvenile or a child at the time of commission of an offence, but also to those who ceased to be a juvenile or a child during the pendency of any enquiry or trial.\" 63. The legislation relating to juvenile justice should be construed as a f step for resolution of the problem of juvenile justice which was one of tragic human interest which cuts across national boundaries. The said Act has not only to be read in terms of the Rules but also the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Protection of Juveniles. International law g 64. The Juvenile Justice Act specially refers to international law. The relevant provisions of the Rules are incorporated therein. The international treaties, covenants and conventions although may not be a part of our municipal law, the same can be referred to and followed by the courts having regard to the fact that India is a party to the said treaties.

It is now trite that any violation of human rights would be looked down upon. Some provisions of the international law although may not be a part of our municipal law but the courts are not hesitant in referring thereto so as to find new rights in the context of the Constitution. Constitution of India and other ongoing statutes have been read consistently with the rules of international law. Constitution is a source of, and not an exercise of, legislative power. The principles of international law whenever applicable operate as a statutory implication but the legislature in the instant case held itself bound thereby and, thus, did not legislate in disregard of the constitutional provisions or the international law as also in the context of Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution. The law has to be understood, therefore, in accordance with the international law. Part III of our Constitution protects substantive as well as procedural rights. Implications which arise therefrom must effectively be protected by the judiciary. A contextual meaning to the statute is required to be assigned having regard to the constitutional as well as international law operating in the field. (See Liverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. Ltd. v. M. V. Sea Success 18 .) 65. In R. v. Secy. of State for the Home Deptt., exp Daly 9 Lord Stein observed that in the law context is everything in the following terms: \"28. The differences in approach between the traditional grounds of review and the proportionality approach may therefore sometimes yield different results. It is therefore important that cases involving convention rights must be analysed in the correct way. This does not mean that there has been a shift to merits review. On the contrary, as Professor Jowell (2000) PL 671, 681 has pointed out the respective roles of judges and administrators are fundamentally distinct and will remain so. To this extent the general tenor of the observations in Mahmood 10 are correct. And Laws, L.J. rightly emphasized in Mahmood 10, at p. 847, para 18, 'that the intensity of review in a public law case will depend on the subject-matter in hand'. That is so even in cases involving convention rights. In law context is everything.\" 66. Constitution of India and the juvenile justice legislations must necessarily be understood in the context of the present-day scenario and having regard to the international treaties and conventions. Our Constitution takes note of the institutions of the world community which had been created. Some legal instruments that have declared the human rights and fundamental freedoms of humanity had been adopted but over the time even new rights had been found in several countries, as for example, South Africa (S. v. Makwanyane 11), Canada [Public Service Employee Relations Act s (2004) 9 sec 512 9 (2001) 2 AC 532: (2001) 3 All ER 433 (HL) 10 R . v. Secy. of State for the Home Deptt., exp.

Minister of Immigration 14 (NZLR at p. 266)], United a Kingdom (Pratt v. Attorney General for Jamaica 15) and United States (Atkins v. Virginia 16 and Lawrence v. Texas 17). New ideas had occupied the human mind as regards protection of human rights. (See Hamdi v. Rumsfield 18, Russel v. Bush 19 and Rums.field v. Padila 20 .) 67. Now, the Constitution speaks not only \"to the people of India who made it and accepted it for their governance but also to the international b community as the basic law of the Indian nation which is a member of that community\". Inevitably, its meaning is influenced by the legal context in which it must operate. 68. The legal instruments that have declared legal rights and fundamental freedoms, founded in the nations of human dignity and Charter of the United Nations were not known earlier which is manifest today. (Charter of the c United Nations, signed at San Francisco on 26-6-1945, preamble.) Political, social and economic development can throw light on the meaning of the Constitution. 69. In Lawrence 17 Kennedy, J., for the Supreme Court, after references to international human rights law, concluded: d \"Had those who drew and ratified the due process clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution e endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.\" The questions, therefore, in our opinion, should be determined having regard to the aforementioned principles.

STATE OF JHARKHAND (Sinha, J.) 581 proceedings, the purpose whereof is to assure swift and certain adjudication at all phases of the proceeding. (See Frank C., In re21 .) 71. A similar issue was examined by the Supreme Court of California in Alfredo v. Superior Court 22 wherein a juvenile sought habeas corpus to obtain release. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment provides the authority for the promptness required for a juvenile hearing. It was further held that a minor must be released upon expiration of the statutory time-limit for detention due to the juvenile's interest in freedom from institutional restraints. The Court implied that the time allowed to have the hearing shall stand extended once the juvenile is released, and that dismissal is not the only necessary remedy . 72. In Robinson v. Texas 23 the Texas Court of Appeals held that in calculating the time for a speedy trial continuances should not be included. In that case, the court found that continuances based on reset forms signed by the appellant's attorney were excludable from the statutory time-limits for a speedy trial. 73. In Illinois v. Stufflebean 24 the Appellate Court of Illinois held that the remedy for detention of a juvenile beyond the statutory limit was immediate release, not dismissal. In Stufflebean 24 the court denied a probationer's request for dismissal based on incarceration exceeding statutory limits. Questions 74. The questions which arise for consideration in this reference are: (i) What would be the reckoning date in determining the age of the offender viz. date when produced in a court, as has been held by this Court in Amit Das v. State of Bihar 1 or the date on which the offence was committed as has been held in Umesh Chandra v. State of Rajasthan2? (ii) Whether the 2000 Act will be applicable in cases which were pending before the enforcement thereof? Re: Question (i) 75. We have noticed hereinbefore that the decisions in Umesh Chandra 2 and Amit Das 1 are in conflict with each other. Whereas in Umesh Chandra 2 a clear finding has been recorded by this Court that the relevant date for applicability of the Act is the date on which the offence takes place; in Amit Das 1 Lahoti, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) speaking for a Division Bench held that Section 8(a) of the Act and the scheme as also the phraseology employed by Parliament in drafting the Act suggests that the relevant date for finding out the age of a juvenile is the date when he is produced before the Board. It was observed that indisputably the definition of juvenile or any other provisions contained in the Act does not specifically 21 70 NY 2d 408 22 849 P 2d 1330 (Cal 1993) 23 707 SW 2d 47 24 392 NE 2d 414 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 582 SUPREME COURT CASES (2005) 3 sec provide the date by reference to which a crime has to be determined so as to find out whether he is or she is a juvenile or not. 76. In support of the view taken in Amit Das 1 the learned Additional a Solicitor General appearing for the respondent submitted that the Act aims at protection of a juvenile in the sense that he is to be kept in the protective custody and dealt with separately by not sending him to prison or police lock-up which is possible to be directed only when a juvenile is arrested or produced in court and not prior thereto. Similarly, on conviction, he cannot be sentenced and may be directed to be housed in a protective home and, b thus, the relevant date would be the one on which the delinquent juvenile is produced before the Board. 77. This argument cannot be accepted for more than one reason. The said Act is not only a beneficent legislation, but also a remedial one. The Act aims at grant of care, protection and rehabilitation of a juvenile vis-a-vis the adult criminals. Having regard to Rule 4 of the United Nations Standard Minimum c Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, it must also be borne in mind that the moral and psychological components of criminal responsibility were also one of the factors in defining a juvenile. The first objective, therefore, is the promotion of the well-being of the juvenile and the second objective to bring about the principle of proportionality whereby and whereunder the proportionality of the reaction to the circumstances of both d the offender and the offence including the victim should be safeguarded. In essence, Rule 5 calls for no less and no more than a fair reaction in any given case of juvenile delinquency and crime. The meaning of the expression \"juvenile\" used in a statute by reason of its very nature has to be assigned with reference to a definite date. The term \"juvenile\" must be given a definite connotation. A person cannot be a juvenile for one purpose and an adult for e other purpose. It was, having regard to the constitutional and statutory scheme, not necessary for Parliament to specifically state that the age of juvenile must be determined as on the date of commission of the offence. The same is inbuilt in the statutory scheme. The statute must be construed having regard to the scheme and the ordinary state of affairs and consequences flowing therefrom. The modem approach is to consider whether a child can f live up to the moral and psychological components of criminal responsibility, that is, whether a child, by virtue of his or her individual discernment and understanding can be held responsible for essentially antisocial behaviour. 78. In construing a penal statute, the object of the law must be clearly borne in mind. The importance of time-bound investigation and a trial in relation to an offence allegedly committed by a juvenile is explicit as has g been dealt with in some detail hereinbefore. While making investigation it is expected that the accused would be arrested forthwith. He, upon his arrest; if he appears to be a juvenile, cannot be kept in police custody and may be released on bail. If he is not released on bail by the arresting authority, he has to be produced before the competent court or Board. Once he appears to be juvenile, the competent court and/or Board may pass an appropriate order h upon releasing him on bail or send him to a protective custody.

STATE OF JHARKHAND (Sinha, J.) 583 the purpose of determination of age of the juvenile need not be resorted to if the person produced is admitted to be a juvenile. An inquiry would be necessary only if a dispute is raised in that behalf. A decision thence is required to be taken by the competent court and/or Board having regard to the status of the accused as to whether he is to be released on bail or sent to a protective custody or remanded to police or judicial custody. For the said purpose, what is necessary would be to find out as to whether on the date of commission of the offence he was a juvenile or not as otherwise the purpose for which the Act was enacted would be defeated. The provisions of the said Act, as indicated hereinbefore, clearly postulate that the necessary steps in the proceedings are required to be taken not only for the purpose of adopting a special procedure at the initial stage but also for the intermediary and final stage of the proceedings. If the person concerned is a juvenile, he cannot be tried along with other adult accused. His trial must be held by the Board separately. Having regard to Rule 20.1 of the Rules his case is required to be determined, without any unnecessary delay. In the trial, the right of the juvenile as regards his privacy must be protected. He is entitled to be represented by a legal adviser and to free legal aid, if he applies therefor . His parents and/or guardian are also entitled to participate in the proceedings. The court would be entitled to take into consideration the social inquiry reports wherein the background and the circumstances in which the juvenile was living and the condition in which the offence had been created may be properly investigated so as to facilitate judicious adjudication of the case by the competent authority. At all stages, the court/Board is required to pass an appropriate order expeditiously. Right of a juvenile to get his case disposed of expeditiously is a statutory as also a constitutional right. 79. Even at the final stage viz. after he is found to be guilty of commission of an offence, he must be dealt with differently vis-a-vis adult prisoners. Only because his age is to be determined in a case of dispute by the competent court or the Board in terms of Section 26 (sic) of the Act, the same would not mean that the relevant date therefor would be the one on which he is produced before the Board. If such an argument is accepted, the same would result in absurdity as, in a given case, it would be open to the police authorities not to produce him before the Board before he ceases to be juvenile. If he is produced after he ceases to be juvenile, it may not be necessary for the Board to send him in the protective custody or release him on bail as a result whereof he would be sent to the judicial or police custody which would defeat the very purpose for which the Act had been enacted. Law cannot be applied in an uncertain position. Furthermore, the right to have a fair trial strictly in terms of the Act which would include procedural safeguard is a fundamental right of the juvenile. A proceeding against a juvenile must conform to the provisions of the Act. 80. In Dilip Saha v.

If we interpret Section 28 to mean that it prohibits a joint trial of a a child and an adult only when the child is a 'child' at the time of trial, that interpretation would go against the provisions of Article 20(1) of the Constitution which prescribes that no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force b at the time of the commission of the offence.\" We, with respect, agree with the said observation. 81. The statute, it is well known, must be construed in such a manner so as to make it effective and operative on the principle of ut res magis valeat quam pereat. The courts lean strongly against any constructions which tend to reduce a statute to a futility. When two meanings, one making the statute c absolutely vague, wholly intractable and absolutely meaningless and the other leading to certainty and a meaningful interpretation, are given, in such an event the latter should be followed. (See Tinsukhia Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam 26 , Andhra Bank v. B. Satyanarayana 27 and Indian Handicrafts Emporium v. Union of India 28 .) 82. The submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General that this d Court in Umesh Chandra 2 has wrongly applied the test of imputing mens rea in holding that the Children Act was enacted to protect young children from the consequences of their criminal acts on the footing that their mind at that age cannot be said to be mature as in the case of adult, may have some substance but the said statement of law must be read and understood in the e context of Rule 4.1 of the Rules. So read, the Act would be understood in its proper perspective. 83. The question raised in para 17 of Amit Das 1 is not apposite. A hypothetical question would only lead to a hypothetical answer. The court in an appropriate case is not powerless to pass an order as is contemplated under the statute if the situation so demands but only because a person is f produced before the court after he attains majority either on his own volition or by reason of machinations adopted by the investigating agency, the same would not be determinative of the fact that the said person is to be differently dealt with. Law favours strict adherence to the procedures subject to just exceptions. The Court in Amit Das 1 observed: (SCC p. 497, para 16) \"16. . ..

In short the field sought to be covered by the Act is not the one which had led to juvenile delinquency but the field when a juvenile having committed a delinquency is placed for being taken care of post- delinquency.\" 84. With great respect, we cannot agree to the said statement of law. It is incorrect to say that the preamble speaks of the things of post-delinquency only. The Act not only refers to the obligations of the country to re-enact the existing law relating to juveniles bearing in mind, the standards prescribed in various conventions but also all other international instruments. It states that the said Act was enacted inter alia to consolidate and amend the law relating to juveniles. Once the law relates to delinquent juveniles or juveniles in conflict with law, the same would mean both pre- and post-delinquency. 85. The definition of \"juvenile\" under the 1986 Act, of course refers to a person who has been found to have committed offence but the same has been clarified in the 2000 Act. The provisions of the 1986 Act, as noticed hereinbefore, sought to protect not only those juveniles who have been found to have committed an offence but also those who had been charged therefor. In terms of Section 3 of the 1986 Act as well as the 2000 Act, when an enquiry has been initiated even if the juvenile has ceased to be so as he has crossed the age of 16 and 18 as the case may be, the same must be continued in respect of such person as if he had continued to be a juvenile. Section 3 of the 1986 Act therefore cannot be given effect to if it is held that the same only applied to post-delinquency of the juvenile. 86. The field covered by the Act includes a situation leading to juvenile delinquency vis-a-vis commission of an offence. In such an event he is to be provided the post-delinquency care and for the said purpose the date when delinquency took place would be the relevant date. It must, therefore, be held that the relevant date for determining the age of the juvenile would be one on which the offence has been committed and not when he is produced in court. Re: Question (ii) 87. The salient features of the Act of 2000 may be noticed at the outset. 88. Section 1(3) of the Act of 2000 states that it would come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. The Central Government had issued an appropriate notification in terms whereof 1-4-2001 has been specified as the \"appointed date\" from which the provisions of the said Act will come into force. The Act, thus, is prospective in its operation. However, the Act of 2000 has repealed the Act of 1986. It has obliterated the distinction between juvenile of different sex by reason whereof, a male juvenile would also be juvenile if he has not crossed the age of 18. 89. A person above 16 years in terms of the 1986 Act was not a juvenile.

In terms of the 1986 Act, a person who was not juvenile could be a tried in any court. Section 20 of the Act of 2000 takes care of such a situation stating that despite the same the trial shall continue in that court as if that Act has not been passed and in the event, he is found to be guilty of commission of an offence, a finding to that effect shall be recorded in the judgment of conviction, if any, but instead of passing any sentence in relation to the juvenile, he would be forwarded to the Board which shall pass orders in b accordance with the provisions of the Act as if he has been satisfied on inquiry that a juvenile has committed the offence. A legal fiction has, thus, been created in the said provision. A legal fiction as is well known must be given its full effect although it has its limitations. [See Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. 29 , ITW Signode India Ltd. v. CCE3° andAshok Leyland Ltd. v. State ofT.N. 31 ] c 91. The effect of the expression \"as if' has recently been considered in Maruti Udyog Ltd. v. Ram Lal 32 • 92. Thus, by reason of legal fiction, a person, although not a juvenile, has to be treated to be one by the Board for the purpose of sentencing which takes care of a situation that the person although not a juvenile in tem1s of the d 1986 Act but still would be treated as such under the 2000 Act for the said limited purpose. The Act provides for beneficent consequences and, thus, it is required to be construed liberally. 93. We are not oblivious of the proposition that a beneficent legislation should not be construed so liberally so as to bring within its fore a person who does not answer the statutory scheme. (See Deepal Girishbhai Soni v. e United India Insurance Co. Ltd. 33 ) 94. However, as would appear from the provisions of the Act of 2000 that the scheme of the 2000 Act is such that such a construction is possible. The same would also be evident from Section 64 which deals with a case where a person has been undergoing a sentence but if he is a juvenile within the meaning of the 2000 Act having not crossed the age of 18, the provisions f thereof would apply as if he had been ordered by the Board to be sent to a special home or an institution, as the case may be. 95. Section 20 of the Act of 2000 would, therefore, be applicable when a person is below the age of 18 years as on 1-4-2001. For the purpose of attracting Section 20 of the Act, it must be established that: (i) on the date of coming into force the proceedings in which the petitioner was accused were g pending; and (ii) on that day he was below the age of 18 years.

By reason of the provisions of the said Act of 2000, the protection granted to a juvenile has only been extended but such extension is not absolute but only a limited one. It would apply strictly when the conditions precedent therefor as contained in Section 20 or Section 64 are fulfilled. The said provisions repeatedly refer to the words \"juvenile\" or \"delinquent juveniles\" specifically. This appears to be the object of the Act and for ascertaining the true intent of Parliament, the rule of purposive construction must be adopted. The purpose of the Act would stand defeated if a child continues to be in the company of an adult. Thus, the Act of 2000 intends to give the protection only to a juvenile within the meaning of the said Act and not an adult. In other words, although it would apply to a person who is still a juvenile having not attained the age of 18 years but shall not apply to a person who has already attained the age of 18 years on the date of coming into force thereof or who had not attained the age of 18 years on the date of commission of the offence but has since ceased to be a juvenile. 96. The embargo of giving a retrospective effect to a statute arises only when it takes away vested right of a person. By reasons of Section 20 of the Act no vested right in a person has been taken away, but thereby only an additional protection has been provided to a juvenile. 97. In Rattan Lal v. State of Punjab 34 this Court has held: (SCR p. 681) \"Under Article 20 of the Constitution, no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. But an ex post facto law which only mollifies the rigour of a criminal law does not fall within the said prohibition. If a particular law makes a provision to that effect, though retrospective in operation, it will be valid. The question whether such a law is retrospective and if so, to what extent depends upon the interpretation of a particular statute, having regard to the well-settled rules of construction.\" Referring to Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Subba Rao, J. (as His Lordship then was) opined: (SCR pp. 681-82) \"This is not a case where an act, which was not an offence before the Act, is made an offence under the Act; nor is this a case where under the Act a punishment higher than that obtaining for an offence before the Act is imposed. This is an instance where neither the ingredients of the offence nor the limits of the sentence are disturbed, but a provision is made to help the reformation of an accused through the agency of the court. Even so the statute affects an offence committed before it was extended to the area in question. It is, therefore, a post facto law and has retrospective operation. In considering the scope of such a provision we must adopt the rule of beneficial construction as enunciated by the 34 (1964) 7 SCR 676: (1965) 1 Cri LJ 360 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

State of Kerala 35 this Court held: (SCC p. a 614, para 12) \"If the Act had contained any provisions to the detriment of the accused, then undoubtedly, it would have been hit by the rule against post facto legislation contained in Article 20(1). However, we find that the amendments (at least the ones rationalising the sentencing structure) are more beneficial to the accused and amount to mollification of the rigour b of the law. Consequently, despite retrospectivity, they ought to be applied to the cases pending before the Court or even to cases pending investigation on the date on which the amending Act came into force. Such application would not be hit by Article 20(1) of the Constitution.\" 99. Section 6(1) and Section 8 of the Human Rights Act, 1998 of the United Kingdom also provide for expeditious disposal of cases. The effect of c non-fulfilment of the requirement that a criminal charge be heard within a reasonable time came up for consideration recently before the House of Lords in Attorney General's Reference (No. 2 of 2001)3 6 wherein it was held that the remedy as regards breach of reasonable time guarantee would depend upon the facts involved in each case. While holding such a right exists in an d accused, it was observed: \"This reasoning depends, as I have said, on categorizing the within-a-reasonable-time obligation as referring to a characteristic of the hearing or determination just as are the 'fair', 'public', 'independent', 'impartial' and 'tribunal established by law' requirements. It is this categorization which I suggest is fundamentally wrong. A within-a- e reasonable-time obligation relates to a quality of the performance, not to the attributes of the service or article - here the hearing or determination - to be provided by the person under the obligation. This may all sound oversophisticated but it can be simply demonstrated both as a matter of the ordinary use of language and by reference to basic principles of the law of obligations.\" 100. In India such a right of expeditious disposal is contained in Article 21 of the Constitution, the relevance whereof for the purpose of interpretation of the Act cannot be minimised. f 101.

State of Rajasthan 39 this Court upon referring to Rattan Lal34 held: (SCC p. 727, para 11) \"11. The decision approves of the principle that ex post facto law which only mollifies the rigour of the criminal law, though retrospective in operation, will be valid. After enunciating this principle the Court interpreted Section 11 of the Probation of Offenders Act and came to the conclusion that on a true interpretation of the provision the High Court had jurisdiction to exercise the power at the appellate stage, and this power was not confined to a case where the trial court could have made that order. The phraseology of the section was wide enough to enable the appellate court or the High Court when the case came before it, to make such an order. We, therefore, do not find that Rattan Lal34 made a departure from the well-settled principle that no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of that act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than with which he might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. This Court only laid down the principle that an ex post facto law which only mollifies the rigour of a criminal law did not fall within the said prohibition, and if a particular law made a provision to that effect, though retrospective in operation, it will be valid.\" 103. Interpretation of a statute depends upon the text and context thereof and having regard and object with which the same was made. 104. The aforementioned provision of the 2000 Act is furthermore a remedial statute. (See discussions of G.P. Singh 's Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 9th Edn ., 2004, p. 733 .) They are, thus, required to be given liberal construction. 105. A remedial statute applied in a pending proceeding would not mean that thereby a retrospective effect and retroactive operation is being given thereto. 106. We do not intend to say that no other view is possible . But in a case of this nature where an additional protection had been granted pursuant to or in furtherance of the international treaties and keeping in view the experience which had been gathered by Parliament after coming into force of the 1986 Act, we think that it should be read in such a fashion so that the extended benefit can be granted even to the juvenile under the 2000 Act. Furthermore, sub-section (2) of Section 69 provides that all proceedings shall be deemed to have been held under the new Act. This is also suggestive of the fact that the new Act would, to the aforementioned extent, apply to a pending proceeding which was initiated under the 1986 Act. Model Rules 107.

It is one thing that the rules validly framed are to be treated as part of the Act as has been held in Chief Forest Conservator (Wildlife) v. Nisar Khan 40 and National Insurance Co. a Ltd. v. Swaran Singh 41 but the said principle has no application herein as in terms of the provisions of the said Act, the Central Government does not have any authority to make any rules. In the absence of any rule-making power it cannot refer to the omnibus clause of power to remove difficulty inasmuch as it has not been stated that framing of any model rule is permissible if a difficulty arises in giving effect to the provision of the Act. The Central b Government is a statutory functionary. Its functions are circumscribed by Section 70 of the Act only. It has not been authorised to make any rule. Such rule-making power has been entrusted only to the State. The Central Government has, thus, no say in the matter nor can it exercise such power by resorting to its power \"to remove difficulties\". Rule-making power is a separate power which has got nothing to do with the power to remove c difficulty. By reason of the power to remove difficulty or doubt, the Central Government has not been conferred with any legislative power. The power to remove doubt or difficulty although is a statutory power but the same is not akin to a legislative power and, thus, thereby the provisions of the Act cannot be altered. [See Jalan Trading Co. (P) Ltd. v. Mill Mazdoor Union 42 , AIR at p. 703.] d 108. The age of the delinquent juvenile, therefore, cannot be determined in terms of Model Rule 62. Any law mandating the court to take into consideration certain documents over others in determining an issue, must be provided for only by law. Only a validly made law can take away the power of the court to appreciate evidence for the purpose of determination of such a question in the light of Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act. It cannot be e done by the Central Government in exercise of the executive power. (See Union of India v. Naveen Jindal 43 and State of U.P. v. Johri Mal 44 .) 109. In Birad Mal Singhvi v.

The age of a person in an election petition has to be determined not only on the basis of the materials placed on record but also upon taking into consideration the circumstances attending thereto. The initial burden to prove the allegations made in the election petition although was upon the election petitioner but for proving the facts which were within the special knowledge of the respondent, the burden was upon him in terms of Section 106 of the Evidence Act. It is also trite that when both parties have adduced evidence, the question of the onus of proof becomes academic [see Union of India v. Sugauli Sugar Works (P) Ltd. 47 and Cox and Kings (Agents) Ltd. v. Workmen 48 ]. Furthermore, an admission on the part of a party to the lis shall be binding on him and in any event a presumption must be made that the same is taken to be established.\" This Court therein followed, inter alia, Birad Mal Singhvi v.

The Court, therefore, must determine the age of the appellant herein keeping in view our aforementioned findings that the relevant date for reckoning the age of the juvenile would be the date of occurrence and not the date on which he was produced before the Board. 112. The upshot of the aforementioned discussions is: (i) In tenns of the 1986 Act, the age of the offender must be reckoned from the date when the alleged offence was committed. (ii) The 2000 Act will have a limited application in the cases pending under the 1986 Act. (iii) The Model Rules framed by the Central Government having no legal force cannot be given effect to.
