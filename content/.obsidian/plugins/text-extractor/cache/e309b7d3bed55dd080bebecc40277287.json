Patliak, J. gave a sepa- rate Opinion. KRISHNA IYER, J.-This writ petition origillated, epistolary fashion. in a letter by a prisoner, Batra, to a. Judge of this Court (one of us). complaining o~ a brutal assault by a. Head Warder on another prisoner, Prem Chand. Forms were forsaken since freedom was at stake and the letter was posted on the Bench to be metamorphosed into a habeas proceeding and wa' judicially navigated with electric creativity, thanks to the humanist scholarship of Dr. Y. S. Chitale as amicus curiae, and )Ir the erudite passion for affirmative court action of Shri Soli Sorabjee, the learned Solicitor General. Where the prison process is de-huma- nised, forensic help, undeflected by the negative cruidities of the adver- sary system, makes us dare where we might have daunted. The finest hour of justice comes when court and counsel constructively collabo- rate to fashion a relief in the individual case and fathom deeper tCJ cure the institutional pathology which breeds wrongs and defies rights. Here, the individual is a prisoner whose anus was allegedly pierced with a warder's baton and the institution is the Tiha.r Prison, right hi the capital of the country and under the nose of the Home Mini~try. The Perspective This case is revelatqry of serveral sins in this central penitentiary. 'Something is rotten in the' State of Denmark!' The constitutional imperative which informs our perspective in this habeas corpus pro- ceeding must first be set out. The rule of law meets with its Water- loo when the State's minions become law-breakers and so the court, as the sentinel of the nation and the voice of the Constitution, runs down the violators wilb its writ and secures compliance with human rights even behind iJron bars and by prison warders. This case is at once a symptom, a symbol and a signpost vis a vis human rights in prison situations. When prison trauma prevails, prison justice must invigilate and hence we broaden our 'habeas' jurisdiction. Jurispru- dence. cannot slumber when the very campuses ofi punitive justice wit- ness torture. The petitione.r does not seek the release of the prisoner because a life sentence keeps him in confinment. But the dynamic role of judicial remedies, after Batrcis case('), imparts to the habeas corpus writ a versatile vitality and operational utility that makes the healing presence of the law live up to its reputation as bastion ·of liberty even within the secrecy of the hidden cell. Blackstone called it 'the (l) Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration [1979] l SCR 392c \\_.. . • • • SUNJL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, /.) 563 great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement' and Lord Deman proclaimed in 1839 that it had been 'fetr ag~ effectual to an extent never known in any other country'. So long as Batra remaiias good law, judicial policing of Bastille practices will broaden to embarce the wider range of prison vices. Dr. Chitale drew our attention to American legal literature discl(l;ing the trend while Shri Soll Sorabjee for the Union of India, cited Corwin. Corwin's re- marks on American constitutional law, referred to with approval in Britra, bas our(') assent: Federal courts have intensified their oversight of State penal facilities, reflecting a heightened concern with the ex- tent to which the ills that plauge so-called correctional insti- tution overcrowding, understaffing unsanitary facilities, bru- tality, constant fear of violence, lack; of adequate medica~ and mental health care, poor food service, intrusive correspon- dence restrictions, inhumane isolation, segregation, inade- '1uate or non-existent rehabilitative and/or educational pro- grams, deficient recreational opportunities-violate• the Eighth Amendment ban on \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" 'Ifae essence of the matter is that in our era of human rights consciousness the habeas writ has functiona~ plurality and the constitu• tional regard for human decency auci dignity is tested by this capability. B· C: We ideologically accept the words of Will Durant( 2). \"It is time for it; \" all good men to come to• the aid of their party, whose naTnd is civiliza- tion.\" Likewise, we endorse, as1 part of our constitutional thought, what the British Government's White Paper, titled 'People in Prison', stated with telling effect : A society that believes in the worth of individual beings Jr' can have the quality of its belief judges, at least in part, by the quality of its prison and probate services and of the re- 5:ources made available to them. The learned Solicitor General brought this key-note thought to our notice in the matchless diction of Sir Winston Churchi!\\ and briefly re- G· ferred to in Batra ( ') in a speech seventy years ago : The mood and temper of the public in regard to the treat- ment of crime and criminals is one of the lllO!;t unfailing tests of the civilisation of any country.

The resume of facts, foul on its face, reveals the JegnI issues raised, brings into focus the basics of prisoner's rights and helps the court -G forge remedial directives so as to harmonise the expending habeas juris- prudence with dawning horizons of human rights and enlightened mea- sures of prison discipline. Batra, a convict under death sentence lodged in the Tihar Central Jail, came to know of a crime of torture practised upon another prisoner, Prem Chand, allegedly by a jail warder, Maggar Singh, as a means to extract money from the victim through his n visiting relations.

DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer,!.) 565 and brought the incident to the ken of the Court, resulting in these proceedings which, though not strictly traditional, are clearly in the nature of habeas corpus writs and therefore, within the wider sweep of Art. 32. The court issued notice to the State and the concerned officials, appointed Dr. Y. S. Chitale and Shri Mukul Mudgal .as! amicus, authorised them to visit the prison, meet the prisoner and see relevant documents and interview necessary witnesses so as to enable them to inform themselves about the surrounding circumstan- ces and the cruel scenario of events. Counsel on both sides have sensitized the issue of prison justice admirably and catalysed the caus\" of jail reforms effectively. The democratic hope of the profes- sion is its 'people's orientation, not its lucrative potential nor its intellec- tual intricacies. And service in the field of the handicapped human sectors, like prisoners, is a social justice contribution. The enthusia- stic work done in the case by the young lawyer, Shri Mudgal, assis- ting Dr. Chitale, deserves our commendation, even as the unreserved support rendered to the Court by Shri Sachthey is in the good tradition of the Bar. !lack to the facts. One Central episode round which the skein of further facts is wound is beyond doubt, viz. that Prem Chand, the prisoner, sustained serious anal injury on or about Augnst 26, 1979, because a rod was driven into that sore ape.rture to inflict inhuman tor- c: ture. The contemporaneous entry in the Jail Hospital register reads : E. One prisoner Prem Chand s/o Pyara Lal has deve- loped tear of anus du~ tq forced iq.sertion of stick by! Remarks of Superin- someone,. He require surgical repair and his bleed- ~ tendent. Noted 27 ing has not stopped. He is to go to Irwin Hospital j Aug., 79 sd D.S.1.2.35 p.m. ca.sulty immediately. Sd/· p (DR. KAPOOR) 2·00 p.m. The prisoner's later narration to the doctor in the Irwin Hospital cor- roboraies the case. The unsuccessful and unworthy attempts, pre>- sumably by overawing the prisoner and even the doctor, and other dubious devices, which we do not now scan, to do away with this primary incriminating factor by offering incredible alternatives like ruptw-e of the anus by a fall or self-infliction or due to piles and sillier stories. only show how the subtle torture of the officials could extract falsehoods from the victim and even medical officers, exclupatory of the official criminal whoever he be. There are some traces of attempts to hush up the crime where the higher officers have not been that' innocent. We are taken aback that the tardy polica investigation; G. --- _.j.. SGS SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1980] 2 S.C.R •. :.ti. with its lethargic pact4 and collusive ways, ha~ hardly done credit to the Police Department's integrity, a fact that the Government will take note of, withont institutional sheltering of police delinquents. Imagine a police investigator, hunting for contradictions obviously to absolve the head warder by interrogating Dr. Kapoor who bad made an entry in the hospital register and told Dr. Chitale that the prisoner had an anal rupture which could not be self-inflicted or caused by a fall and was so serious as to require immediate removal to Irwin Hos- pital, and making him say, long afterwards on 2-10-1979 by delaying the laying of the chargesheet thus : \"A prisoner named Prem Chand •/o Prehlad was pro- <(; duced before me for treatment on the afternoon of Snnday 26th August, 1979. He was bronght by some wa;der. He was complaining of bleeding from boils on the buttocks. 'This was also told by the warder who brought him. He was given the required treatment as he was kept under observation on his request. Next day during th\"' ward rounds when I examined him, he was having tears of anu~ and bleeding. On inquiring he told that this has happened due to forced insertion of a stick irito his anus. Then he was referred to Irwin Hospital for further treatment. V. K Kapoor 2-10-79\" Can human nature be such rubbec ? More than the probity of the investigation and the veracity of the ol<' . doctor are at stake-hope in human integrity without which human dignity will be the first casualty. •G These observations are not impressionistic but we leave it at that since our primary purpose is to protect the person of the prisoner, not to prosecute the offender. We do not wish to prejudice that proce8s. Regrettably, the 'hearsay' affidavit of the Under Secretary (Home), Delhi Administration, Shri Nathu Ram, blinks at the jail vices and merely dresses up the official version without so much as an inquisitorial audit of the lurid happenings in a premier correctional institution of the nation. We deplore the indifferent affiant's omni- bus approval of every official conduct, whereas we should, instead, have expected Government, which sincerely swears by human rights and whose politiciil echelons in succession, over the decades; are not strangers to the actualities in these detention campuses to have put •• ( • • > SUNIL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, J.) 567 :aside the tendency to white-wash every action with an official flavour. Where human rights afe at stake prestige has no place. After the prisoner was subjected to brutal hurt he was removed to the jail hospital and later to the Irwin Hospital but an his re-transfer be was neglected; but we do not pursue the identity of the culprit or the crime or the treatment since a police investigation i' under way. Nevertheless, we cannot but remark that whatever damage might hav(l been done upto now, a secon<l investigation by a C.B.I. officer is justi- fied, if truth has been suppressed. Dr. Chitale pointed out certain ---- _ i poignant facts such as the prisoner himself having been pressured into -statements contrary to the case of anal infliction. We do not make comments on them although we are unhappy at the way the busines~ of investigation has been done. Indeed, the potential for oblique mutual help between the police and the prison staff makes Jail offences by jail ofucia1s undetectable; and so0 to obviate this possibility, the CB.I. may well be entrusted, as a regular practice, with such cases The prisoner being a person, we cannot write him off. The alleged offender, Warder Maggar Singh, may be left aside for :a while. Thertj are other aspects of thei torture which demand deeper probe and panacea. The prisoner's explanation for the anal rupture is stated to be an unfulfilled demand for mOJJey, allegedly a general practice. This shows, if true, that bribery, at the point of barbarity, is a flourishing trade within 1he house of punishment itse1f. How stern should the sentence be for such official criminals andl how diligent should the State be to stamp out this wicked temptation ! If you want to end prison delinquencies you must abolish the motivations and oppor- tunities. A B c D The counter-case, if we may so call it, of the Warder as discl0sed F • in the Superintendent's report, is equally disturbing, if true : On 25-8-79 evening life prisoner Prem Chand S/o Sh. Prahlad was produced before the Deputy Superintendent for takinii Mandrix tablets. As he was in state of intoxicatiQn because of taking Mandrix tablets which he admitted before the Deputy Superintendent, he was kept in a cell pending orders of the Superintendent. Central Jail. He was taken to the jail hospita] the next day i.e. on 26-8-79 on a: report from the above said prisoner as he had pain in his anus and was bleeding. The prisoner remained admitted into the jail hospital upto 27-8-79, 2 p.m. when the Dr. V. K. Kapoor, Medical Officer, recommended for the shifting of this prisoner to the Irwin Hospital with the report mentioned in the petition. G H B c D E F G B 568 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1980] 2 s.c.R. The prisoner Prem Chand was shifted accordingly by Shri Bachan Singh, Assistant Superintendent on duty on 27-8-79. TI1e undersigned was informed that a case u/s 385 IPC had been registered against warder Maggar Singh in-charge of the ward No. 11 i.e. 40 cells with the police station Janak· puri and investigation had started in this case. The result of the investigation is still awaited. The prisone~ was, however, received back in the jail on 29-8-79 Qn being discharged from the Irwin Hospital. The prisoner, Prem Chand, was kept in a 'punishment cell' which, according to counsel for the Administration, was not as bad as a soli- tary cell, although Dr. Chitale says that this was similar to the type of insulated confinement condemned as unconstitutional by this Court in Sunil Batra's case (supra). Coming to the competing version put for- ward by the prison officials through the counter-affidavit of the Under Secretary, the story, even if true, is strongly suggestive of a mafia-culture prevasive illl the Tihar prison. A background of the ethos of the campus may be gleaned from portions of the report of the Superintendent, Central Jail, Tihar, made by him with reference t~ the alleged torture which is the subject matter of this case. A number of prisoners in the Tillar Jail are habitual offenders, professional criminals who have been inmates of the jail from time to time. A number of the said prisoners are rarely visited by their relatives due to the fact that they . do not want to associate with such persons. I~ has been seen that such prisone.rs are mainly visited by other professionals or habitual offenders in the field with whom they have had former associations. . . . It has been noticed these types of prisoners have been able to develop a certain raport with some of the lower staff in the jail namely Head Warders, Warders etc. and obtain certain facilities illegally including smuggling of numbers of items, i.e. drugs etc. for their use. It may also be submitted that to check smuggling of narcotic( drugs against prisoners who indulge in such activities 30 cases of narcotic offences were got registered against the prisoners with the Janakpuri Police Station during this year .... That 95 prisoners were transferred from the jail to Haryana due to administrative reasons which include indiscipline and violation of jail regulations by them and otherwise derogatory behaviour during the last year. . . . . . This year also about 22 cases have been recqmmended by Superintendent, Jail for transfer . . . . In para 5 68 (b) and the note thereunder of the ,. .·~ • • . SUNIL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, !.) 569 Jail Manuai the habituals are required to be kept separate from the casual prisoners but due to non-availability 'of any other jail in Delhi they are being kept in Tihar Jail, which requires a lot ofj vigilance on the part of the jail officers. (b) It may also be mentioned that due to paucity of accommoda- tion, the said jail is occupied by double the number of prisoners than it is otherwise authorised. To aggravate the malady, we have tQe fact that a substantial number of the prisoners am under-trials who have to face, their case in court j and are presumably innocent until convicted. By being sent to Tihar A B Jail they are, by contamination, made criminals-a custodial perversity which violates the test of reasonableness in Art. 19 and of fairness in C Art. 21. How cruel would it be if one went to a hospital for a check- ' up .and by being kept along with contagious cases came home with a new disease ! We sound the tocsin that prison reform is now a consti- tutional compulsion and its neglect may lead to drastic court action. It would appear that around 300 persons are taken in and out D daily between the prison and the courts. And when there are political agitations. and consequent police arrests and remand to custody, the under-trial strength swells in numbers. Since many Qfficers busy them- selves with production· of p.risoners in court, the case of the Superin- tendent is that the. other. prisoners \"try to .do mischief, make thefts of other prisonets who go on work, smuggle things and everz resort to E assaults.\" To sum up, the Tihar prison is an arena of tension ,trauma, tant- rums .and crimes of .violence, vulgarity and ccrruption. And to cap it all, there occurs the contamination of pre-trial accused with habituals and \"injurious prisoners of international gang.\" The crowning piece is that p the jail officials themselves are allegedly in league with the criminals in thei cells. That is, there is a large network of criminals, officials and non-officials in the house of . correction ! Drug racket, alcoholism, smuggling. violence, theft, unconstitutional punishment by way of solitary cellular life and transfers to other jai~·are not uncommoo. The Administration, if it does not immediately have the horrendous sitU;t-, G lion examined by an impartiJil, authoritative body, and sanitize the campus, complacent affidavits of Under Secretaries and glittering entries from dignitaries on their casual visits, cannot help. ' While the Establishment sought to produce before the Court extracts from the Visitors' Book to show that many impartial and dis-, H tinguished persons had complimented the jail authorities on the way managed the prison, Dr. Chitale placed before us some internal evidence 15-21SCI/80. A B c 0 E F G H 570 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1980] 2 S.C.R. from the materials on record, supplemented strongly by personal obser- vations recorded while he was an internee in this very prison by Sbri Kuldip Nayar, a responsible journalist with nil apparent motive for mendacity nor inclination for subjectivity, in bis book \"In Jail\". There was nothing in the author's view which money could not buy within the recesses of the prison campus. Giving a factual narrative, Shri Nayar wrote: .... -.. ' ...... one could get as much money as one wanted from outside-again, at a price. The.re was, a money order and mail service that perhaps was more dependable than what the postal department c~uld offer. For instance, when a prisoner in my ward wanted two hundred rupees, he sent a note through a warder to his people in Old Delhi and in less than twenty-four hours he had the money. He paid sixty-six· rupees as collecting charges- thirty-three per cent was the prescribed \"money order charge.\" ...... Dharma Teja, the shipping magnate who served his sentence in Tihar, for instance, had thousands of rupees delivered to him, we were told. And if one could pay the jail functionaries one could have all the comforts one sought. Teja bad all the comforts-he had an air cooler in his cell a radio-cum-record player set and even the facility of using the phone. . . . Haridas Mundhra, a businessman who was convicte.d of fraud, was ano~er rich man who spent some time in tihar. Not only did he have' all the facilities, but be could also go out of the jail whenever he liked; at times he would be out for several days and travel even upto Calcutta. All this of course, cost a lot of money. An even richer prisoner was Ram Kishan Dalmia; he spent most of bis jail terrn in hospital. He was known for his generosity to jail authorities, and one doctor received a car as a gift. But more than businessmen it was the smugglers jailed in Tihar who were lavish spenders. Their food came from Moti Mahal and their whisky from Connaught Place. They had not only wine but also women. \"Babuji, not tarts but real society girls,\" one warder said. The women would be brought in when \"the Sahiblog\" went home for lunch, and their empty offices became \"recreation rooms.\" Corruption in jail was so well organised and so systematic that everything went like clockwork once the price had been paid. Jail employees at almost all levels were involved, and everyone's share was fixed. There was never a dispute; there has to be the proverbial honour among thieves.' SUNIL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, !.) 5 71 One wonders whether such an indictment made by an established A -writer had inclined the Government at least to appoint an Inquiry Commission to acquaint itself with the criminal life-style of correc- tional institutinns. The higher officials also have their finger in the pie, if Nayar were veracious: 'Perhaps the way almost everyone had his cut was most evident in our milk supply. It came in bulk to the main gate (phatak) there, enough milk for the top officials was taken out of the cans, which were then topped up with water. And as the cans moved to the wards, all those who handled them appropriated their share,,again topping np with water. B. Even more shocking than the corruption was the ingenious \"slave system\" we found in the jail. The slaves were boys between ten and eighteen employed as 'helpers\", and there were scores of them. They cooked, washed uten- sils, cleaned rooms, fetched water and did much back- breakinE lab.our to \"help\" the men who were paid to do these chores. They would be woken up before 6 a.m. to prepare the morning tea and would be allowed to sleep around 10 p.m. after scrubbing the pots and pans-they were herded into a ward which had no fan and no proper sanitary facilities, but was always well lit, with many bulbs on all night, to enable a sleepy warder to check at a glance that they were all there. c These boys were undertrial prisoners; many had been there for eight months and at least one had been there for two years. They were taken from one court to another to be tried under one charge or another and kept in jail all the while. The aim was to keep them in as long as possible, for without them the people employed to do the menial duties would have no time to relax. One morning I was woken up by the sobbing of a boy, and fol!nd some other \"helpers\" trying to console him while a warder stood by quite unmoved. I went up to him; his curly hair reminded me of Raju, my younger son. The boy had been picked up the previous evening from Defence Colony in New Debi-, kept in a police lock-up for the night and brought to jail in the morning.' The crime of punishment is a new crime which the rule of law must reach at ,but what is touchiu~ beyond tears, even if there be but .a title of truth in the statement \"In Jail,\" is about children being lapped D F G H SUNIL BATRA v. DELm ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, !.) 573 Corpus JuriJ;, 2d, Vol. 39, page 274, para 7 strikes a similar note, away frum the traditional strain. The courts in America have, through the decisional process, brought the rule of law into the prison system pushing back, protanto, the hands-off doctrine. In the leading case of Coffin v. Richard(') the Court of Appeal observed, <delineating the ambit and uses of the writ of habeas corpus : The Government has the absolute right to hold prisoners for offences against it but it also haS the correlative duty to protect them against assault or injury from any quarter 1 while so held. A prisoner is entitled to the writ of habeas corpus when, though lawfully in custody, he is deprived of some right to which he is lawfully entitled even in his con- finement, the deprivation of which serves to make his im- prisonment more burdensOJ!J.e than the law allows or {:llrtails his liberty to a greater extent than the law permits. When a man possesses a substantial right, the court will be diligent in finding a way to protect it. The fact that a person is legally in prison does· not prevent the use of habeas corpus to protect his other inherent rights .... The judge is not limited to a simple remand or discharge of the prisoner's civil rights be respected .•.... It is significant that the United State Supreme Court has even con- sidered as suitable for habeas relief, censorship of prisoners' mail and the ban on the use of law students to conduct interviews with prison inmates in matters of legal relief. In Procunier v. Martinez(') theSe two questions fell for decision -and the court exercised jurisdiction even in such an internal matter. In Johnson v. Avery(') a disciplinary action was challenged by a prisoner through a writ of habeas corpus. This indicates the extension of the nature of the writ in the American! jnrisdiction. Incidentally and interestingly, there is reference to some States in the United States experimenting with programmes of allowing senior law stndents to service the penitentiaries. At a later stage, when we concretise definite directives, we may have occasion to refer to the use of senior law students for rendering legal aid to prisoners; and so it is worthwhile extracting a passage from ! ohnson v. A very {supra) with reference to the Kansas Law School Programme in Prisons at Leavenworth : The experience at Leavenworth has shown that there have been very few attacks upon the (prison) administra- (1) 143 F. 2d 443 at 445.

A large part of the activity was disposing of long outstanding detainers lodged against the inmates. In addition, the programme handles civil matters such as domestic relations problems and compensation claims. Even where there has been no tangible success, the fact that the inmate had someone on the outside listen to him and analyse his problems had a most beneficial effect. . We think that these programmes have been beneficial not only to the inmates but to the students, the staff and the courts. Incidentally, the presence of law students at the elbow of the prisoner has a preventive effect on ward and warden. The content of our constitutional liberties being no less, the dyna- mics of habeas writs there developed help the judicial process here. , Indeed, the full potential of Arts. 21, 19, 14, after Maneka Gandhi (supra), has been unfolded by this Court in Hoskot and Batra. Today,. human rights jurisprudence in India has a constitutional status and sweep, thanks to Art. 21 so that this magna carta may well toll the knell of human bondage beyond civilised limits. The supplementary statement of the Superintendent of the Central Jail (partly quoted earlier) hair-raising when we find that far from rehabilitation, intensification of criminality is happening there and the officials are part of this sub-culture. We, certainly do not wish to generalise but do mean to highlight the facts of life behind the high ·----y- walls as demanding constitutional and administrative attention. Homage to human rights, if it springs from the heart, calls for action. F Prisons, prison staff and prisoners-all three are in need of reforma- tion. And this milieu apparently is not unique to Tihar but common to many penal institutions. It is refreshing and heartening that the learned Solicitor General' widened our vista and argued that this court, having been seized of the problem of prisoners' fundamental freedoms and their traumatic G abridgement, should give guide-lines in this uncharted area, design procedures and device mechanisms which will go into effective action when the restricted yet real rights of prisoners are overtly or covertly invaded. The jurisdiction of this court to remedy the violations .of prisoners' residuary rights was discussed at the bar, as also the package· of plausible measures which may appropriately be issued to ensure the functional success of justice when rights are infringed by officials or fellow-prisoners. Both sides appreciated the gravity of the jail situa- tion, the sensitivity of security considerations, the virginity of this. • SUNIL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, .T.) 5 7 5 .....,• field of law and the necessity for normative rules and operative moni- A toring within the framework of judicial remedies. This constructive stance of counsel unusual in litigative negativity, facilitated our resolu- tion of the problems of jail justice, despite the touch of jurisprudential novelty and call to judicial creativity. We must formulate the points argued before we proceed to state B our reasoning and record our conclusions. 1. Has the court jurisdiction to consider prisoners' grievance, not demanding release but, within the incarceratory circumstances, com- plaining of ill-treatment and curfai!ment short of illegal detention? Yes. We have answered it. 2. What are the broad contours of the fundamental rights, espe- cially Arts. 14, 19 and 21 which belong to a detainee sentenced by Court? Here too, the ground has been covered. 3. What judicial remedies can be granted to prevent and punish their breach and to provide access to prison justice? 4. What practicable prescriptions and proscriptions bearing on r prison practices can be drawn up by the court consistently with the _, existing provisions of the Prisons Act and Rules bent to ';hapc to con, ·' form to Part III ? r ... 5. What prisog reform perspectives and strategies shculd be adopted to strengthen, in the long run, the constitutional mandates and human rights imperatives? The canvas was spread wide by counsel and court and we deal with the arguments within the larger spread-out of lhe case. Rulings of this court have highlighted the fact that the framers of our Consti- tution have freed the powers under Art. 32 from the rigid restraints of the traditional English writs. Flexible directives, even affirmative action moulded to grant rehef may realistically be issued and fall within its fertile width. The jurisdictional dimension is luscently laid down by Subba Rao, J. in Dwarkanath's case('): This article is couched in comprehensive phraseology and it ex fade confers a wide power on the High Courts to reach injustice wherever it is found. The Constitution de- signedly used a wide language in describing the nature of the power, the purpose for which and the person or authority against whom it can be exercised. It can issue writs in the nature of prerogative writs as understood in England; but the scope of those writs also is widened by the use of the (!) Dwarkanath v. l.T.O.

DELID ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, 1.) 577 ~ • -culture has now crystallised in favour of prison justice and judicial A r <, .. .~urisdiction. (') The jurisdictional reach and range of this court's writ to hold prison caprice and cruelty in constitutional leash is in- contentable, but teasing intrusion into administrative discre- tion is legal anathema absent breaches of constitutional rights or prescribed procedures. The U.S. Supreme Court, in like situations, has spoken firmly and 'humanistically, and these observations have the tacit approval of our <Court in Batra's case. Justice Douglas put it thus.(2). Prisoners are still 'persons' entitled to all constitutional rights unless their liberty has been constitutionally curtailed by procedures that satisfy all the requirements of due pro- cess, J11stice Marshall strongly seconded the view : I have previously stated my view that a prisoner does B c not shed his basic constitutional rights at the prison gate, D and I fully support the court's holding that the interest of inmates in freedom from imposition of serious discipline is a 'liberty' entitled to due process protection. We, therefore, affirm that wh_!!re the rights of a prisoner, either under the Constitution or under other law, are violated the writ power E of the court can and should run to his rescue. There is a warrant for this vigil. The court process casts the convict into the prison system and the deprivation of his freedom is not a blind penitentiary afiliction but a belighted institntionalisation geared to a social good. The court has' a contitnning responsibility to ensure that the consti· tutional purpose of the deprivation is not defeated by the prison F administration. In a few cases, this validation of judicial invigilation of prisoners' condition has been voiced by this court and finally rein- forced by the Constitution Bench in Batra (supra)(') The Court need not adopt a \"hands oil\" attitude .... in regard to the problem of prison administration. It is G all the more so because a convict is in prison under the order and direction of the court.\" Under the caption \"Retention of Authority over Prisoner by Sentencing Judge\" Krantz notes:(') (1) Sumi Batra v. Delhi Admn. [1979) 1 S.CR. 392 at 409-410. (2) Ibid p, 412. (3) Ibid p, 496. (4) Sheldon Krantz, Corrections and Prisoners' Rights at 274-75. H SUNIL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, J.) 579 ' ~ No iron curtain can be drawn between the prisoner and the Con- A > ' ... • ,. stitution. It is, therefore, the court's concern, implicit in the power to deprive the sentences of his personal liberty, to ensure that no more and no less than is warranted by the sentence happens. If the prisoner breaks down because of mental torture, psychic pressure or physical infiic:ion beyond the licit limits C1f lawful imprisonment the Prison Administration shall be liable for the excess. On the contrary, if an influential convict is able to buy advantages and liberties to avoid or water down t]J.~ deprivation implied in the sentence the Prison Estab- lishment will be called to order for such adulteration or dilution of court sentences by executive pa\\liation, if unwarranted by law. One o~ us, in Batra observed : Suffice it to say that, so long as judges are invigilators and enforcers of constitutionality and performance auditors of legality, and convicts serve terms in that grim microcosm called prison by the mandate of the courts, a continuing institutional responsibility vests in the system to monitor in the incarceratory process and prevent security 'excesses' J ai!ors are bound by the rule of law and cannot inflict sup- plementary sentence under disguises or defeat the primary purposes of imprisonment. The upshot of this discussion is but this. The Court has power and responsibility to intervene and protect the prisoner against may- hem, crude or subtle, and may use habeas corpus for enforcing in- prison humanism and forbiddance of harsher restraints and heavier severities than the sentence carries. We hold these propositions to be self-evident in our constitutional order and is supported by authority, if need be. Therefore, we issue the writ to the Lt. Governor and the Superintendent of the Central Jail that the prisoner, Prem Chand, shall not be subjected to physical manhandling by any jail official, that the shameful and painful torture to which he has been subjected- a blot on Government's claim to protect human rights-·shall be ended and the wound on his person given proper medical care and treatment. The Central Government will, we are sure, direct its Jail staff not show too pachydermic a disposition for a democratic government. For example, specific guidelines before punishing a prisoner had been given in Batra's case and yet the prisoner Prem Chand has been lodged in the punishment cell, which is almost the same as a solitary cell, with cavalier disregard for procedural safeguards. Merely to plead that many prisoners are 'habituals' is no ground for habitual c E G H 580 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1980] 2 s.c.R. A violation of law by officials. We direct that Prem Chand be released r, from the punishment cell and shall not be subjected to such severity until fair procedure is complied with. The chronic callousness of the Prison System to· the humane demands of the Constitution, despite the fact that many ministers over B many decades in many States have known the unbroken tradition of prison sub-culture and despite prison diaries of national figures from Jawabarlal Nehru to Jay Prakash Narain, bas made court and counsel benignly turn the judicial focus on the future so that further mischief may not be suffered in incarceration. There is little doubt that bar- barities like bar betters and band-cuffs were recklessly being practised either on account of ignorant unconscionableness or wilful viciousness in several detention camps. Many of the victims are poor, mute, illiterate, desperate and destitute an~ too distant from the law to be aware of their rights or ask for access to justice, especially when the nmriing tension of the· prison and the grisely potential for zoological reprisals stare them in the face. So it is for the court to harken when humanity calls, without waiting for particular petitions. Like class actions, class remedies have pro bona value. E F G H The court-the .learned Solicitor General underscored this cons- tructive approach-must not wait for a stray petition from some weeping inmate and give the little person a little relief in the little case but give the nation, its governments, prison establishments and correctional departments, needed guidance and also fill with hope the hearts of those who cherish human rights that the courts are, after all, sentinels on the qui vive. Law is what law does and court, if any- thing, are constitutional in action. Dr. Chitale, naturally, joined this moving demand. We do think that there are many, drawn from the class of penury, who suffer more privations than their sentences justify. Ralph Ellison's picture of the American Black bas relevance for the prisoner here:' I am an invisible man .... I am a man of substance, of fiesb and bone, fibre an liquids-and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me .... When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figmenu of thek imagination-indeed, everything and anything except me. The invisibility to which I refer occurs because of a peculiar disposition of the eyes of those with whom I come in contact. A matter of construction of their inner eyes, r y ·• ' > ·- SUNIL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer,!.) 581 those eyes with which they look through their physical eyes upon reality .... You wonder whether you are not simply a phantom in other people's minds .... You ache with the need to convince yourself that you do exist in the real world, that you're a part of all the sound and anguish, and you strike out with your fists, you curse and you swear to make them recognise you. And, alas, it is seldom snccessful. In a c•Jlture of Antyodaya, the court must rescue the weakest by pre-emptive guidance without driving parties to post facto litigation. In law as in medicine, prevention is better than cure, a rule jurispru- dents have not sufficiently developed, and so we accede to the request B. of counsel and proceed to discuss the normative side of prison justice. C Before we begin this chapter we might as well set down what the learned Solicitor General stressed viz. that the detailed guidelines set out in the separate opinion in Batra's case (page 488 to 493) are the same as are implicit in the judgment of Desai J. speaking for the other Judges and this position should be re-emphasised by this court here I» so as to avoid misconception. Desai J. has stated Justice Krishna Iyer has delivered an elaborate judgment which deals with important issues raised before us at great length and with great care and concern. We have given a separate opinion, not because we differ with him on funda- mentals, but because we thought it necessary to express our views on certain aspects of the questions canvassed before us. Likewise, in the separate 'judgment, a similar statement is made : I am aware that a splendid condensation of the answers to the core questions has been presented by my learned brother Desai, J and I endorse the conclnsion. A close perusal shows that both the judgments in Batra's case lay down the same rule and the elaborate guidelines in the first opinion are a necessary proliferation of the law expounded in the second judgment in the case. We hold, agreeing with both counsel, that the detailed prescriptions. in the separate opinion in Sunil Batra (p. 488 to 493) is correct law and binds the penal institutions in the country. We agree with these guidelines and express ourselves to that effect since the core question raised in the present case and the cardinal principles we have accepted lead to the same conclnsions. At the outset, we notice the widespread prevalence of legal illi- teracy even among lawyers about the rights of prisoners. Ac<:ess to law postulates awareness of law and activist awareness of legal rights F G F 582 SUPREME COJTRT REPORTS [1980j 2 S.C.R. in the condition for seeking court justice. So the first need in the juristic twilight is for the State to produce and update a handbook on Prison Justice, lucid, legible for the lay, accurate, comprehensive and, above all, practical in meeting the felt necessities and daily problems of prison life. The Indian Bar has, as part of its judicare tryst as a special responsibility to assist the State in this behalf. A useful hand- book prepared by the American Civil Liberties Union was handed upto us by Dr. Chitale titled \"The Rights of Prisoners\". Law in the books and in the courts is of no help unless it reaches the prisoner in under- standable language and available form. We, therefore, draw the ·->tention of the State to the need to get ready Prisoner's Handbook in the regional language and make them freely available to the in- mates. To know the law is the first step to be free from fear of unlaw. Prisoners are peculiarly and doubly handicapped. For one thing, most prisoners belong to the weaker segment, in poverty, literacy, social station and the like. Secondly, the prison house is a walled-off world which is incommunicado for the human world, with the result that the bonded inmates are invisible, their voices inaudible, their injustices unheeded. So it is imperative, as implicit in Art. 21 that life or lib~rty shall not be kept in suspended animation or congealed into animal existence without the freshing flow of air, procedure. The meaning of 'life' given by Field J., approved in Kharak Singh' and Maneka Gandhi' bears exception: Something more than mere animal existence. The in- hibition against its deprivation extended to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. The provision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body by the amputation of an arm or leg, or the putting out of an eye, or the destruc- tion of any other organ of the body through which the soul communicates with the outer world.' Therefore, inside prisons are persons and their personhood, if crippled by law-keepers turning law-breakers, shall be forbidden by the Writ of this Court from such wrong doing. Fair procedure, in dealing with prisoners, therefore, calls for another dimensions of access to law-provision, within easy reach, of the law which limits liberty to persons who are prevented from moving out of prison gates. A handbook meets the logistics of the law in field. Of course, the prison staff also suffer from the pathology of misinformation or non-education about rights and limitations and this ignoratia juris I. Kharak Singh v. The State a/ U.P.

The peril to prison rights is from the uninstructed personnel, apart from the anti- cultural ethos which permeates. It behoves Government to insist on the professional requirement, for warders and wardens, of a hearty .familiarity with the basics of Prison Law. , ~ Rights jurisprudence is important but becomes an abstraction in -< the absence of remedial jurisprudence. Law is not an omnipotence in !' the sky but a loaded gun which, when triggered by trained men with ballistic skill, strikes the offending bull's eye. We have made it clear --1 that no prisoner can be personally subjected to deprivations not neces- sitated by the fact of incarceration and the sentence of court. All other freedoms belong to him to read and write, to exercise and re- ,creation, to meditation and chant, to creative comforts like protection from extreme cold and heat, to freedom from indignities like compul- sory nudity, forced sodomy and other unbearable vulgarity, to move- .men! within the prison campus subject to requirements af discipline and security, to the minimal joys of self-expression, to acqi;ire skills and techniques and all other fundamental rights tailored to the limitations ·of imprisonment. Chandrachud J, long ago, spelt out the position and we affirm it:(') \"Convicts are not, by mere reason of the conviction, denuded of .all the fundamental rights which they otherwise possess. A compulsion under the authority of law, follow- ing upon a conviction, to live in a prison-house entails by its own force the deprivation of fundamental freedoms like the right to move freely throughout the territory of India or the right to 'practise' a profession. A man of profession would thus stand stripped of his right to hold consultations while serving out his sentence. But the Constitution gua- rantees other freedoms like the right tp acquire, hold r.nd dispose of property for the exercise of which incarceration can be no impediment. Likewise, even a convict is entitled to the precious right guaranteed by Article 21 of the Consti- tution that he shall not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\" B c D E F G We think it proper to suggest that in our country of past coloniai -subjection and consequent trepidation in life, publicity officially is H (I) D.

We are dealing with the mechanics of. bringing the Jaw within the wakeful ken of the affected persons. B c D E F G H Sec. 61 of the Prisons Act, simplied imaginatively leads to the· same result. That section reads: \"Copies of rules, under sections 59 and 60 so far as they affect the government of prisons, shall be exhibited, both in English and in the Vernacular, in some place to which all persons employed within a prison have access.\" We think it right to hold that copies of the Prison Manual shall he- kept within ready reach of prisoners. Darkness never does anyone any good and light never any harm. Perhaps, the most important right of a prisoner is to the integrity of his physical person and mental personality. This Court in Batra'S· case has referred to the international wave of torture of prisoners found in an article entitled 'Minds Behind Bars'. That heightens our· anxiety to solve the issue of prisoners' protection. The problem of law, when it is called upon to defend peilions hidden by the law, is to evolve a positive culture and higher conscious~ ness and preventive mechanisms, sensitized strategies and .hnmanist agencies which will bring healing balm to bleeding hearts. Jndeed, counsel on both sides carefully endeavoured to help the Court to evolve remedial processes and personnel within the framework of the Prisons Act and the parameters of the Constitution. · Inflictions Il)l\\y take many protean forms, apart from· physica! assaults. Pushing the prisoner into a solitary cell, denial of a neces- sary amenity, and, more dreadful sometimes, .transfer to a distant pri- son where visits or society of friends or relations may be snapped, allotment of degrading labour, assigning him to a desperate or tough· gang and the like, may be P.unitive ineffect. Every such affliction or abridgment is an infraction of liberty or life in its wider sense and cannot be sustained unless Art. 21 is satisfied. There must be a corrective legal procedure, fair and reasonable and effective. Such· infraction will be arbitrary, under Article 14, if it is dependent on unguided discretion, unreasonable, under Art. 19 if it is irremediable' and unappealable and unfair, under Art. 21 if it violates natural justice.

Likewise, . no personal harm, whether by way of punishment or otherwise, shall be suffered by a prisoner without affording a preven· tive, or in special cases, post facto remedy before a inpartial, com· petent, available agency. . >' . The Court is always ready to correct injustice but it is no practical proposition to. drive every victim to move the court for a writ, know- --- ,._ ing the actual hurdles and the prison realities. True, technicalities and legal niceties are no impediment to the court entertaining even an informal communication as a proceeding for habeas corpus if the basic facts are found; still, the awe and distance of courts, the legalese and mystique, keep the institution unapproachable. More realistic is to devise a method of taking the healing law to the injured victim. That system is best where the remedy will rush to the injury on the sligh· test summons. So, within the existing, dated legislation, new mean· ings must be read. Of course, new legislation is the best solution, but r '). when lawmakers take for too long for social patience to suffer, as in this very case of prison reform, courts have to make-do with interpre- tation and carve on wood and sculpt on stone ready at hand and not wait for far away marble architecture. Counsel rivetted their atten- tion on this pragmatic engineering and jointly helped the court, to constitutionalise the Prisons Act prescriptions. By this legal energe- tics they desired the court to read into vintage provisions legal remedies. Primarily, the prison nuthority has the duty .to given effect to the court sentence. (See for e.g. SS. 15 and 16 of the Prisoners Act, 1900). To give effect to t_he sentence means that it is illegal to exceed it and so it follows that a prison official who goes beyond more imprisonment or deprivation of locomotion and assaults or otherwise compels the doing of things not covered by the sentence acts in viola- tion of Art. 19. Punishments of rigorous imprisonment oblige the inmates to do hard labour, not, harsh la boor and. so a vindictive officer victimisin.g a prisoner by forcing on him particularly harsh and degrad\" ing jobs, violates the law's mandate. For example, a prisoner, if forced to carry night soil, may seek a habeas writ. 'Hard labour' in s. 53 has to receive a humane meaning. A girl student or a male weakling sentenced to rigorous imprisonment may not be forced to break stones for nine hours a day. The prisoner cannot demand soft jobs but may reasonably be assigned congenial jobs. Sense and sym- pathy are not enemies of penal asylllll\\S .. J_G-21 SCI/80 - B c D E F G H A B· c 586 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1980] 2 S.C.R. Section 27(2) and (3) of the Prison.s Act states: 27.

If Kuldip Nayar is right this rule .is in cold storage. It is inhuman and un- reasonable to throw.young boys to the.sex-starved adult pr<soners or to run menial jobs for the affluent or ·tough prisoners. Art. 19 then intervenes and shields. E. F G Section 29 and connected rules relating to solitary confinement have been covered by· Batra's case. But Prem Chand, in this very case, has been sent to a 'solitary' or 'punishment' cell without 11eeding the rulq in Batra's Cll\\e regarding impost of punitive S?)itary confine- me.nt. ·We cannot agree ihat the cell. is not 'solitary' and wonde.r what sadistic delight is derived by the .warders .and wardens by such cruelty. Any harsh is.olation from society by long, lonely, cellular detention is penal and so must be infiicted only consistent)y with fair procedure .. The learned Solicitor General mentioned that some prisoners, for their own safety, may desire segregation. In such cases, written consent and immediate report to higher authority are the least, if abuse is to be tabooed. Visit to prisoners by famJy and friends are a solace in insulation; and only a delmmimised system can derive vicarious delight in depriv- ing prison inmates of this humane amenity. Subject, of course, to search and discipline and other security criteria, the right to society of n ' fellow-men, parents and other family members cannot be denied in the light of Art. 19 and its sweep. Moreover, the whole habi!itative put~ pose of sentencing is to soften, not to harden, and this will be promo- - • - , ... r SUNIL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, J.) 587 ted by more such meetings. A sullen, forlorn prisoner is a dangerous A criminal in the making and the prison is the factory! Sheldon l\\rantz rightly remarks:(') In 1973, the National Advisory Commission argued that prisoners should have a \"right\" to visitation. Task Force Report, Corrections (1973) at 66. It also argued that correctional officials should not merely tolerate visiting but should encourage it, particularly by families. Although the Commission recognised that regulations were necessary to conteud with space problems and with security concerns, it proposed that priority be given to making visiting areas pleasant and unobstrusivc. It also urged that corrections officials should not eavesdrop on conversations or otherwise interfere with the participants' privacy. Thu<, although there may be current limitations on the possible use of the Constitution on visitation by family and friends, public policy should dictate substantial improvements in this area, in any event. We sec no reason why the right to be visited under reasonable res:rictions, should not claim current constitutional status. We hold, subject to considerations of security and discipline, that liberal visits by family members, close friends and legitimate callers, are part of the prisoners' kit of rights and shall be respected. Parole, again, is a subject which is as yet unsatisfactory and arbi- trary but we are not called upon to explore that consf1tutional area and defer it. Likewise, to fetter prisoners in iron is an inhumanity unjustified save where safe custody is otherwise impossible. The routine resort to handculis and irons bespeaks a barbarity hostile to oor goal of human dignity and social justice. And yet this unconsfi- IUtionality is heartlessly popular in many penitentiaries so much so a penitent law must proscribe its use in any but the gravest situation. These rights and safeguards need a machinery. The far internal invigilation and independent oversight cannot be overemphasised. Prisoners' rights and prison wrongs are a challenge to re!lledial crea- tivity.

So, apart from judicial review for prisoners' rights and conditions of confinement, we have to fabricate instant administrative grievance procedures. • - -~ Indeed, a new chapter of offences carrying severe punishments when prison officials become delinquents is an urgent item on the agenda of prison reform; and lodging of complaints of snch offences together with investigation and trial by independent agencies most also >-- find a place in such a scheme. We are dealing with a morbid world where sun and light arc banished and crime has neurotic dimensions. Special situations need special solutions. We reach the most critical phase of counsel's submissions viz., the legal fabrication and engineering of a remedial machinery within the fearless reach of the weakest of victims and worked with indepen- dence, accessibility and power to review and punish. Prison power, absent judicial watch tower, may tend towards torture. The Prisons Act and Rules need revision if a constitutionally and culturally co,ngruous code is to be fa,hioned. The model jail manual, we are unhappy to say and wncur in this view with the learned Soli- citor General, is far from a model and is, perhaps, a product of prison officials insufficiently instructed in the imperatives of the Constitution and unawakened to the new hues of human rights. We accept, for the nonce, the suggestion of the Solicitor General that within the- existing stii\\utory framework the requirements of constitutionalism. may be read. He heavily relies on the need for a judicial agency whose presence, direct or by delegate, within the prison walls will deal with grievances_ For this purpose, he relies on the Board of. Viilitors, their powers and duties, as a functional substitute for a Prison. Ombudsman. A controllerate is the desideratum for in situ reception and redressal of grievances. After all, the daily happenings, when they hurt harshly, have to be arrested forthwith, especially when it is the prison guards and the, head warders who brush with the prison inmates. Their behaviour' often causes friclion and fear but when their doings are impeached, the institutional defence mechanism tends to protect them from top t<> bottom. So much so, injustice escapes punishment. In this context it is apt to quote David Rudovsky: (') (I) The Rights of Prisoners, p. 23. --~ • .... \" • • - SUNJL BATRA v. DELIU ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, J.) 589 The present system puts absolute discretion and day-to- day power over every aspect of a prisoner's life in their hands. It is this part of prison life which causes the deepest resentment among prisoners for, to a large extent, the manner in which an inmate is treated by the guards deter- mines the severity of conditions he will have to endure. It is a double irony that the lower the level of authority in prison (from warden on down to guard) the greater tho discretion that is vested in the prison official and the less willing the courts are to review their decisions. Thus, whe- ther it be a request for medical treatment, the right to go to the yard 01 prison library, or the potentially more serious matter of prison discipline and punishment, the guard of the block holds ultimate power over the prisoner. Com- plet~ discretion in the context of prison Mc where no remedies exist to correct it, can be catastrophic, Judge Sobeloff has put it bluntly: In fact, prison guards may be more vulnerable to the corrupting influence of unchecked authority than most people. It is well known that prisons are operated pn minimum budgets and that poor salaries and working con- ditions make it difficult to attract high-calibre personnel. Moreover, the \"training\" of the officers in dealing with obstreperous prisoners is but a euphemism in most states. George A. Ellis quotes a prisoner's letter : (') You Cllnnot rehabilitate a man through brutality and disrespect. .. If you treat a man like an animal, then you must expect him to act like one. For every action, there is a reaction ... And in order for an inmate, to act like a human being you must trust him as such ..... You can't spit in his face and expect him to smile and say ihank you. The institution and composition of the Board of Visitors comes in handy and has statutory sanction. The visitatiorial power is wide. the panel of visitors includes judicial officers and such a situation ran be pressed into service legally to fulfil the constitutional needs; Para 47 read with para 53-A sets out the structure of the Board Para 47(b); to (d) includes District & Sessions Judges, District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates among the members. The functions of visitors are enumerated in para 53, and 53-B and they include (a) (I) Ro!l<r G. Lampheas Freedom from Crime pp. 28-29. A B C.

In the sensitive area of prison justice, the judicial memben havo special responsibilities and they must act as wholly independent overseers and not as ceremonial panelists. The judges are guardians of prisoners' rights because they have a duty to secure the execution of the sentences without excesses and to sustain the personal liber- ties of iprisoners without violence on or violation of the inmates' personality. Moreover, when a wrong is done inside jail the judicial visitor is virtually a peripatetic tribunal and sentinel, at once intra- mural and extra-mural,-observer, receiver and adjudicator of griev- ance~. What then. are prisoner Prem Chands' rights, in the >pecific set- ting of this .case, where the complaint is that a j<ril warder, for perni- cious purposes, inflicted physical torture ? E The Punjab Prison Manual clearly lays down the duties of District Magistrates with reference to Central Jails. Para 41 ( 1) •and (3) read tbus : 41. (1) It shall be the duty of the Magistrate of the district from time to time to visit and inspect jails situate F within the limits of his district and to satisfy himself that the provisions of the Prisons .Act, 1894, and of all rules, regu- lations, directions and orders made or issued thereunder applicable to such jail, are duly observed and enforced. xx xx xx G ( 3) A record of the result of each visit and mspection made, shall be entered in a register to be maintained by the Superintendent for the purpose. Para 42 is also relevant : 42. In the absence of the Magistrate of the district from H headquarters, or in the event of that officer being at any time unable from any cause to visit the jail in the manner in these rules prescribed in that beh:ill', he shall depute a Magistrate • ,, . ' ------- ' ' ' ). ' SUNIL BATRA V· DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, !.) 591 subordinate to him who is available for the duty, to visit and A inspect the jail on his behalf. Any officer so deputed may, Sltbject to the control of the Magistrate of the district, exer- cise all or any of the powers by the Prisons Act, 1894, or. these rules, conferred upon the Magistrate of the district. Parawaph 44 clothes the District Magistrate with powers and makes B his orders liable to be obeyed. 44. (I) The orders passed under sub-section (2) of section I of the Prisons Act, 1894, should, except in emer- gent cases in which immediate action is, in the opinion of such Magistrate necessmy, be so expressed that the Superin- tendent may have time to refer (if he thinks necessary) to the Inspector-General before taking action thereon. ( 2) All orders issued by the Magistrate of the district shall, if expressed in terms requiring immediate compliance, be forthwith obeyed and a report made, as prescribed in the said sub-section, to the Inspector-GcneraL We understand these provisions to cover the ground of reception of grievance from prisoners and issuance of orders thereon after prompt enquiry. The District Magistrate must remember that in this capacity he is a, judicial officer and not an executive head and must function as such independently of the prison executive. To make prisoners' rights in correctional institutions viable, we direct the Dis- trict Magistrate concerned to inspect the jails in his district once every week receive complaints from individual prisoners and enquire into them immediately. If he is too preoccupied with urgent work, para- graph 42 enables him to depute a magistrate subordinate to him to visit and inspect the jail. What is important is that he should meet the prisoners separately if they have grievances. The presence of warders or officials will be inhibitive and must be avoided. He must ensure that his enquiry is confidential although subject to natural justice and does not lead to reprisals by jail officials. The rule speaks of the record of the result of ~ach visit and inspection. This empowers him to enquire and pass orders. All orders issued by.him shall be imme- diately complied with since obedience is obligated by para 44 (2). Jn the event of non-compliance he should immediately inform Govern- ment about such disobedience and advise the prisoner to forward his complaint to the High Court under Art. 226 together with a copy of his own report to help the High Court exercise its habeas corpus power. Indeed, it will be practical, as suggested by the learned Soli- citor General, if the District Magistrate keeps a grievance box in each c D E F G H 592 'iUPREME COUl;.T REPORTS [1980j 2 S.C.R. A ward to which free access shall be afforded to every inmate. It should be kept locked and sealed by him and on his periodical visit, he alon~, or his surrogate, should open the box, find out the grievances, fovesti- gate ·their merits and take remedial action, if justified. B Chapter V of the Manual deals with visitors who arc an important component of jail management. Para 4 7 sp~cially mentions District . \"'( & Sessions Judges, District Magistrates, Sub-Divisional Magistrates and Superintendents of Police as members of the Board of Visitors. In fact, Sessions Judges are required to visit the jails periodioally-the District Magistrates and Sub Divisional Magistrates and magistrates }- subordinate to them and others appointed by them in this behalf are c D E to visit jails in their jurisdiction once a week under the existing rule. We direct, in implementation of the constitutional obligation we have already discussed at length to safeguard prisoners' fundamental rights, that the Sessions Judges and District Magistrates or. other subordinates nominated by them shall visit jails once a week in their visitorial func- tions. Para 49 has strategic significance and may be reproduced : 49. ( 1) Any official visitor may examine all or any of the books, papers and records of any department of, and may interview any prisoner confined in the jail, (2) It shall be the duty of every official visitor to satisfy himself that the provisions of the Prisons Act, 1894, and of the rules, regulations, orders and directions made or issued thereunder, are duly observed, and to hear and bring to notice any complaint or representation made to him by any F prisoner. We understand this provision to mean that the Sessions Judge, District Magistrate or their nominees shall hear complaints, examine all documents, take evidence, interview prisoners and check to see if there is deviance, disobedience, delinquency or the like which infringes G upon the rights of prisoners. They have a duty \"to hear and bring to notice any complaint or representation made to him by any priso- ner\". Nothing clearer is needed to empcwer these judicial officers to investigate and adjudicate upon grievances. We direct the Sessions Judges concerned, under his lock and seal, to keep a requisite number of grievance boxes in the prison and give necessary directions to the H Superintendent to see that free access is afforded to put in complaints: of encroachments, injuries or torture by any prisoner, where he needs remedial action. Such boxes shall 'not be tampered with by any one • - ' \\ .( ~I .. - • j ' ) SUNIL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer, J.) 593 and shall be opened only under the authority of the Sessions Judge. We need hardly emphasise the utmost vigilance and authority that the Seosions Judge must sensitively exercise in this situation since prisoner's personal liberty depends, in this undetectable campus upon his aware- ness, activism, adjudication aud enforcement. Constitutional rights shall not be emasculated by the insouciance of judicial officers. The prison authorities shall not, ii). any manner, obstruct or non- !\" . cooperate with reception or enquiry into the complaints. Otherwise, prompt punitive action must follow the High Court or the Supreme ··-court must be apprised of the grievance so that habeas corpus may issue after due hearing. Para 53 is important in this context and we reproduce it below : 53. All visitors shall be afforded every facility for observ- ing the state of the jail, arid the management thereof, and shall be allowed access under proper regulations, to all parts of the jail and to every prisoner confined therein. Ewry visitor 5hould have the power to call for and ins· peels auy book or other record in the jail unless the Superin- tendent, for reasons to be recorded in writing, declines on the ground that its production is undesirable. Similarly, every visitor should have the right to see any prisoner and to put MY questions to him out of the bearing of any jail officer. There should be one visitor's book for both classes of visitors, their remarks should in both cases he forwarded to the Ins- pector General who should pass such orders as he thinks necessary, and a copy of the Inspector-General's order should be sent to the visitor concerned. Paras 53-B aud 53-D are not only supplementary but procedurally vital, being protective provisions from the stand-point of prisoners. We except them here for double emphasis although adverted to earlier : 53-B. All visitors, official and non-official, at every visit, shall- ( a) inspect the barracks, cells, wards, workshed Md other buildings of the jail generally aud cooked food; (b) ascertain whether considerations of health, cleanli- A • c E F G ness, and security are attended to, whether proper II management and discipline are maintained in every respect, and whether any prisoner is illegally detained, .A B c D F G H 594 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1980] 2 S.C.R. or is detained for an undue length of time, while awaiting trial; (c) examine jail registers and records; (d) hear, attend to all representations and petitions made, by or on behalf of prisoners; and ( e) direct, if deemed advisable, that any such representa- tions or petitions b~ forwarded to Government. 53-D. No prisoner shall be punished for any. statement made by him to a visitor unless au enquiry made by a Magis- trate results in a finding that it is false. We hope-indeed, we direct-the judicial and other official visitors to live upto the expectations of these two rules and strictly implemellt their mandate. Para 54 is also part of this package oE visitatorial provisions with invigilatory relevance. We expect compliance with these provisions and if the situation demands it, report to the Hi~ Court for. action in the case of a_ny violation of any fundamental right of a prisoner. The long journey through jail law territory proves that a big void exists in legal remedies for prisoner injustices and so constitutional mandates can become living companions of banished humans only if non-traditional procedures, duly oriented personnel and realistic reliefs meet the functional challenge. Broodly speaking, habeas corpus powers and administrative measures are the pillars of prisoners' rilJhis. The former is invaluable and inviolable, but for an illiterate, timorous, indigent inmate community judicial remedies remain frozen. Eve11. so, this constitutional power must discard formalities, dispense with full particulars and demand of the detainer all facts to decide if humane and fair treatment prevails, constitutionally sufficient and comportinc; with the minimum international standards for treatment of prisoners. Publicity within the prison community of court rulings in this area will go a long way to restore the morale of inmates and, hopefully, of the warders. So we direct the Delhi Administration to reach, in Hindi, the essentials of this ruling to the ken of the jail people. The stress that we lay is on the need of the Court to be dynamic and diversified in meeting out remedies to prisoners. Not merely the contempt power but also the power to create ad hoc, and use the services of, officers of justice must be brought into play. In this very case, Dr. Chitale, as amicus curiae, was so authorised, with satiafac- tory results. American juristic thought has considered similar actio11. : by courts using ,.

Hopefully, their use will be expanded ~nd refined over time. c D These measures are needed since the condition is escalating. E The situation in Tihar Jail is a reflection of crime explosion, judi- . cial slow-motion and mechanical police action coupled with nnscientific · negativity and expensive futility of the Prison Administration. The Superintendent wails in court that the conditions are almost unman- ageable: F (i) Huge overcrowding in the jail. Normal population of the jail remains between 2300-2500 against 1273 sanctioned accommodation. (ii) No accommodation for proper classification for undertrials, females, habituals, casuals, juveniles, political prisoners etc. etc. G (iii) Untrained staff of the Assistant Superintendents. Assistant Superintendents are posted from other various departments of Delhi Admn. viz. Sales Tax, Employment, Revenue, Civil Supplies etc., etc. (iv) Untrained mostly the warders guard and their being R non-transferable. (I) p. 273-273 Krantz.

(v) A long distance from the coillis of the jail and pro- duction of a large number of undertrial prisoners roughly between 250-300 daily and their receiving back into the jail in the evening. (vi) The population of the jail having a large number of drugs addicts, habitual pickpockets having regular gangs outside to !ookafter their interests legal and illegal both from outside. Other jails may compete with Tihar to bear the palm in bad treat- ment and so the problem is pan-Indian. That is why we have been. persuaded by the learned Solicitor General to adventure into this un-\\ discovered territory. The Indian Bar, and may be, the Bar Council \"- of India and the academic community, mnst aid the court and country in this Operation Prison Justice. In a democracy, a wrong to some one is a wrong to every one and an unpuhished criminal makes society vicariously guilty. This larger perspective validates our deci- sional range. Before we crystaiise the directions we issue one paramount thought must be expressed. The goal of imprisonment is not only punitive but restorative, to make an offender a non-offender. In Batra' s case this desideratum was stated and it is our constitutiopal law, now impli- cit in Art. 19 itself. Rehabilitation is a prized purpose of prison 'hospitalization'. A criminal mtist be cured and cruelty is not curative even as poking a bleeding wound is not healing. Social justice and . social defence--the sanction behind prison deprivation-ask for en- · lightened habilitative procedures. A leoamed writer has said : The only way that we will ever have prisons that operate with a substantial degree of justice and fairness is when all concerned with that prison--staff and prisoners alike-share in a meoaningful way the decision-making process, share the making of rule and their enforcement. This should not mean three \"snitches\" appointed by the warden to be an \"inmate advisory committee\". However, if we are to instill in people a respect for the democratic process, which is now the free world attempts to live, we are not achieving that by forcing people to live in the most etalitarian institution that we have in our society. Thus, ways must he developed to involve prisoners in the process of making decision that affect every aspect of their life in the prison. The Standard Minimum Rules, put out by United Nations agencies also accent on socialisation of prisoners and social defense : • • • r J -.•. ' SUNIL BATRA V· DELHI ADMINISTRAIION (Krishna Iyer, J.) 597 57. Imprisonment and other measures which result in cutting off an offender from the outside world are afflictive by the very fact of taking from the person the right of self- determination by depriving him of his liberty. Therefore the prison system shall not except as incidental to justifiable segregation or the maintenance of discipline, aggravate the suffering inherent in such a situation. 58. The purpose of justification of a sentence of imprison- ment or a similar measure deprivative of liberty is ultimately to protect society against crime. This end can only be achieved if the period of imprisonment is used to ensure, so far as possible, that upon his return to society the offender is not only willing but able to lead a law-abiding and self supporting life. 59. To this end, the institution should utilize all the reme- dial, educational, moral, spiritual and other forces and forms of assistance which are appropriate and available, and should seek to apply them according to the individual treatment needs of the ·prisoners. Prison-processed rehabilitation has been singularly unsuccessful in A B c D the .West and the recidivism rate in our country also bears similar testi- mony : To get tough, to create mQre tension, to inflict more cruel E punishment, is to promote more stress, more criminality, more des- perate beastliness and is self-defeating though soothing to sadists. Hal- lock, a professor at the University of Wisconsin says : ( 1) .The stresses that lead to mental illness are often the same stresses that lead to crime. Mental illness always has a mal- adaptive quality, and criminality usually has a maladaptive quality. The final panacea for prison injustice is, therefore, more dynamic, far more positive, strategies ·by going back tn man, the inner man. The ward-warden relationship needs holistic repair if prisons are, in Gandhian terms, to become hospitals~ if penology, as modern crimi- nologists claim, is to turn therapeutic. The hope of society from investment in the penitentiary actualises only when the inner man with- in each man, doing the penance of prison life, transforms his outer values !\\Ild harmonises the environmental realities witn the infinite potential of his imprisoned being. Meditative experiments, iollow-up researches and welcome results in many countries lend optimism to (1) Roger G. Lampher_r, Freedom Fron1 Crime p.5 F G H 598 SUPREME COl!RT REPORTS (J 980j 2 S.C.ll..

B c D E • F G H • Jt is of seminal importance to note that the Tamil Nadu Priwn Reforms Commission (1978-79) beaded by a retired Chief Justice of the High Court of Patna, worki\"ng with a team of experts, has rofer- rcd with approval to successful experiments in Transcendental Medi- tation in the Madurai Central Prison : (') Success has been claimed for this programme. It is re- ported that there is \"reduction of anxiety and fear symptoms, greater flexibility in dealing with frustration, increased desire to care for others, and ability to interact in group situations viz. rational rather than purely aggressive means. Some in- mates reported spontaneous reduction in clandestine use of alcohol and ganja; and even cigarette smoking was less. Pri- son authorities informed us that they noticed personality changes in some of these prisoners, and that they now had calm and pleasant exchanges with these inmates. Their be- haviour towards others in the prison and relationship with prison authorities also changed considerably\". There is a proposal to extend this treatment to short term prisoners also. This treatment may also be tried in other prisons where facilities exist. A copy of the report of the Director of the Madurai Institute of Social Work is in Appendix XI. The time for prison reform has come when Indian methodology on these lines is given a chance. We do no more than indicate the sign- post to Freedom From Crime and Freedom Behind Bars as a burgeon- ing branch of therapeutic jurisprudence. All this gains meaning where we recognise that mainstreaming prisoners into community life as will- ing members of a law-abiding society is the target. Rule 61 of the Standard Minimum Rules stresses this factor(') : 61. The treatment of prisoners should emphasize not their exclusion from the community, but their continuing part in it. Community agencies should, therefore, be enlisted wherever possible to assist the staff of the institution in the task of social rehabilitat(on of the prisoners. There should be in connection with every institution social workers charged with the duty of maintaining and improving all desirable rela- tions of a prisoner with his family and with valuable social (1) Vol. 1 pp. 69-70.

Steps should be taken to safeguard, to the minimum extent compatible with the law and the sentence, the rights relating to civil interests, social security rights and other social benefits of prisoners. It follows that social resources, helpful to humane treatment and mainitreaming, should be ploughed in, senior law students screened by the Dean of reputed Law Schools may usefully be deputed to inter- view prisoners, subject to security and discipline. The grievances so gathered can be fed back into the procedural mechanism viz. the Dis• trict Magistrate or Sessions Judge. The Delhi Law School, we indi- cate, should be a\"Uowed to send selected students under the leadership of a teacher not only for their own clinical education but as prisoner- grievance-gathering agency. Other service organisation, with good cre- dentials, should be encouraged, after due checking for security, to play a role in the same direction. The Prifons Act does provide !or rule- maldng and issuance of instructions which can take care of this sug- gestion. Omega A B c The omega of our judgment must take the shape of clear directives E to the State and prison staff by epitomising the lengthy discussion. To clinch the issue and to speN out the precise directions is the next step. 1. We hold that Prem Chand, the prisoner, has been tortured ille- gally and the Superintendent cannot absolve himself from responsibility F even though he may not be directly a party. Lack of vigilance is limited guilt. We do not fix the primary guilt because a criminal case is pend- ing or in the offing. The State shall take action against the investigating police for the apparently collusive dilatoriness and deviousness we have earlier indicated. Policing the police is becoming a new ombudsmanic task of the rule of law. G 2. We direct the Superintendent to ensure that no corporal punish- ment or personal violence on Prem Chand shall be inflicted. No irons shall be forced on the person of Prem Chand in vindictive spirit. In those rare cases of 'dangerousness' the rule of hearing and reasons set H out by this Court in Batra's case and elaborated earlier shall be com- plied with. · • 600 SUPREME COJRT REPORTS [1980] 2 S.C.R.

Grievance Procedure :-This is a very important righ l of a prisoner which does not appear to have been properly considered. The rules regulating the appointment and duties of non-official visitors and official visitors to the prisons have been in force for a long time and their primary functions is \"to visit all parts of the jail and to see all prisoners· and to hear and enquire into any complaint that any prisoner may make\". In practice, these rules have not been very effective in providing a forum for the prisoners to redress their grievances. There are a few non-official visitors who take up their duties conscientiously and listen to the grievances of the prisoners. But most of them take this appointment solely as a post of honour and are somewhat reluctant to record in the · visitor~' book any grievance of a prisoner which might cause embarrassment to the prison staff. The judicial officers, viz., ~-. SUNIL BATRA v. DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Krishna Iyer,!.) 691 the Sessions Judge and the Magistrates who are also ex-officio visitors do not discharge their duties effectively.(1) We insist that the judicial officers- referred to by ns shall carry out their d)lties and responsibilities and serve as an effective grievance mechanism. 6. No solitary or punitive cell, no hard labour or dietary change as painful additive, no other punishment or denial of privileges and ame- nities, no transfer to other prisons with penal consequences, shall be imposed without judicial appraisal of the Sessions Judge and where A such intimation, on account of emergency, is difficult, such information c shall be given within two days of the action. Conclusion What we have sfated and directed constitute the maudatory part of the judgment and shall be complied with by the State. But implicit in · D the discussion and conclusions are certain directives for which we do t not fix any specific time limit except to indicate the urgency of their .,. r implementation. We may spell out four such quasi-mandates. •• 1. The State shall take early steps to prepare in Hindi, a Prisoner's Handbook and circulate copies to bring legal awareness home to the f<. inmates. Periodical jail bulletins stating how improvements and habili- tative progra=es are brought into the prison may create a fellow-ship which will ease tensions. A prisoners' wall paper, which will freely ventilate grievances· will also reduce stress. All these are implementary of s. 61 ef the Prisons Act. 2. The State shall take steps to keep up to the Standard Minimum Rules for Treatment of Prisoners reco=ended by the United Nations, especially those relating to work and wages, treatment with dignity com- munity contact and correctional strategies. In this latter aspect, the observations we have made of holistic development of personality shall be kept in view. 3. The Prisons Act needs rehabilitation and the Prison Manual total overhaul, even the Model Manual being out of focus with healing goals. A correctional-cum-orientation course is necessitous for the prison staff inC'Ulcating the constitutional values, therapeutic aproaches and ll \"l!Sion-free management.

The 'central evil' of prison life, according to this handbook, is \"the unreviewed administrative discretion granted to the poorly trained per- sonnel who deal directly with prisoners. Moreover, even those rights whicll are now guaranteed by the courts are often illusory for many prisoners. Implementation and enforcement of these rights rest pri- Jllarily in the hands of prison officials. Litigation is costly and time- consuming, and few lawyers have volunteered their service in this area. Thus eyen those minimal rights which appear on paper are often in reality ·denied. \" We conclude with the hope that the State, though preoccupied with many pressing problems, will discharge its constitn- tioaal obligation to the invisible mortals incarcerated by it and legisla- tively and administratively re-make a Prison Code adhering to the high vahi~s of the Preamble. Over a hundred years ago (1870) (')- \" .... some American prison administrators assembled to discuss their common problems and founded what is now the American Correctional Association. At the very first meeting, these remarkable men set down a justly famous 'Statement of Twenty-two Principles.\" Among the twenty-two were these : \"Refonnation, not vindictive suffering, should be the pur- pose of the penal treatm.ellf_pf prisoners. The prisoner should be made to realize that his destiny is in his own hands : Prison discipline should be such as to gain the will of the prisoner and conserve his self-respect; The aim of the prison should be to make industrious free men rather than orderly and obedient prisoners.

A cendental meditation and TM-Sidhi Program\" (1) is notable as a practi.- cable project which will reduce the number of prisoners by raising the nature of prisoners. B c In the package of benign changes needed in our prisons with a view to reduce tensions and raise the pace of rehabilitation, we have referred to acclimatization of the community life and elimination of sex vice vis a vis prisoner we have also referred to the unscientific mixing up in practice of under-trials, young offenders and long-term convicts. This point deserves serious attention. A recent book \"Rape in Pri~o11.\" states : (') \"One of the most horrendous aspects of a jail sentence is the fact that not only are the young housed with the older offenders, but those awaiting trial share the same quarters as D convicted inmates. The latter individuals have little to lose in seeking sexual gratification through assault, for they have to serve their time any way ..... As matters now stand, sex is unquestionable the most pertinent issue to the inmates' life behind bars ... There is a great need to utilize the furlough system in corrections. Men with record showing good be- haviour should be released for week ends at home with their families and relatives. F Farewell to this case is not final so far as the jailor and the police investigator are concerned. The former will stand his trial and shall receive justice. We say no more here. The invesitgator invite~ our displeasure and the Assistant Public Prosecutor, whom he consulted, makes us unhappy since we have had a perusal of the case diary. The crime alleged is simple, the material relied on is short and yet, despite repeated observations from the Bench the investigator has delayed dawdily the completion of the collection of evidence and the laying of the charge-sheet. The prisoner who is the victim has been repeatedly questioned under different surroundings and divergent statements are recorded. We do not wish to state what we consider to be the obvious luference, but we are taken aback when the Assistant Public Prosecutor has given an opinion which, if we make presumptions in bis favour, G H (1) KTC Publications, Pam Springs, California, p. xxi.

When offences are alleged to have taken place within the pri- son, there should be no tinge or trace of departmental collusion or league between the police and the prison staff. We make these minimal observations so that the State may be alerted for appropriate action. Surely, the conduct of the prosecution cannot be entrusted to one who has condemned it in advance. \\< • We allow the petition and direct a writ to issue, including the six mandates and further orderJJli!t a copy of it be sent for suitable ac~ion ' co the Ministry of Home AftWs and to all the State Governments smce A B Priron Justice has pervasive relevance. c ... PATHAK, J.-I have read the judgment prepared by my learned brotl1er. For my part, I think it sufficient to endorse the following find- ing and direction detailed towards the end of the judgment : (1) The prisoner, Prem Chand, has been tortured while in cus- tody in the Tihar Jail. As a criminal case is in the offing or may be pending, it is not necessary in this proceeding to decide who is the person responsible for inflicting the tor- ture. (2) The Superintendent of the Jail is directed to ensure that no punishment or personal violence is inflicted on Prem Chand by reason of the complaint made in regard to the torture visited oo him. Besides this, I am in general agreement with my learned brother on the. pressing need for prison reform and the expeditious provision for adequate facilities enabling the prisoners, not only to be acquainted with their legal rights, but also to enable them to record their complaints and grievances, and to have confidential interviews periodically with lawyers nominated for the purpose by the District Magistrate or the Court having jurisdiction subject, of course, to considerations of prison dis- cipline and security. It is imperative that District Magistrates and Sessions Judges should visit the prisons in their jurisdiction and afford effective opportunity to the prisoners for ventilating their grievances and, where the matter lies within their powers, to make expeditious enquiry therein and take suitable remedial action. It is also necessary E G H A B 60i SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1980] 2 S.C.R.' that the Sessions Judge should be informed by the jail authorities of any punitive actiO'll taken against a prisoner within two days of such action.
