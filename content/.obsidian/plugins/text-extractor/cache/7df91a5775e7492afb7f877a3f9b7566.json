Civil Appeal No. 1178 of 1988t ansmg out of SLP (C) No. 2009 of 1987, decided on March 24, 1988 Arbitration Act. 1940 -- Srctions 20 and 8 - Existence of dispute e~flential for applicability of - Dispute when arises Arbitration Act, 1 '>40 - Section 20 - Period of limitation for making application under - Article 137 of Limitation Act, applicable - Right to apply accrues for the purpo~cs of Article 137 when dispute between the parties al'ises - Dispute regarding payment of bill in works contract arises when there is a claim and denial or repudiation thereof - Date of completion of the contract when the contractor only becomes entitled to the pa}ment, in absence of element of dispute, is not the date of accrual of right to apply - Limitation Act, 1963, Article 137 - Contracts Held: The existence of dispute is essential for appointment of an arbitrator under Section 8 or a reference under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act. There can be a dispute only when a claim is asserted by one party and denied by the other on whatever grounds. Mere failure or inaction to pay does not lead to the inference of the existence of dispute. Disputes entails a positive element. Whether in a particular case a dispute has arisen or not has to be found out from the facts and circumstanceb. of the case. Though a party cannot postpone the accrual of cause of action by sending remmders but where the bill had not been finally prepared, the claim made by a claimant is the accrual of the cause of action. (Para 4) Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would apply to any petition or application filed in a civil court. Therefore, Article 137 will apply to application filed under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act. The pe1icd of 3 years prescribed under Article 137 will start from the date when the right to apply accrued. Though in works contract on completion of the -vork a right to get payment would normally arise but that is not enough for a 1eference under Section 20. Where the final bills had not been prepared and the assertion of the claim was made on February 28, 1983 and there was non-payment, the cause of action arose from that date, i.e. February 28, 1983. As the application under Section 20 was filed in court in January 1986, i.e. within the period of three years, the application was within time.

Amson and Besom, Kerala, (1976) 4 SCC 634: (1977) 1 SCR 996, relied on Appeal allowed R-M/8'568/C Advocates who appeared in this case: Hardev Singh, Senior Advocate (Miss MaJhu Moolchanclar.i, Advocate, with him), for the Appellant ; S. B. Saharya, V. B. Saharya and Ratna Nain, Advocate'i, for th~ Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J.-Special leave granted. 2. The Delhi Development Authority vide its letter dated October 5, 1976 accepted the tender of the appellant for construction of 240 Janta Houses at the estimated co'it of Rs 24,49.262. The work was to commence on October 15, 1976 and was required to be completed by July 14, 1977. By a subsequent extension of time the work was finally completed on April 2, 1980 and the houses so constructed have been allotted to several people. Between February J 983 to December 1985 the appellant sent several letters to the respondent requesting them to finalise the bills. It appears, however, that the first of such letters was written on February 28, 1983. There- after the appellant wrote several letters and finally on Septemher 4, 1985 to the respondent to finalise the bills and ultimately sened the notice through his counsel requesting it to release the security of Rs 1 lakh and refer the dispute to arbitration. The respondent failed to do so. In January 1986 the appeJlant filed an app1ication under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 (hereinafter called 'the Act') seeking a direction from the court that the respondent be directed to fi1e the arbitration agreement in the court and the dispute be referred to the arbitration. The learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi dismissed the application as barred by time. There was an appeal to the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi. The Division Bench upheld the decision of the learned Single Judge. Hence this appeal to this Court. 3. The question is, whether the High Court was right in uphold- jng that the application under Section 20 of the Act was barred hy limitation. In view of the decision of this Court in Kera/a State Electricity Board v. T. P. K. K. Amsom and Besom, Kerala1, it is now well settled that Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would apply to any petition or application filed in a civil court. Sub- section ( 1) of Section 20 of the Act provides as follows : 1.

Application to file in court arbitration agreement.- - ( 1) Where any persons have entered into an arbitration agreement before the institution of any suit with respect to the subject-matter of the agreement or any part of it, and where a difference ha~ arisen to which the agreement applies, they or any of them, instead of proceeding under Chapter II, may apply to a court having jurisdiction in the matter to which the agreement relates, that the agreement be filed in court. 4. Therefore, in order to be entitled to order o;f reference under Section 20, it is necessary that there should be an arbitration agreement and secondly, difference must arise to which this agreement applied. In this case, there is no dispute that there was an arbitration agreement. There has been an assertion of claim bv the appellant and si1ence as well as refusal in respect of the same by resoondent. Therefore, a dispute has arisen regarding non-payment of the afleged dues of the aopellant. The question is for the Present case when did c;uch dispute arise. The High Court proceeded on the basis that the work was completed in 1980 and, therefore, the appellant became entitled to the pavment from that date and the cause of action under Article 137 arose from that date. But in order to be entitled to ask for a reference under Section 20 of the Act there must not onlv be an entitlement to monev but there must be a difference or dispute must arise. It is true that on completion of the work a rfo-ht to ~et navment would normaUv arise but where the final bills as in this case have not been preoared as aupears from the record and when the assertion of the claim was made on February 28, 1983 and there was non-payment, the cause of action arose from that date, that is to say, Februarv 28, 1983. Jt is also true that a party cannot postpone the accrual of cause of action bv writing reminders or sending reminders but where the hi11 had not been finally prepared, the claim made by a claimant is the accrual of the cause of action. A disoute arises where there is a claim and a denial and reoudiation of the claim. The existence of dispute is essential for aooointment of an arbitrator under Section 8 or a reference under Section 20 of the Act. See Law of Arbitration bv R. S. Bachawat. first edition, oage 354. There should be disuute and there can only be a disoute when a cJaim is asserted by one partv and denied bv the other on whatever grounds. Mere failure or inaction to pay does not lead to the inference of the existence of dispute. Dispute entails a positive element and assertion of denying, not merely inaction to accede to a claim or a request. Whether in a particular case a dispute has arisen or not has to be found out from the facts and circumstances of the case. 5. The application under Section 20 of the Act was filed in court in January 1986, that is to say, within the period of three yl:'ars ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(Para 3) The family of the respondent-landholder consisted of njne members including himself viz. the landholder, his mother, his wife, his three minor 5ons and his three minor daughters. In asccrtainmg whether or not family consists more than fhc members it is not sufficient to have regard only to the members of the family belonging to the specified category namely minor sons, apart from the landholder and his w1te.
