We are not convinced that a mere contract agreeing to a quota of promotions can be exalted into a service rule or statutory duty. What is immediately relevant is not whether the respondent is State or public authority but whether what is enforced is a statutory duty or sovereign obligation or public function of a public authority. Private law may involve a State, a statutory body, or a public body in contractual or tortious actions. But they cannot be siphoned off into the writ jurisdiction. 12. The controversy before us in substance will tum on the construction and scope of the agreement when the claim to a quota as founded cannot be decided in writ jurisdiction without going bark on well-settled guidelines and even subverting the normal processuai law - except perhaps in extreme cases which shock the conscience of the Court or other extraordinary situation, an aspect we are not called upon to explore here. We are aware of the wide amplitude of Article 226 and its potent me to correct manifest injustice but cannot agree that contractual obligations in the ordinary course, without even ~tatutory complexion, can be enforced by his short, though, wrong cut. 13.

ABDULBHAI FAIZULLABHAI 833 four of the several establishments had more than 20 workmen, Ex gratia payments of small amounts were however being paid for several years to such workmen till 1965, when it stopped. There was an association of employers and a union of the workers. The matter of bonus was raised by the union leading to appointment of Board of Arbitrators. The arbitral board rejected the demand and such furtner payments were discontinued. Matter was ultimately referred to the Industrial Tribunal. The terms of reference were : 1. Whether the establishments have been giving bonus to their workmen till 1965? If so, how long before 1965 have the employers been giving bonus to their workmen ? And at what rate ? 2. Whether the payment of bonus by the employers to their workmen has become custom or usage or condition of service in these establishments ? If so, what should be the basis on which employers should make paymenl of bonus to their workmen for the years ending on any date in 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969? The tribunal made short shrift of the matter by holding the reference barred by res judicata and hence untenable. Hence the appeal by special leave. Preliminary objection was taken on behalf of the respondent employers that the union could not be the appellant since the dispute was between the workers and the ec;tablishments. Counsel on behalf of the respondents besides ra1smg the plea of res judicata pleaded that the claim being for profit-based bo11us it was clearly impermissible under the Bonus Act since all but four of the e\"tablishments employed less than 20 workmen.

When industrial jurispntdence speaks of 'bonus', it enters the area of right and claim to what is due beyond strict wages. So that if the Bonus Act deals wholly and solely with profit bonus, it cannot operate as a bar to a different species of claim merely because the word bonus is common to both. (Para 24) A study of history and background of the Bonus Act, 1965 shows that the paramount purpose of the Payment of Bonus Act was to regulate profit bonus, with incidental incursions into other allied claims like customary or attendance bonus. If such be the design of the statute, its scheme cannot be stretched to supersede what it never meant to touch or tackle. The conclusion is that the Bonus Act dealt with only profit bonus and matters connected therewith and did not govern customary, traditional or contractual bonus. (Paras 25 to 36) The Bonus Act speaks, and speaks as a whole code, on the sole subject of profit-based bonus but is silent on. and cannot therefore annihilate by implica- tion, other distinct and different kinds of bonus such as the one oriented on custom. There is no categorical prov1s1on in the Bonus Act nullifyin~ all other kinds of bonus, nor does such a conclusion arise by necessary implication. (Paras 37 and 38) S411ghi J•t1varaj GhtJwar Chand v.

Likewise, reference to agreements and settlements providing for bonus being exempted from the applicability of the Act does not militate against the survival of contractual bonus (subject of course to impact of amendment by the 1975 ordinance).

The J udgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNA IYER, J.-A narration of the skeletal facts, sufficient to get a hang of the four legal issues debated at the Bar in this appeal, by special leave, will help direct the discussion along a disciplined course, although the broader social arguments addressed have ,;;pilled over the banks of the jural stream. 2. Nag Devi, a locality in the city of Bombay, is studded with small hardware businesses where pipes and fittings, nuts and bolts, tools and other small products, are made and/ or sold. These establishments, well over a thousand, employ a considerable number of workmen in the neighbourhood of 5000, although each unit has (barring four), less than the statutory minimum of 20 workmen. This heavy density of under- takings and workers naturally produced an association of employers and a union of workmen, each recognising the other, for the necessary con- venience of collective bargaining. Apparently, these hardware merchants huddled together in the small area, were getting on well in their business and in their relations with their workmen, and this goodwill manifested itself in ex gratia payments to them of small amounts for a number of years prior to 1965, when trouble began. 3. Although rooted in goodness and grace, the annual repetition of these payments ripened, in the consciousness of the workers, into a sort of right - nothing surprising when we see in our towns and temples a trek of charity-seekers claiming benevolence as of right from shopkeepers and pilgrims. especially when this kindly disposition ha~ been kept up over long years. The compassion of yesterdav crystallises as the claim of today, and legal right begins a'i that which is humanistically right. Anyway, the hardware merchant'i of Nag Devi. made of sterner stuff, in the year J 965. abruptlv declined to pav the goodwi11 sums of the spread-out past and the frmtrated workmen frowned on this stoppage by setting up a right to bonuc;; averring con,iderable profit~ for the industry ( if one may con- venientlv use that cxprec;;sion for a collective coverage of the conglomeration of hardware ec;;tablishments).

The Deputy Commissioner of Labour mediated but since his intervention did not melt the hardened mood of the employers, formal demands for payment of bonus were made by the union and govern- ment was persuaded to refer the dispute for adjudication to an industrial tribunal. The tribunal formulated two issues as arising from the statements of the parties and rendered his award dismissing the reference. 4. At this stage, it may be useful to set out the terms of reference made under Section 10(1) (d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short, the I. D. Act), for adjudication by the tribunal : 1. Whether the establishments (mentioned in the annexure) have been giving bonus to their workmen till 1965? If so, how long before 1965 have the employers been giving bonus to their workmen ? And at what rate? 2. Whether payment of bonus by the employers to their workmen has become custom or usage or condition of service in these establishments ? If so, what should be the basis on which employers should make payment of bonus to their workmen for the years ending on any date in 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969? Following upon the statements of parties, the tribunal framed two issues which ran thus : 1. Whether the Award of the Arbitration Board made in Reference (VA) No. 1 of 1967 and published in M . G.G. Part 1-1 dated October 31, 1968, pages 4259-4286, operates as res judicata to the ctemands of the workmen. 2. Whether the reference in respect of the demands is tenable and legal. He answered the first in the affirmative and the second in the negative. 5. The union, representing the workers in the mass, has assailed the findings of the tribunal, the reasonings he has adopted and the mis- direction he has allegedly committed. The tribunal did not enter the merits of the claim but dismissed it in limine on the score that the demand for bonus was barred by res judicata, the arbitral board's decision negativing the bonus for 1965 being the basis of this holding. The second ground for reaching the same conclusion was that the Bonus Act was a compre- hensive and exhaustive law dealing with the entire subject of bonus and its beneficiaries. In short, in his view, the Bonus Act was a complete code and no species of bonus could survive outside the contours of that statute. Admittedly, here the claim for bonus for the relevant four years was founded on tradition or custom or condition of service and, in that light, the tribunal made short shrift of the workmen's plea in these words : In my opinion, the demand pertaining to the practice or custom prevailing in the establishments before 1965 is not such a matter as has to be adjudicated and it also does not fall under the provisions of Bonus Act. I, therefore, find that the reference in that respect also is not tenable and legal. 6. The submissions of Counsel may be itemised into four contentions which may be considered seriatim. They are : (a) Was the industrial tribunal competent to entertain the dispute at all ? (b) Was the claim for bonus for the years 1966-69 barred by res judicata '! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(d) If answer to (c) is in favour of the workmen, does the Bonus Act interdict such a demand since it does not provide for those categories of bonus and confines itself to profitbased bonus, or does the Bonus Act speak on the topic of bonus of all species and, therefore, stands foursquare between a claim for bonus and its grant, unless it finds statutory expression in the provisions of that Act? The first contention which, curiously enough, has appealed to the industrial tribunal, need not be investigated as it is devoid of merit and has rightly been given up by Counsel for the respondent. A casual perusal of the provisions bearing on the jurisdiction of the labour court and the industrial tribunal as well as the relevant schedules wi11 convince anyone that this industrial dispute comes within the wider ambit of the industrial tribunal's powers. It is unfortunate that the tribunal has made this palpable error. It is right to give plausible reasons for one's verdict and not mar it by bad, perfunctory supplementaries. 7. Fairness to respondent's Counsel constrains us to consider in limine a flawsome plea forcibly urged that the union figured as the appellant before us but being no party to the dispute ( which was between the workers on the one hand and the establishments on the other) had no locus standi. No right of the union qua union was involved and the real disputants were the workers. Surely, there is terminological lapse in the cause title because, in fact, the aggrieved appellants are the workers collectively, not the union. But a bare reading of the petition, the description of parties, the grounds urged and grievances aired, leave us in no doubt that the battle is between the workers and employers and the union represents, as a collective noun, as it were, the numerous humans whose presence is indubitable in the contest, though formally invisible on the party array. The substance of the matter is obyious and formal defects, in such circumstances, fade away. We are not dealing with a civil litigation governed by the Civil Procedure Code but with an industrial dispute where the process of conflict resolution is informal, rough-and- ready and invites a liberal approach. Procedural prescriptions are hand- maids, not mistresses, of justice and failure of fair play is the spirit in which courts must view processua] deviances. Our adjectival branch of jurisprudence. by and large, deals not with 5.ophisticated litigants but the rural poor, the urban Jay and the weaker societal segments for whom law wiB be an added terror if technical misdescriptions and deficiencies in drafting pleadings and setting out the cause title create a secret weapon to non-suit a party. Where foul play is absent, and fairness is not faulted, latitude is a grace of processua] justice. Test litigations, representative actions. pro bono p11blico and like broadened forms of legal proceedings are in keeping with the current accent on justice to the common man and a necessary disincentive to those v.• ho wish to bypass the real issues on the merits by suspect reliance on peripheral, procedural shortcomings.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 838 SUPREME COURT CASES (1976) 3 sec promoted by a spacious construction of locus standi in our socio-economic circumstances and conceptual latitudinarianism permits taking liberties with individualisation of the right to invoke the higher courts where the remedy is shared by a considerable number, particularly when they are weak.er. Less litigation, consistent with fair process, is the aim of adjectival law. Therefore, the decisions cited before us founded on the jurisdiction under Article 226 are inept and themselves somewhat out of tune with the modern requirements of jurisprudence calculated to benefit the com- munity. Two rulings of this Court more or less endorse this general approach: Dabholkar1 and Newabganj Sugar Mills'. 8. All this apart, we are dealing with an industrial dispute which, in some respects, lends itself to more informality especially in the matter of union representation. Technically, the union cannot be the appellant, the workmen being the real parties. But the infelicity of drafting notwith- standing, the union's role as merely representing the workers is made clear in the description of the parties. Learned Counsel took us through Section 36(1) and (4) of the Act, Rules 29 and 36 of the Central Rules under that Act, Section 15(2) of the Payment of Wages Act and some rulings throwing dim light on the rule regarding representation in industrial litigation. We deem it needless to go deeper into this question, for in industrial law, collective bargaining, union representation at conciliations, arbitrations, adjudications and appellate and other proceedings is a welcome development and an enlightened advance in industrial life. 9. Organised labour, inevitably involves unionisation. Welfare of workers being a primary concern of our Constitution (Part IV), we have to understand and interpret the new norms of procedure at the prelitigative and litigative stages, conceptually recognising the representative capacity of labour unions. Of course, complications may arise where inter-union rivalries and kilkenny cat competitions impair the peace and solidarity of the working class. It is admitted, in this case, that there is only one union and so we are not called upon to visualize the difficult situations Counsel for the respondents invited us to do, where a plurality of unions pollute workers' unity and create situations ca.uing for investigation into the representative credentials of the party appearing before the tribunal or court. It is enough, on the facts of this case, for us to take the union as an abbreviation for the totality of workmen involved in the dispute, a convenient label which, for reasons of expediency, converts a lengthy party array into a short and meaningful one, group representation through unions being familiar in collective bargaining and later litigation. We do not expect the rigid insistence on each workman having to be a party eo nomine. The whole body of workers, without their names being set out, is, in any case, sufficient, according to the Counsel for the respondents, although strictly speaking, even there an amount of vagueness exists. For these reasons, we decline to frustrate this appeal by acceptance of a subversive technicality. We regard this appeal as one by the workmen compendiously projected and impleaded through the union.

But we will deal with it last, as was don~ by Counsel, and so straight to the piece de resistance of this lis. Points ( b) and (c) bearing on bonus therefore claim our first attention and, in a sense, are integrated and amenable to common discussion. 11. Shri G. B. Pai, appearing for the respondents, contended that the claim put forward by the appellant before the tribunal was, on the face of it, unsustainable on the short ground that what was pleaded was profit-based bonus only and, therefore, fell squarely within the Bonus Act. That Act being a complete code, it expressly excluded by Section 1 ( 3) all establishments employing less than 20 workmen and al] but four of the respondents were admittedly such small undertakings, with the result that the death knell to the plea of bonus was tolled by the Act itself. Therefore, the conclusion was irresistible, argued Counsel for the respondents, that the plea for a profit-based bonus, being negatived by the statute, stands self-condemned. 12. This argument drives us into an enquiry as to whether the claim before the tribunal was for profit-based bonus. 'Yes' was his holding, and so he said 'no' to the workmen. The answer is the same, if the claim is founded on a similar basis. 13. Shri Tarkunde, for the appellant, countered this seemingly fatal submission by urging, that whatever might have been the species of bonus demanded in 1965, the present dispute referred by the State Government related to a totally different type of bonus, namely, customary bonus or one which was a term of employment itself. Even if this be true, Shri G. B. Pai has his case that the Bonus Act is all-comprehensive and no kind of bonus can gain legal recognition if it falls outside the sweep and scope of the Bonus Act itself. No brand of bonus has life left if it does not find a place in the oxygen tent of the complete code called the Bonus Act. 14. What thus first falls for our examination is the reference by the State Government to the tribunal, the pleading of the workmen before the tribunal and the counter statement by the employers before the tribunal with a view to ascertain the character of the bonus demanded by the workers and covered by the dispute. It must be remembered that the award has rejected the claim not substantively but on the ground of two legal bars and care must be taken not to mix up maintainability with merits. A short cut is a wrong cut oftentimes and the tribunal's easy recourse to dismissal on preliminary grounds may well lead - and it has, as will be presently perceived - to a reopening of the case many years later if the higher court reverses the Jega] findings. Be that as it may, let us test the validity of the plea that only a profit-based bonus has been claimed by the workers. 15. The demands referred by the State Government under Section l 0(1) (d) specifically speak of payment of bonus by the employers which 'has become custom or usage or a condition of service in the establish- ments'. The subsidiary or rather consequential point covered by the refe- rence is 'if so, what should be the basis on whij::h employers should make ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It is plain that the subject-matter of the dispute, as referred by the Government, deals with bonus based on custom or condition of service. The tribunal is therefore bound to investigate this question, the terms of reference being the operational basis of its jurisdiction. 16. The workmen, in their statement, have asserted that bonus had been paid for several years and what transpired at the conciliation stages is clear from the letter of the Commissioner of Labout who adverts to the •usual custom and practice of payment of bonus'. The colour of the workers' claim has been clarified further in paragraphs 10 to 12 of their statement before the tribunal. While they do mention that the hardware merchants of Nag Devi have been making large profits during the years in question and, therefore, can afford to pay bonus according to the stan- dards and criteria applicable to large and prosperous industrial establish- ments, the real foundation of their claim is set out in indubitable langu- age as attributable to 'custom, usage and condition of service'. Surely, they have no case of bonus dependent upon the quantum of profits of the establishments nor of uniformity regionwise. On the other hand, the amount of bonus, the time of payment, etc. vary from establishment to establishment. The constant factor, however, is allegedly that there is 'consistency, predictability and uniformity', continuity and payment 'without reference to the fluctuations in the financial performance and profits of each firm'. The Sabha does not mince words when, in praying for relief, it states that the tribunal 'be pleased to restore the custom, usage and conditions of service represented by the payment of bonus in these firms'. In short, the bedrock of the bonus claim of the workers is custom and usage and/ or implied condition of service. Nor have the establishments, who are the respondents before the tribunal and before us, made any mistake about the nature of the demand. In their statement before the tribunal they have urged that a scrutiny of the accounts of the firms is unnecessary 'since the demand is not based on the profits or the financial results of the employers but is based on custom'. The contentions of the Sabha that the conditions of service under all these employers should be governed by one standard and one criteria, 1s not tenable. Since all the shops are not owned by one person and since every shop is a different entity there is no question of uniformity of service conditions. Moreover, there is no law which lays down that the service conditions of the employees under all these employers should be uniform. It is submitted that the reference to the capita-turn- over ratio in this paragraph is irrelevant. It is also submitted that the Sabha's demand that a sample scrutiny of the accounts of the tirms should be made by the tribunal is irrelevant in this respect since the demand is not based on the profit!> or the financial results of the employers but is based on custom. Moreover, ex gratia payments for the pre-Bonus Act period are admitted by the respondents. They seek sanctuary in the counter-plea that free acts of grace, even if repeated, can neither amount to a custom, usage or condition of service. In sum, a study of the pleadings, the term of refe- rence and the surrounding circumstances supports the only conclusion that, peripheral reference to the profits of the establishments notwithstand- ing, the core of the cause of action or the kernel of the claim for bonus ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Pai did urge that the precedents of this Court have linked custom-based bonus with some festival or other and that bonus founded on custom de hors some festival is virtually unknown to case- law on the point. From this he argues that 5-ince the bonus has not been related by reference to any festival by the workmen in their pleadings (reference to Diwali as the relevant festival in the statement of the case in this Court is an ingenious innovation to fit into the judge-made law, according to Shri Pai) the claim must fail. Legal life is breathed into customary bonus only by nexus with Puja or other festival. We are un- able to agree with this rather meretricious submission. Surely, communal festivals are occasions of rejoicing and spending and employers make bonus payments to employees to help them meet the extra expenses their fami- lies have to incur. Ours is a festival-r.i,dden society with many religions contributing to their plurality. That is why our primitive practice of link- ing payment of bonus with some distinctive festival has sprouted. As we progress on the secular road, maybe the Republic Day or the Indepen- dence Day or the Founder\"s Day may well become the occasion for custo- mary bonus. The crucial question is not whether there is a festival which buckles the bonus and the custom. What is legally telling is whether by an unbroken flow of annual payments a custom or usage has flowered, so that a right to bonus based thereon can be predicated. The custom itself precipitates from and is proved by the periodic payments induced by the sentiment of the pleasing occasion, creating a mutual consciousness, after a ripening passage of time, of an obligation to pay and a legitimate expecta- tion to receive. We are, therefore, satisfied that the omission to mention the name of a festival, as a matter of pleading, does not detract from the claim of customary bonus. The impact of this omission on proof of such cm,tom is a different matter with which we are not concerned at this stage since the tribunal has not yet enquired into the merits. 18. Shri Pai urged that the custom, even if true, stood broken in 1965 and, therefore, during the post-1965 period, customary bonus stood extinguished. The effect of the arbitral board's negation of the profit- based bonus claim in 1965 on custom-based bonus for the subsequent period is again relevant, if at all, as evidence, which falls outside our consideration at present. In the event of the tribunal having to adjudi- cate upon the question, maybe this rather anaemic circumstance will be urged by the employer and explained by the employees. 19. There is hardly any doubt that custom has been recognised in the past as a source of the right to bonus, as the several decisions cited before us by Shri Tarkunde make out and Section 17 (a) of the Bonus Act, in a way, recognizes ~uch a root of title.

Vaidialingam, J. in Churakulam referring to some of the precedents, observed : lo lspabani's case this Court had to consider a claim for Puja bonus, in Bengal, and the essential ingredients, for sustaining such a claim when it is based on an implied agreement. After stating that the claim, for Puja bonus, can be based either as a matter of implied agreement between the employers and employees, creating a term of employment for payment of Puja bonus, or that even where no implied agreement can be inferred, it may be payable as a customary bonus, this Court, in the said decision, specifically dealt with a claim for payment of bonus as an implied condition of service. This Court further accepted as correct the tests laid down by the appellate tribunal in Mabalaxmi Cotton Mills Ltd., Calcutta v. Mabalumi Cotton Mills Worken' Union5 for inferring that there is an implied agreement for grant of such bonus. The three circumstances, laid down by the appellate tribunal, were : (I) that the payment must be unbroken ; (2) that it must be for a sufficiently long period; and (3) that the circumstances, in which payment was made should be such as to exclude that it was paid out of bounty. This Court, again, had had to consider the essential ingredients to be estab- lished when payment of bonus, as customary or traditional, is claimed - again related to a festival - in Graham Trading Co. (India) Ltd, v. Its Workmen6 and dealt with the question as follows : In dealing with Puja bonus based on an implied term of employment, it was pointed out by us in Messn. Ispabani Ltd. v. Ispahani Employees' Union that a term may be implied, even though the payment may not have been at a uniform rate throughout and the industrial tribunal would be justified in deciding what should be the quantum of payment in a particular year taking into account the varying payments made in preyious years. But when the question of customary and traditional bonus arises for adjudica- tion, the considerations may be somewhat different. In such a case, the tribunal will have to consider: (i) whether the payment has been over an unbroken series of years ; (ii) whether it has bee~ for a sufficiently long period though the length of the period might depend on the circumstances of each case; even so the period may normally have to be longer to justify an inference of traditional and customary Puja bonus than may be the case with Puja bonus based on an implied term of employment ; (iii) the circum- stance that the payment depended upon the earning of profits would hav~ to be excluded and therefore it must be shown that payment was made in years of loss. In dealing with the question of custom, the fact that the payment wm; called ex gratia by the employer when it was made, would, however, make no difference in this regard bt:cause the proof of custom depends upon the effect of the relevant factors enumerated by us; and it would not be materially affected by unilateral declarations of one party when the said declarations arc inconsistent with the course of conduct adopted by it ; and (iv) the payment must have been at a uniform rate throughout to justify an inference that the payment at such and such rate had become customary and traditional in the particular concern. It will be seen that these tests are in substance more stringent than tests applied for proof of Puja bonus as an implied term of employment. It will be seen from the above extract that an addition,11 circumstance has also been insisted upon, in the case of customary or traditional bonus; that the payment must have been at a uniform rate throughout to justify an inference that the payment at such and such a rate had hecome customary and traditional in the particular concern.

The learned Judge discussed Jardine Henderson 8 and other rulings, but the judicial chorus of legally claimable customary or contractual bonus is not marred by any discordant note. 21. It may be otiose to refer to holdings of High Co'brt when this Court has laid down the law. Even so, two decisions, one of Patina and the other of Calcutta, deserve mention. One of us, (Untwalia, J. as he then was) speaking for the Division Bench, observed in Howrah-Amta Light Rly. 9 thus : Apart from the profit bonus, the sense of social justice has led to the recog- nition in law of the right of the workmen to get other kinds of bonus which do not depend upon nor are necessarily connected with the earnings of profits by the industrial concern. One such kind of bonus is that which is paid on the occasion of special festival well celebrated in particular parts of India, as for example, Puja bonus in Bengal and Divali bonus in Western India. The Court, referring to Tulsidas Khimji 10 restated the tests for the claim of customary bonus and rightly held that these tests are but circumstances and not conditions precedent, that it is not necessary to show that such bonus has been paid even in years of loss. The grounds to be made out for customary, as distinguished. from contractual, bonus overlap in many respects but differ in some aspects. 22. Justice P. B. Mukharji, as he then was, in Tilak Co.\" observed : Akin to this conception of bonus is the case of a bonus annexed to the employ- ment by custom or social practices such as customary bonus and Puja or festivity bonus. In case of such customary and traditional bonus, the question of profit may or may not arise at all and ,uch cu<;tomary and traditional bonus will depend on the content and termc; of that cuc;tom or the tradition on which the claim for bonus is made. Each claim for bonus must depend on the facts of such claim. No doctrinaire view about bonus is possible or desirable. This much however is judicially settled that bonus is not deferred wages. It ic; a narrow and static view that considers bonus as always an ex gratia payment or a glorified tip or 'bakshish' or a mere cash patronage payable at the pleasure of the employer. In the industrial juris- prudence or a modern economic society, it is a legal claim and a legal category, who,c potentialities are not as yet fully conceived, but who-;e types and boundaries the courts in India are struggling to formulate. It is a vital instrument of industrial peace and progress, dynamic in it!> implication and operation. Since we are not called upon to investigate the veracity of the claim we stop with stating that the employers' awareness of social justice, which fertilises the right of his employees for bonus, blooms in many ways of which, profit- based bonus is but one - not the only one. All this is the indirect bonanza of Part IV of the Constitution which bespeaks the conscience of the nation, including the community of employers.

Law is not always an organiser of one-way traffic. 23. This general survey of the case-law conclusively makes out that Labour's claim for bonus is not inflexibly and solely pegged to profit as the one and only right. Bonus is a word of many generous connotations and, in the Lord's mansion there are many houses. There is profit-based bonus which is one specific kind of claim and perhaps the most common. There is customary or traditional bonus which has its emergence from long, continued, usage leading to a promissory and expectancy situation material- ising in a right. There are attendance bonus, production bonus and what not. An examination of the totality of pertinent materials drives us to the inevitable result that what has been claimed by the workmen in the present case is bonus based on custom and service condition - not one based on profit. But the critical question pops up : Is the Bonus Act a killer of every other kind of bonus not provided for by it ? 24. We have thus to move on to a study of the scheme of the Bonus Act in order to ascertain whether it extinguishes claims founded on custo- mary bonus or contractual bonus. In one sense, a bonus may be a mere gift or gratuity as a gesture of goodwill or it may be something which an employee is entitled to on the happening of a condition precedent and is enforceable when the condition is fulfilled . Any extra consideration given for what is received, or something given in addition to what is ordi- narily received by, or strictly due to the recipient is a bonus (B/ack's Legal Dictionary). But when industrial jurisprudence speaks of ·bonus', it enters the area of right and claim to what is due beyond strict wages. Viewed from this angle, prima facie one is led to the conclusion that if the Bonus Act deals wholly and solely with profit bonus, it cannot operate as a bar to a different species of claim merely because word bonus is common to both. Of course, if the statute has spoken so comprehensively, as it can, effect must be given to it. 25. The cosmos of bonus is expanding as working class contentment and prosperity become integral components of industrial peace and pro- gress. The bone of contention between the parties before us is as to whether the Bonus Act is the alpha and omega of all extra claims, outside wages and salaries, labelled bonus with separate adjectives demarcating the identity of each species. But this issue has to be sized up not in vacuo but against the backdrop of the progressive change around us. 26. Today it is accepted doctrine that Labour is the backbone of the nation, particularly in the area of economic self-reliance. This means the welfare of the working classes is not only a human probJcm but a case where the success of the nation's economic adventures depends on the cooperation of the working \"classes to make a better India. Indeed, on the national agenda is the question of Labour participa~ion in Manage- ment. Against such a perspective of developmental jurisprudence there is not much difficulty in recognising customary bonus and contractual bonus as permissible in Industrial Law. given proper avcrments and sufficient proof. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In his submission the Bonus Act is a complete code and what is not covered by its provisions cannot be awarded by the tribunal. It is true that if the Bonus Act is a complete code and is exhaus- tive of the subject, whatever the species of bonus, there may be a bar, but it is quite conceivable that the codification may be of everything relating to profit bonus in which case other types of bonus are left untouched. Merely calling a statute a code is not to silence the claimant for bonus under heads which have nothing to do with the subject-matter of the code. On listening to the intricate argument about implicit codification of the law of bonus by this Act, one is reminded of Professor Gilmore who put the case against codification thus12 : The law, codified, ha\" proved to be quite as unstable, unpredictable, and uncertain - quite as mulishy unruly - as the common law, uncodified, had ever been. The rules of law, purified, have remained the exclusive preserve ot the lawyers ; the people are still very much in our coils and clutches as they ever were if not more so. 28. The argument of the Bonus Act being an all-inclusive code is based on the anatomy of the Act and the ruling in Ghewar ChandH. So the judicial task is to ascertain the history and object of the Act, the rele- vant surrounding circumstances leading upto it, its scheme and the prohi- bitions, exclusions, exemptions and savings which reveal the intent and ambit of the enactment. Long ago, Plowden, with Sibyline instinct, pointed out that the be~t way to construe the scope of an Act of Parliament is not to stop with the words of the sections. Every law consists of two parts viz., of body and soul. The letter of the law is the body of the law, and the sense and reason of the law is the soul of the law. The 'social conscience' of the judge hesitates to deprive the working class, for whom Part IV of the Constitution has shown concern, of such rights as they currently enjoy by mere implication from a statute unless there are compulsive provisions constraining the court to the conclusion. From this perspective, let us examine the exclusionary contention based on the body and soul of the Bonus Act. If the Bonus Act is a complete code, on a true decoding of its scheme and spirit, the industrial court cannot take off the ground with any other forms of bonus - yes, that is the implication of 'a complete code'. 29. Bonm, ha~ varying conceptual contents in different branches of law and life. We are here concerned with its range of meanings in indus- trial law but, as expatiated earlier, there is enough legal room for plural patte1 ns of bonus, going by lexicographic or judicial learning.

We have to bring in some legal philosophy into this linguistic problem as it incidentally involves doctrinal issues where the Constitution is not altogether nonaligned. Statutory interpretation, in the creative Indian context, mav look for lie;ht to the lodestar of Part IV of the Constitution e.g., Article· 39 (a) and -( c) and Article 43. Where two judicial choices are available, the construction in conformity with the social philosophy of Part IV has prefcrt>nce. 30. In Ja/an Trading Co. 1 1i Shah, J. (as he then was) gave a synopsis of the development of the branch of industrial law relating to bonus from the days of the First World War to the report of the Bonus Commission culminating in the Bonus Act, 1965. The story of 'war bonus', the Full Bench formula and this Court's view that bonus is not a gratuitous payment made by the employer to his workmen, nor a deferred wage, and that where wages fall short of the living standard and the industry makes profit part of which is due to the contribution of labour, a claim for bonus may be legitimately made by the workmen are set out in that decision. The Full Bench formula was based on profits and the terms of reference to the Commission put profit in the forefront as the foundation of the scheme to define the concept of bonus, to consider in relation to industrial employments the question of payment of bonus based on profits and to recommend principles for computation of such bonus and methods of payment. . . . A glance at the various chapters of the report brings home the point that bonus based on profits is its central theme. The conclusions and recom- mendations revolve round the concept or profit bonus. Little argument is needed to hold that the bonus formula suggested by the Commission was profit-oriented. Indeed, that was its only concern. The Act, .substan- tially modelled on these proposals, has adopted a blueprint essentially worked out on profit. The presiding idea being a simplified version of bonus linked to profits over a period, shedding the complex calculations in the Full Bench formula, the statute did not cover other independent species like customary or contractual bonus which had become an economic reality and received judicial recognition. There were marginal references to and accommodation of other brands of bonus but thev were for better effectuat- ing the spirit and substance of profit-based bon~s. 31. The question then is: Was the Bonus Act only a sjmpler re- incarnation of the Full Bench formula as argued by Shri Tarkunde, or was it, going by the provision<; and precedents, a full codification of multiform bonuses, thus giving a knockdown blow to any customary but illegitimate demand for bonus falling outside the statute. as contended by Shri Pai ? Indeed. we were taken through the well-known categories of bonus vis-a-vis the statutory provisions with impre,;;;sive and knowledgeable thoroughness by Shri Pai with a view to strengthen his perspective that the Act encompassed the whole law and left nothing outside its scope. 32.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf MUMBAI KAMGAR SABHA v. ABDULBHAI FAIZULLABHAI (Krishna Iyer, J.) 847 which was its judicial ancestor, the Commission Report which was its immediate progenitor and the statutory milieu as also the majuscule pattern of bonus prevalent in the Indian industrial world, converge to the· point that the paramount purpose of the Payment of Bonus Act was to regulate profit bonus, with incidental incursions into other allied claims like custo- mary or attendance bonus. If such be the design of the statute, its scheme cannot be stretched to supersede what it never meant to touch or tackle. 33. The objects and reasons of the Bonus Act indicate that the subject-matter of the statute is 'the question of payment of bonus based on profit to employees employed in establhhments'. The report of the Com- mission is also referred to in the objects and reasons and the tenor is the same. The long title of the Act is noncommittal, but the concept of 'profit' as the basis for bonus oozes through the various provisions. For instance, the idea of accounting year, gross profit and the computation thereof, the methodology of arriving at the available surplus and the items deductible from gross profits, have intimate relevance to profit ,bonus - and may even be irrelevant to customary or traditional bonus or contrac- tual bonus. Similarly, the provision for set-on and set-off of allocable sur- plus and the like are pertinent to profit-based bonus. Schematically speaking, statutory bonus is profit bonus. Nevertheless, there is provision for avoidance of unduly heavy burden under different heads of bonus. For this reason it is provided in Section 17 that where an employer has paid any Puja bonus or other customary bonus, he will be entitled to deduct the amount of bonus so paid from the amount of bonus payable by him under the Act. Of course, if the customary bonus is thus recognised statutorily and, if in any instance it happens to be much higher than the bonus payable under the Act, there is no provision totally cutting off the customary bonus. The provision for deduction in Section 17, on the other hand, indicates the independent existence of. customary bonus although, to some extent, its quantum is adjustable towards statutory bonus. Again Section 34 provide~ for giving effect to the Bonus Act thus : Notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law ... or in the terms of any award, agreemeJlt, settlement or contract of service made before May 29, 1965. This does not mean that there cannot be contractual bonus or other species of bonus. This provision only emphasises the importance of the obligation of the employer, in every case, to pay the statutory bonus. The other sub-sections of Section 34 also do not destroy the survival of other types of bonus than provided by the Bonus Act. Shri G. B. Pai used the provi~ sions of the Coal Mines Provident Fund and Bonus Scheme Act, 1948, referred to in Section 3 5 of the Bonus Act, for the purpose of making good his thesis that the Bonus Act has comprehensive coverage except where it expressly saves any other scheme of bonus. Our understanding of Sec- tion 35 is different. Coal mines are extremely hazardous undertakings and they are largely located in agrarian areas where the agricultural workers absent themselves for long periods to attend to agricultural work and do not report themselves for mining work. Coal mines have many peculiarities and the workmen employed there have to be treated separately from the point of view of incentive for attendance.

Of course, there are provisions for exemptions and exclusions in the Bonus Act itself, particularly, vis-a- vis small establishments and public sector undertakings. There is also marginal reference in Section 2(21) to Section 2(21) (iv) to other kinds of bonus, including incentive, production and attendance bonus. The heart of the statute, plainly read from its object and provisions, reveals that the Act has no sweep wider than profit bonus. 34. There was reference to the Payment of Bonus (Amendment) Ordinance, 1975 by Counsel on both sides. We find that the long title has been expanded and now covers bonus on the basis of profit or on the basis of production or productivity. This amendment itself implies that formerly a narrower species of bonus, namely, that based on profit had alone been dealt with. The limits on contractual bonus also tends to feed our conclusions. The implications of the ceiling set by the recent amendment to the law falls outside our scope and we keep away from determining it. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. 35. It is clear further from the long title of the Bonus Act of 1965 that it seeks to provide for bonus to persons employed 'in certain establish, ments' not in all establishments. Moreover, customary bonus does not require calculation of profits, available surplus because it is a payment founded on long usage and justified often by spending on festivals and the Act gives no guidance to fix the quantum of festival bonus ; nor does it expressly wish such a usage. The conclusion seems to be fairly clear, unless we strain judicial sympathy contrarywise, that the Bonus Act dealt with only profit bonus and matters connected therewith and did not govern customary, traditional or contractual bonus. 36. The end-product of our study of the anatomy and other related factors is that the Bonus Act spreads the canvas wide to exhaust profit- based bonus but beyond its frontiers is not void but other cousin claims bearing the caste name 'bonus' flourish - 'miniatures of other colours'. The Act is neither proscriptive nor predicative of other existences. 37. The trump card of Shri G. B. Pai is the ruling in Ghewar Chand. If the ratio there is understood the way Shri Pai would have it, the workmen have no case to present. For, establishments employing less than 20 workers are excluded from the benignant campus of the Act and the appellants fall outside the grace of the statute for that reason alone. Does the decision exhaust the branch of jurisprudence on every kind of bonus or merely lays down that profit-based bonus -- the most common one and complicated in working out on the mathematics of the Full Bench formula - has been picked out for total statutory treatment and for that pattern of bonus the Act operates as a complete code? The tribunal understood the former way and followed it Lip with a rejection, on the ground of a legal bar, of the admitted]y non-profit-based claim for bonus. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf MUMBAI KAMOAR. SABHA v. ABDULBHAI FAIZULUBHAI (Krishna Iyer, J.) 849 Shri Tarkunde argues the reasoning to be a misunderstanding of the meaning of the ruling. We hold that the Bonus Act speaks, and speaks as a whole code, on the sole subject of profit-based bonus but is silent on, and cannot therefore annihilate by implication, other distinct and different kinds of bonus such as the one oriented on custom. ~~ confess that the gravitational pull on judicial construction, of Part 1 v of the Constitution, has, to some extent, influenced our choice. 38. It is trite, going by anglophonic principles, that a ruling of a superior court is binding law. It is not of scriptural sanctity but is of ratiowise luminosity within the edifice of facts where the judicial lamp plays the legal flame. Beyond those walls and de hors the milieu we cannot impart eternal vernal value to the decision, exalting the doctrine of pre• cedents into a prisonhouse of bigotry, regardless of varying circumstances and myriad developments. Realism dictates that a judgment has to be read, subject to the facts directly presented for consideration and not affecting those matters which may lurk in the record. Whatever be the position of subordinate courts, casual observations, generalisations and sub silentio determinations must be judiciously read by courts of coordinate jurisdiction and, so viewed, we are able to discern no impediment in reading Ghewar Chand as confined to profit-bonus, leaving room for non-statutory play of customary bonus. The case dealt with a bonus claim by two sets of workmen, based on profit of the business but the workmen fell outside the ambit of the legislation by express exclusion or exemption. Nothing relating to any other type of bonus arose and cannot be impliedly held to have been decided. The governing principle we have to appreciate as a key to the understanding of Ghewar Chand is that it relates to a case of profit bonus urged under 'the Industrial Disputes Act by two sets of workmen employed by establishments which are either excluded or exempted from the Bonus Act. The major inarticulate premise of the statute is that it deals with - and only with profit-based bonus as has been explained at some length earlier. There is no categorical provision in the Bonus Act nullifying all other kinds of bonus, nor does such a conclusion arise by necessary implication. The ruling undoubtedly lays down the law thus : Considering the history of the legislation, the background and the circumstances in which the Act was enacted, the object of the Act and its scheme, it is not possible to accept the construction suggested on behalf of the respondents that the Act is not an exhaustive Act dealing comprehensively with the subject-matter of bonus in all its aspects or that Parliament still left it open to tho!>e to whom the Act does r.ot apply by reason of its provisions either as to exclusion or exemption to raise a dis- pute with regard to bonus through industrial adjudication under the Industrial Disputes Act or other corresponding law. But this statement, contextually construed, means that profit-bonus not founded on the provisions of the Bonus Act and by resort to an adventure in industrial dispute under the Industrial Disputes Act is no longer per- mis-.iblc. \\Vhen Parliament has expressly excluded or exempted certain categorie,;; from the Bonus Act. they are bowled out so far as profit-based bonu\" is concerned.

Ltd.~cccc® 10NLINEr True Prinf 850 SUPREME COURT CASES (1976) 3 sec pertinence of the following observations of Shelat, J. becomes self-evident, unden:tood in this setting : We are not impressed by the argument that Parliament in excluding such petty establishments could not have intended that employees therein who were getting bonus under the Full Bench formula should lose that benefit. As aforesaid, Parliament was evolving for the first time a statutory formula in regard to bonus and laying down a legislative policy in regard thereto as to the classes of persons who would he entitled to bonus thereunder. It laid down the definition of an 'employee' far more wider than the definition of a 'workman' in the Industrial Dis• putes Act and the other corresponding Acts. If, while doing so, it expressly excluded as matter of policy certain petty establishments in view of th~ recommendation of the Commission in that regard, viz., that the application of the Act would lead to harassment of petty proprietors and disharmony between them and their employees, it cannot be said that Parliament did not intend or was not aware of the result of exclusion of employees of such petty establishments. Likewise, reference to agreements and settlements providing for bonus being exempted from the applicability of the Act does not militate against the survival of contractual bonus ( we are not referring to the impact of the latest amendment by ordinance of 197 5). Viewed thus and in the light of the observations earlier extracted, the following passage fits into the perspective we have outlined : Section 32(vii) exempts from the applicability of the Act (the Bonus Act) those employees who have entered before May 29, 1965 into an agreement or settlement with their employers for payment of bonus linked with production or productivity in lieu of bonus based on profits and who may enter· after that date into such agreement or settlement for the period for which such agreement or settlement is in operation. Can it be said that in cases where there is such an agreement or settlement in operation, though this clause expressly excludes such employees from claiming bonus under the Act during such · period, the employees in such case<; can still resort to the Industrial Disputes Act and claim bonus on the basis of the Full Bench formula ? The answer is obviously in the negatiYe for the object in enacting clause (vii) is to let the parties work out such an agreement or settlement. It cannot be that despite this position, Parliament intended that those employees had still the option of throwing aside such an agreement or settlement, raise a dispute under the Industrial Disputes Act and claim bonus under the Full Bench formula. The contention, therefore. that the exemption under Section 32 excludes those employees from claiming bonus un~er the Act only and not from claiming bonus under the Industrial Disputes Act or such other Act is not correct. 39. The core question about the po1icy of the Par1iament that was agitated in that case turned on the availabi1ity of the Industrial Disputes Act as an independent method of claiming profit bonus de hors the Bonus Act and the Court took the view that it would be subversive of the scheme of the Act to allow an inva<;ion from the flank in that manner. The following observations strengthen this approach : Surely. Parliament could not have .intended to exempt these establishments from the burden of bonus payable under the Act and yet have left the door open for their employees to rajse indu'ltrial dispute<; and get bont1'i under the Full Bench formula which it h:ic:; rejected hy laying down a different statutory formula in the Act. For instance. i<; it to be contemplated that though the Act by Section 32 exe!11pt., institution<; such as th~ universities or t~e Indian R_ed Cross Society or hospitals. or any of the establishments set out m clause (1x) of that section, they would still be liable to pay bon11s if the employees of those institutions were to raise a di<;pute under the Industrial Dispute<; Act and claim bonus in accordance with the Full Bench formula ?

ABDULBHAI FAIZULLABHAI (Krishna Iyer, J.) 851 that case, be giving exemption by one hand and taking it· away by the other. thus frustrating the very object of Section 32. Where, on the other hand, Parliament intended to retain a previous provision of law under which bonus was payable, or was being paid it has expressly saved such provision. Thus, under Section 35 the Coal Mines Provident Fund and Bonus Schemes Act, 1946 and any scheme made thereunder are saved. If, therefore, Parliament wanted to retain the right to claim bonus by way of industrial adjudication for those who are either excluded or exempted from the Act, it would have made an express saving provision to that effect as it has done for employees in coal mines. A discerning and concrete analysis of the scheme of the Act and the reasoning of the court leaves us in no doubt that it leaves untouched customary bonus. 40. The plea of constructive res judicata is based on the 'might and ought' doctrine. Shri Pai's argument is that before the Arbitration Board no case of customary or contract bonus was urged for the year 1965 and so, in later years, such a ground is barred by the general principles of res judicata. Sections 1 OA, 18 and 19 (3) of the Industrial Disputes Act were pressed before us to demonstrate the prior award was binding on the workers and rea4ing it in the light of Pandurang 16 the bar was spelt out. It is clear law, so Jong as the above ruling stands, that industrial litigation is no exception to the general principle under- lying the doctrine of res judicata. We do entertain doubt about the extension of the sophisticated doctrine of constructive res judicata to industrial law which is governed by special methodology of conciliation, adjudication and considerations of p'.?aceful industrial relations, where co11ective bargaining and pragmatic iustice daim precedence over formalised rules of decision based on individual contests, specific causes of action and findings on particular issues, but we are convinced that Pandurang does not apply at all to our case. There. overtime wages were claimed earlier under the Factoriec:; Act and the case was reiected by the tribunal. After this rebuff, a like claim wa'i repeated but sustaining it on the Bombay Shops and Ec:;tabli'ihmentc:; Act. This new ground to support the same claim was held to be barred because the workmen could and ought to have raised the issue that the Factories Act failing. the Shops Act was available to them to back up their demand. The fallacy in invoking this deci<;ion lie<; in the fact that ac:; early as 1950 there was a binding award of the indu<;trinl tribunal relating to the cla1m. which had not been put an end to. and so this Court took the view that so long as that award stood, the same c1aim under a different guise (the Shop'i Act) could be subver<;ive of the rule of re<; iudicata. The decisive circumstance which dio;ting11io;hcc; that ca<;c i<; contained in the ob'iervation : If the workerc; ar~ dic;c:atic;fied with any of the items in respect of which their claim hac; been rejected it ic; oren to them to raise a fresh industrial dispute. That i<; to c:;ay. if a frec:;h di<;putc had been raised. after terminating the prior award. no bar of rcs iudicata could have been urged.

The dangers of constructive res judicata in the area of suits vis-a-vis writ petitions under Article 226 and as between proceedings under Article 226 and Article 32 are such as toswarrant a closer study. To an extent the Law Commission of India in its report16 has touched on this topic. Industrial disputes are an a fortiori case. 41. Dispute-processing is not by court litigation alone. Industrial peace best flourishes where non-litigative mechanisms come into cheerful play before tensions develop or dispute brew. Speaking generally, alternatives of the longish litigative process is a joyous challenge to the Indian activist jurist and no field is in need of the role of avoidance as a means of ending or pre-empting disputes as industrial life. Litigation, whoever wins or loses, is often the funeral of both. We are a developing country and need techniques of maximising mediatory methodology as potent processes even where litigation has erupted. This socially compulsive impulse prompted the setting in motion of a statesmanlike effort by the senior Counsel on both sides, with helpful promptings from the Bench, to advise their clients into a conciliatory mood. Should we have at all hinted to the advocates to resolve by negotiation or stick to our traditional function of litigative adjudication? In certain spheres, 'judicious irreverence to judicialised argumentation is a better homage to justice'. Regrettably, the exercise proved futile and we have to follow up our conclusions with necessary directions. 42. The findings we have reached may now be formally set down. We hold that the Bonus Act (as it stood in 1965) ·does not bar claims to customary bonus or those based on conditions of service. Secondly we repel 'the plea of res judicata. There is no merit in the view that the industrial tribunal has no .iurisdiction to try the dispute referred to it. We set aside the award and direct the tribunal to decide on the merits the subject-matter of the dispute referred to it by the State Government. The appeal is hereby allowed but, having regard to the overall circumstances, the parties will bear their costs. (1976) 3 Supreme Court Caaea 852 (Before H. R. Khanna, R. S.
