We find no a express prohibition as at present under the terms of the lease. Unless the Government amends the rules or imposes appropriate restrictive covenants prohibiting the bequest in favour of the strangers or by enacting appropriate law, there would be no statutory power to impose such restrictions prohibiting such bequest in favour of the strangers. It is seen that the object of assignment of the government land in favour of the lessee is to provide b him right to residence. If any such transfer is made contrary to the policy, obviously, it would be defeating the public purpose. But it would be open to the Government to regulate by appropriate covenants in the lease deed or appropriate statutory orders as per law or to make a law in this behalf. But so long as that is not done and in the light of the permissive language used in clause ( 12) of the lease deed, it cannot be said that the bequest in favour of c strangers inducting a stranger into the demised premises or the building erected thereon is not governed by the provisions of the regulation or that prior permission should be required in that behalf. However, the stranger legatee should be bound by all the covenants or any new covenants or statutory base so as to bind all the existing lessees. 13. Under these circumstances, the action taken by the respondent d cannot be said to be vitiated by an error of law. The High Court, therefore, has not committed any manifest error of law warranting interference. As stated earlier, this order does not preclude the Government from taking such step as is warranted under law to prohibit transfer in violation of the covenants or defeating the public policy. e f g h 14.

The essential ingredients for establishing an offence of criminal breach of trust as defined in Section 405 and punishable under Section 406 !PC with sentence for a period up to three years or with fine or with both, are: ( i) entrusting any person with property or with any dominion over property; (ii) the person entrusted dishonestly m1sappropnattng or converting to his own uc;e that property; or e dishonestly using or disposing of that property or wilfully suffering any other person so to do in v10lation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust 1s to be discharged, or of any legal contract made touching the discharge of such trust.

Entrustment 1s not necessarily a term of law. It may have different 1mpltcat10ns in different contexts. In us most general significance, all its imports is handing over the possession for some purpose which may not imply the conferment of any proprietary right therein.

It is not open for the Court to sift or appreciate the evidence at that stage with reference to the material and come to the conclusion that no prima facie case is made out for proceeding further in the matter. It is equally settled law that it is open to the Court, before issuing the process, to record the evidence and on consideration of the averments made in the complaint and the evidence thus adduced, it is required to find out whether an offence has been made out. On finding that such an offence has been made out and after taking cognizance thereof, process would be issued to the respondent to take further steps in the matters. If it is a charge-sheet filed under Section 173 of the Code, the facts stated by the prosecution tn the charge-sheet, on the basis of the evidence collected during investigation, would disclose the offence for which cognizance would be taken by the court to proceed further in the matter. Thus it is not the province of the court at that stage to embark upon and sift the evidence to come to the conclusion whether offence has been made out or not. (Para 14) State of B1har V.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf RASH MI KUMAR v MAHESH KUMAR BHADA ( K. Ramaswamy, J.) 40 I The parties have three children from the wedlock. It is not in dispute that there was estrangement in the marital relationship between the husband and a the wife. It is the case of the appellant that she was treated with cruelty and was driven out of the marital home along with the three children. She was constrained to lay proceeding~ under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights. The appellant was given jewellery, i.e., gold and silver ornaments and other household goods enumerated in Annexures I and II and also cash by her parents, brothers and other relatives b at different ceremonies prior to her marriage and after the marriage at the time of bidai (farewell). She claims that all these articles constituted her stridhana properties and were kept in the custody of the respondent-husband. The respondent had asked the appellant to entrust for safe custody all the jewellery and cash mentioned in Annexure I, to his father with the promise that on her demand whenever made, they would be returned. Accordingly, c she had entrusted them to the appellant at Lucknow in the presence of three named witnesses. Similarly, the household goods mentioned in Annexure II were entrusted by the parents of the appellant to the respondent at the time of farewell in the presence of three named witnesses. They lived together in Delhi in her in-laws' house. The appellant alleged in the complaint that she was treated with cruelty in the matrimonial home and ultimately on d 24-7-1978/25-7- 1978 she and the children were thrown out from the matrimonial home under duress and at the peril of their lives. Accordingly, she was driven out from the matrimonial home without getting an opportunity to take with her stridhana properties enumerated in Annexures I and II. 3. She filed an application under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act e for restitution of conjugal rights. Even thereafter she went to Cochin whereat the respondent-husband was working, on 9-10-1986 and requested him to restitute her into the conjugal society along with the children. He promised that he would do it provided she withdrew her application for restitution of conjugal rights. He also promised to return the jewellery and other valuables mentioned in Annexures I and II entrusted to him . Even after her f withdrawing the application, on 21-10-1986, he did not take her into the conjugal society. Therefore, she was again constrained to file second application on 18- 1 1-1986 for restitution of conjugal rights. She also filed application under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short \"the Code\") for maintenance. Since these attempts proved unsuccessful, she made a demand on 5-12-1987 to return the jewellery as g detailed in Annexure I and household goods mentioned in Annexure II but the respondent flatly refused to return her stridhana properties. Consequently, she filed a private complaint on 10-9-1990. 4. After recording her statement under Section 200 of the Code, the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and issued process to the respondent. While the respondent appeared in the Court, he filed an h application under Section 482 of the Code in the High Court to quash the proceedings.

Ltd. ~(!;<D® IONLINEf True Prinf 402 SUPREME COURT CASES (1997) 2 sec quashed the proceedings on two grounds, viz ., (i) the appellant did not make out any case in the complaint and (ii) it is barred by limitation. On the ground of limitation, the learned Judge came to the conclusion that in a October 1986 the appellant had made a demand for return of the jewellery and gold but the respondent did not return the same. Therefore, it furnished a cause of action. Since complaint was laid in September 1990, it was clearly barred by limitation the period prescribed being three year~ . 5. Smt Indira Jaising, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, contended that the ratio in Pratibha Rani v. Suraj Kumar 1 has stood the test b of time for more than a decade though therein there was difference of opinion between the majority and the minority on certain aspects of the matter. The decision has never been doubted by any other Bench. The said ratio is based on the personal law as elaborately discussed in the judgment. Therefore, it requires reiteration . Shri Rajinder Singh, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, sought to support the present c reference to the three-Judge Bench on the basis of the conduct of the appellant. He also contends that a clear demand for return of the stridhana properties was made in October 1986 when the respondent had refused to return the same. Since the complaint came to be filed only in September 1990, i.e., after a delay of 1 I months from the expiry of prescribed limitation, it i-; time barred. Since no application for condonatton of delay d was filed, the High Court was enjoined to dismiss the complaint as being barred by limitation. Smt Indira Jaising contended that the offence punishable under Section 406 Indian Penal Code (for short \"the IPC\") 1s a continuing offence and hence cause of action arose every day subsequent to the refusal and, therefore, the complaint was not barred by limitation. Shri Rajinder Singh further contended that the respondent has always been e willing to transfer his flat in Bombay in the name of his daughters. He also states that he has been paying every month maintenance allowance in respect of the children. Even if the value of the articles which the appellant is claiming is mentioned, the respondent is prepared to deposit the same in a fixed account in the name of his daughters. This conduct on the part of the respondent would militate against the conduct of the appellant who intends f to harass the respondent by filing endless complaints. These circumstances would go to indicate that there are no justifiable reasons for interference with the order of the High Court. At this juncture, it is relevant to note that several attempts made by this Court to have the dispute settled amicably between the parties, could not bear any fruit of succes~. Therefore, we are not inclined to undertake the exercise once over. g 6. The question that has arisen for consideration is whether the ratio in Pratibha Rani case I does not hold good any more. That case also related to a complaint filed under Section 406 IPC for breach of trust by the respondent- husband on his refusing to return stridhana property, viz., Jewellery, wearing apparel etc. The question that had ansen for consideration was whether the stndhana property wa~ exclusive property of the appellant-wife or wa~ a h Jomt property owned and held by both the spouses? Though all the three ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd. ~(!;<D® IONLINEf True Prinf RASHMI KUMAR v MAHESH KUMAR BHADA ( K. Ramaswamy, ].) 403 learned Judges concurred on the point of entrustment of the jewellery and wearmg apparel to be stridhana, the majority view was that the stridhana a property was the exclusive property of the appellant-wife and that, therefore, the failure to return the property in the custody of the husband to the wife constitutes breach of trust defmed under Section 405 IPC. Therefore, the offence of breach of trust punishable under Section 406 was made out, as per the averment~ contained in the complaint. The minority view was that the property entrusted to the husband after the marriage is joint property of the b wife and the husband. The essential requirement for constituting an offence defined under Section 405 IPC in relation to stridhana property, is that there should be a specific separate agreement between the parties, whereby the property of the wife or the husband, as the case may be, is entrusted. In the absence of such a separate agreement for specific entrustment, it would not be possible to draw an inference of entrustment of custody or dominion over c the property of one spouse to the other and/or his or her close relations so as to attract the stringent provisions of Section 406 IPC; otherwise there would be disastrous effects and consequences on the peace and harmony which ought to prevail in matrimonial homes. The appropriate remedy would appear to be by way of a civil suit for recovery of the stridhana property. 7. Fazal Ali, J., speaking for him,;;elf and Sabyasachi Mukharji, J., as he d then was, held that the possession of saudayika or stridhana of a Hmdu married female dunng coverture is absolutely dear and unambiguous. She is the absolute owner of her stridhana property and can deal with it in any manner she f ikes. She may spend the whole of it or give 1t away at her own pleasure by gift or will without any reference to her husband. Ordinarily, the husband has no right or interest in it with the sole exception that in times of e extreme distress, as in famine, illness or the like, the husband can utilise it but he is morally bound to restore it or its value when he is able to do so. This right is purely personal to the husband and the property so received by him in marriage cannot be proceeded against even in execution of a decree for debt passed against the husband. If in spite of demands for return of the articles, the husband refuses to return them to the wife, tt amounts to an f offence of criminal breach of trust. The stridhana property is not a joint property of the wife and the husband. Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act merely provides another remedy of suit to recover from the husband or the persons to whom the stridhana property was entrusted. The mere factum of the husband and the wife livmg together does not entitle either of them to commit a breach of criminal law and if one does, then he or she will be g liable for all the consequences of such breach. By merely living in matrimonial home the stridhana does not become joint property of the spouses. It is also not a partnership property between the wife and the husband. The concept of partnership is alien to the stridhana property under the personal law. Therefore, entrustment of stridhana, without creating any right in the husband except, puttmg the articles in his possession, does not h entitle him to use the same to the detriment of his wife without her consent. The husband has no justification for not returning the said articles as and ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The husband being only a custodian of the a stridhana of his wife, cannot be said to be in joint possession thereof and does not acquire a joint interest in the property. It was, therefore, concluded that the custody or entrustment of the stridhana with the husband does not amount to partnership in any sense of the term nor does the stridhana become a joint property. It was held in para 60 of the judgment that taking all the allegations made in the complaint, by no stretch of imagination it b could be said that they do not prima facie amount to an offence of criminal breach of trust against the respondent. Thus there could be no room for doubt that all the facts stated in the complaint constitute an offence under Section 406 IPC and the appellant could not be denied the right to prove her case at the trial by pre-empting it at the very inception by the order pa~~ed by the High Court. Accordingly, it was quashed. Direct10n was given to c proceed with the trial from the stage at which stay was granted by this Court. The only difference of point was whether there should be &pecial agreement of entrustment.

He further states: \"That which is obtained by a married woman or by a maiden, in the house of her husband or of her father, from her brother (from her husband) or from her parents, 1s ~tridhana\" [Vide: Katyayana cited in Mit., II, xi, 5; Smritichandrika, IX, ii, 4-5; V. May., IV, x, 8 etc.]. Under the caption \"Yautaka and ayautaka\", it is stated that: \"Yautaka is that which is given at the nuptial fire . ... It includes all gifts made during f the marriage ceremonies. Ayautaka is gift made before or after marriage. Saudayika includes both Yautaka and Ayautaka and received from strangers. It is defined to be gifts from affectionate kindred.\" In support thereof, he relied on Venkaraddi Mardeppa Lingdal v. Hanmantgouda Ramangouda Kulkarni2 and K. Muthukaruppa Pillai v.

Katyayana declares: \"The independence of women who have received the a saudayika weaith is desirable (in regard to it), for it was given (by their kindred) for their maintenance out of affection. The power of women over saudayika at all times is absolute both in respect of gift and sale, according to their pleasure, even in (the case of) immovables.\" The Smritichandrika would confine saudayika to yautaka or the like, received by a woman from her own parents or persons connected with them, in the house of either her b father or her husband, from the time of her betrothment to the completion of the ceremony to be performed on the occasion of her entering her lord's house. But this view has not been followed. The texts of Katyayana and Vyasa have been explained by other commentators as including gifts received by her from her husband, and from others after her marriage. The decisions of the courts have taken the same view. Provided the gift is made c by her husband or her parents or by relatives either of her husband or of parents, it is immaterial whether it is made before marriage, at marriage or after marriage. It is equally her saudayika. In other words, saudayika means all gifts and bequests from relations but not gifts and bequests from strangers. Saudayika of all sorts are absolutely at a woman's own disposal. She may spend, sell, devise or give it away at her own pleasure. In support d of that conclusion, footnote No. 6 cites several decisions including Venkata Rama Rao v. Venkata Suriya Rao5 and Muthukaruppa v. Sellathammal3 etc. It is stated thereafter that her husband can neither control her in her dealings with it, nor use it himself. But he may take it in case of extreme distress, as in a famine, or for some indispensable duty, or during illness, or while a creditor keeps him in prison. Even then he would appear to be under at least e a moral obligation to restore the value of the property when able to do so. What he has taken without necessity, he is bound to repay with interest. This right to take the wife's property is purely a personal one in the husband. If he does not choose to avail himself of it, his creditors cannot proceed against her properties. The word \"take\" in the text of Yajnavalkya means \"taking\" and \"using\" Hence if the husband taking his wife's property in the f exceptional circumstances mentioned in the text does not actually use it, the wife still remains its owner and the husband's creditors have no claim against the property. 9. A woman's power of disposal, independent of her husband's control, is not confined to saudayika but extends to other properties as well. Devala says: \"A woman's maintenance (vritti), ornaments, perquisites (sulka), gains g (labha), are her stridhana. She herself has the exclusive right to enjoy it. Her husband has no right to use it except in distress .... \" In N.R. Raghavachariar's Hindu Law - Principles and Precedents, (8th Edn.) edited by Prof. S.

Para 4 71 deals with \"Wedding gifts\" and it is stated therein that properties gifted a at the time of marriage to the bride, whether by relations or strangers, either Adhiyagni or Adhyavahanika, are the bride's stridhana. In para 481 at page 426, it is stated that ornaments presented to the bride by her husband or father constitute her Stridhana property. In para 487 dealing with \"powers during coverture\" it is stated that saudayika meaning the gift of affectionate kindred, includes both Yautaka or gifts received at the time of marriage as b well as its negative Ayautaka. In respect of such property, whether given by gift or will she is the absolute owner and can deal with it in any way she likes. She may spend, sell or give it away at her own pleasure. 10. It is thus clear that the properties gifted to her before the marriage, at the time of marriage or at the time of giving farewell or thereafter are her stridhana properties. It is her absolute property with all rights to dispose at c her own pleasure. He has no control over her stridhana property. Husband may u~e it during the time of his distress but nonethele~~ he has a moral obligation to restore the same or its value to his wife. Therefore, stridhana property does not become a joint property of the wife and the husband and the husband has no title or independent dominion over the property as owner thereof. d 11. In this backdrop, the que~tion that ari~es for consideration is: Whether the fact of a wife's having been dnven out from the matrimonial home without taking along with her stridhana properties, amounts to entrustment with the husband within the meaning of Section 405 IPC? Section 405 defines \"criminal breach of trust\" thus: \"405. Criminal breach of trust.-Whoever, being in any manner e entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishone~tly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property m violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, expres~ or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits 'crimmal breach of trust'.\" f 12. It is not necessary to refer to the Explanations to the said section for the purpose of this case. Hence they are omitted. 13. Thus when the wife entrusts her stridhana property with the dominion over that property to her husband or any other member of the g family and the husband or .:;uch other member of the family dishonestly misappropriates or converb to his own use that property or wilfully suffers any other person to do so, he commits criminal breach of trust. The essential ingredients for establishing an offence of criminal breach of trust as defined in Section 405 and punishable under Section 406 IPC with sentence for a period up to three years or with fine or with both, are: (i) entrusting any person with property or with any dominion over property; (il) the per~on h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The expression \"entrustment\" carries with it the implication that the person handing over any property or on whose behalf that property is handed over to another, continues to be its owner. Entrustment is not necessarily a term of law. It b may have different implications in different contexts. In its most general significance, all its imports is handing over the possession for some purpose which may not imply the conferment of any proprietary right therein. The ownership or beneficial interest in the property in respect of which criminal breach of trust is alleged to have been committed. must be in some person other than the accused and the latter must hold it on account of some person c or in some way for his benefit. In Pratibha Rani case 1 the majority has extensively considered the words \"entrustment\" of and \"dominion\" over the property. All the case-law in that behalf was exhaustively considered obviating the necessity to tread once over the same. In order to establish entrustment of dominion over the property, both the majority and minority relied on m particular the judgment of this Court m Velji RaghavJi Patel v. d State of Maharashtra 6 wherein it was held that in order to establish entrustment of dominion over the property to an accused person, mere existence of that person's dominion over the property is not enough. It must be further shown that his dominion was the result of entrustment. The que~tion therein pertamed to the entrustment with the dominion over the partnership property by one partner to the other. It was held that the e prosecution must establish that the dominion over the assets or particular assets of the partnership was by a special agreement between the parties. The property of the partnership being a partnership asset, every partner has a right to or a dominion over it. It was held that special agreement was necessary to constitute an offence of cnminal breach of trust defined under Section 405 IPC. In view of the finding that stridhana property is the t exclusive property of the wife on proof that she entrusted the property or dominion over the stridhana property to her husband or any other member of the family, there is no need to establish any further special agreement to establish that the property was given to the husband or other member of the family. It is always a question of fact in each case as to how the property came to be entrusted to the husband or any other member of the family by g the wife when she left the matrimonial home or was dnven out therefrom. No absolute or fixed rule of universal application can be laid down in that behalf. It requires to be established by the complainant or the prosecution, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the ca~e, as to how and in what manner the entrustment of the stridhana property or dominion over her stridhana came to be made to the husband or any other member of the family h or the accused person, as the case may be. We are in respectful agreement 6 ( I 965) 2 SCR 429 · AlR 1965 SC 1433 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The next question is whether the appellant has made out any prima a facie case of entrustment in that behalf. A reading of the complaint clearly indicates that her parents entrusted the property to the respondent at the time of her farewell from her parents' house in Lucknow. They lived together in their matrimonial home in Delhi. Three children were born from the wedlock and during that period she had retained the custody of the property. When she left the matrimonial home she had not taken the property with her. b She has specifically averred that when she went in October 1986 to Cochin requesting the respondent-husband to take her into the matrimonial home along with the children, he promised to take her in the conjugal society and also that he would return the jewellery to her subject to the condition that she should withdraw her application filed under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights and accordingly she had c withdrawn the application. The learned Single Judge failed to correctly appreciate her evidence recorded under Section 200 of the Code that she made a demand for return of the jewellery and household goods. On the other hand, a fair reading of it would indicate that when she met the respondent in Cochin and requested to take her and the children to home he promised to do so on her withdrawing the case for restitution of conjugal d rights. Thereat the husband promised to return them but he did not keep up his promise. The sequences that followed were that she filed another case for restitution of conjugal rights and an application for maintenance and thereafter she filed the complaint under Section 406 IPC. A fair reading of the averments would clearly indicate that a prima facie ca,e of entrustment of the jewellery and the household goods had been made out. The learned e Judge was not right in jumping to the conclusion that the averments made by the respondent in the counter-affidavit disclosed that no entrustment was made of the jewellery, cash and household goods and other moveables enumerated in Annexures I and II details of which are not material for our purpose. In the light of the above, we are of the view that a prima facie case of entrustment had been made out by the appellant as the stridhana f properties were not returned to her by the husband. Obviously, therefore, the learned Magistrate, having taken cognizance of the offence, had issued process for appearance of the respondent. It i~ fairly settled legal position that at the time of taking cognizance of the offence, the Court has to consider only the averments made in the complaint or in the charge-sheet filed under Section 173, as the case may be. It was held in State of Bihar v. Rajendra g Agrawalla7 that it is not open for the Court to sift or appreciate the evidence at that stage with reference to the material and come to the conclusion that no prima facie case is made out for proceeding further in the matter.

On finding that such an offence has been a made out and after taking cognizance thereof, process would be issued to the respondent to take further steps in the matters. If it is a charge-sheet filed under Section 173 of the Code, the facts stated by the prosecution in the charge-sheet, on the basis of the evidence collected during investigation, would disclose the offence for which cognizance would be taken by the court to proceed further in the matter. Thus it is not the province of the court b at that stage to embark upon and sift the evidence to come to the conclusion whether offence has been made out or not. The learned Judge, therefore, was clearly in error in attempting to sift the evidence with reference to the averments made by the respondent in the counter-affidavit to find out whether or not offence punishable under Section 406 IPC had been made out. c 15. The next question that needs to be answered is whether the complaint filed by the appellant in September 1990 is time barred. Section 468 of the Code prescribes period of limitation. Under sub-section (3) thereof, the period of limitation shall be three years if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding one year but not exceeding three years. Since the offence alleged to have been committed by d the respondent is punishable under Section 406, viz., criminal breach of trust, and the punishment of imprisonment which may extend to three years or with fine or with both, the complaint is required to be filed within three years from date of the commission of the offence. It is seen that the appellant has averred in paras 21 and 22 of the complaint that she demanded from the respondent return of jewellery detailed in Annexure I and household goods e mentioned in Annexure II on 5-12-1987 and the respondent flatly refused to return the stridhana of the complainant-wife. In para 22 of the complaint, it is stated that the complainant was forced to leave the matrimonial home in the manner described and the stridhana mentioned in Annexures I and II belonging to the complainant was entrusted to the respondent-accused which he refused to return to the complainant. Thus she has averred that the f respondent \"has illegally, dishonestly and mala fidely retained and converted it to his own use which is clearly a criminal breach of trust in respect of the aforesaid property\". The complaint was admittedly filed on 10-9-1990 meaning within three years from the date of the demand and refusal by the respondent. The learned Judge relied upon her evidence recorded under Section 200 of the Code. The learned counsel for the respondent read out the g text of the evidence to establish that the appellant had demanded in October 1986 for return of the jewellery and that the respondent refused to do the same. Thus it constitutes refusal from which date the limitation period began to run and the complaint having been filed in September 1990, is time barred, i.e., beyond three years. That view of the learned Judge is clearly based on the evidence torn of the context without reference to the specific h averments made in the complaint and the evidence recorded under Section 200 of the Code.

It is incongruous to comprehend the demand for return of jewellery etc. at the stage when she was persuading him to take her a into the matrimonial home . Accordingly, we hold that the complaint was filed within the limitation. 16. The question, therefore, whether it is a continuing offence and limitation began to run everyday loses its relevance, in view of the above finding. The decisions cited in support thereof, viz., Vanka Radhamanohari v. Vanka Venkata Reddy8 and Bairam Singh v. Sukhwant Kaur9 hence need b not be considered. It is well-settled legal position that the High Court should sparingly and cautiously exercise the power under Section 482 of the Code to prevent miscarriage of justice. In State of H.P v. Pirthi Chand 10 two of us (K. Ramaswamy and S.B. Majrnudar, JJ.) composing the Bench and in State of U.P v. O.P Sharma 11 a three-Judge Bench of this Court, reviewed the entire case-law on the exercise of power by the High Court under Section c 482 of the Code to quash the complaint or the charge-sheet or the first information report and held that the High Court would be loath and circumspect to exercise Its extraordinary power under Section 482 of the Code or under Article 226 of the Constitution. The Court would consider whether the exercise of the power would advance the cause of justice or it would tantamount to abuse of the process of the court. Social stability and d order require to be regulated by proceeding against the offender as it i~ an offence against the society as a whole. This cardinal principle should always be kept in rnmd before embarking upon the exercise of the inherent power vested in the court. Sarne view was taken in State of Haryana v. Bhajan La/ 12 and G.L. Didwania v. ITO 11 etc. 17. Considered from this perspective, we hold that the High Court was e wholly wrong in quashing the complaint/proceedings under Section 482 of the Code. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The judgrnent of the High Court is set aside. We make it clear that all the observations in the judgrnent on merits are only to find out prirna facie case whether the High Court would be justified in the exercise of its power under Section 482.
