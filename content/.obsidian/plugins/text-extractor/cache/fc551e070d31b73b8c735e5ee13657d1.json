Thereafter certain enquiries were made by the Chief Secretary, Manipur State which we have already dealt with. In the course of hearing, a request was made by Mr V aidyanathan, learned counsel for the petitioner and at a later date by Miss Haksar that the Manipur State Government be called upon to produce : (i) Report of the Superintendent of Police, (ii) Report of the Deputy Commissioner and (iii) Statement of Y angya Anei Tangkhul alias Maluganai Tangkhul. A copy of the third document is already produced. As far as reports men- tioned at (i) and (ii), privilege was claimed on behalf of E. Kunjeshwar Singh, Secretary (Home), Manipur. In the affidavit claiming privilege, it is stated that the aforementioned two reports dated April 28, 1982 and May 31, 1982 were with regard to the incident that occurred on March 10, 1982. Before adjudicating upon the claim of privilege, we called upon Mr V.C. Mahajan, learned counsel for the State of Manipur to produce the reports for our perusal. We read the reports. We are not inclined to examine the question of privilege for the obvious reason that these reports are hardly helpful in any manner in the disposal of this petition, and further the three relevant documents, namely, the telex message sent by the Deputy Commissioner to Superintendent of Police, the report made by the Superintendent of Police to the Deputy Commissioner and the short report submitted by the Deputy Commissioner to the Chief Secretary, Manipur State have been disclosed in the proceed- ings. Therefore, we do not propose merely to add to the length of the judgment by examining the question of the privilege claimed in respect of the two reports ' first dated April 28, 19 8 2 by the Super- intendent of Police and another dated May 31, 1982 by the Deputy Commissioner. 33.

The Delhi High Court was constituted in 1966. Prior to 1966 Punjab High Court had 3urisd1ct1on over the area of Delhi. Since Punjab High Court had no ordinary ongmal civil jurisdiction the ordinary original civil jurisdiction was exercised by the subordinate courts. All civil matters in Delhi therefore were filed m the trial court. By virtue of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966 a change was brought about and the Delhi High Court came to exercise the original c1v1l 111nsdiction above certain valuation. Section 10 of the Act provided that where a single Judge of the High Court of Delhi exercises ordinary or1g1nal civil jurisdiction conferred by sub-section (2) of Section 5, an appeal shall lie from the j udgment of the single Judge to a division bench of that High Court. In University of Delhi v. Hafiz Mohd. Said1 the question arose as to what interpretation is to be given to the expression 'judgment' in Section 10(1) of the Act. One view was that the word 'judgment' should be given a meaning which has been given by various High Courts when mterpretmg the Letters Patent. The full bench held that keeping the historical perspective and the long years for which appeals on the ofiginal ~1dc were only mamta1nable either against a decree or against orders enumerated under Order 43, Rule 1 the Legislature could not have intended that those orders which were not appealable when passed by the subordinate Judge pnor to November 1, 1966 should suddenly become appealable when the ordin ary original jurisdiction of certain valuation was passed on to the High Court In the present context this would entail that whereas at present under the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of less than one lakh vested with the Di~tnct Judge no appeal would lie if an amendment was refused, nevertheless an appeal would lie 1f the learned single Judge of the High Court refused the amendment. The full bench also had taken note of various conflicting views amonest the various High Courts and had noted that for over 100 years the courts had not been able to sort out the problems of the exact meaning to be given to the word 'judgment'. That is why the full bench accepted that ,he .ippeab would lie only against those orders passed by the single Judge which dre mentioned in Section 104 read with Order 43, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the instant case the learned single Judge refused .unendment. Against that order an appeal was brought to the division bench 1.

This matter was taken up in special leave petition to the Supreme Court which relied upon Shah Babulal Khimji v . .Jayaben D. Kania2 to overrule the Delhi High Court full bench decision. The reasoning given is that though every interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment yet those orders would be Judgment which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable rights of the pa,rties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. It was held that as lhe amendment of written statement was sought at the time of framing the issues and vitally affected rights of the parties and sought to work some injustice to the plaintiff, it merited serious consideration by the appellate court on the question of whether or not amendment should be allowed. All that was held by the Supreme Court in Babulal Khimji case2 was that Letters Patent does not exclude or override the application of Section 104 read with Order 43, Rule 1, CPC. This only means that in interpreting the word judgment in Letters Patent broadly the 'orders' mentioned in Order 43 Rule 1 would be construed as judgment and appealable. But the reverse does not automatically follow. That an order which are appealable under Section 10 of the Delhi High Court Act should not be limited by Order 43 but be given the general meaning given to the word 'judgment' under Letters Patent 1s not part of the ratio of Babulal Khimji case2. The thrust of the decision was merely that Order 43 was not excluded by Letters Patent. What has now m effect been held by the Supreme Court is that not only an order under Order 43 but all orders and judgments become appealable under the Delhi High Court Act. Curiously both in the instant case and even in Babulal case 2 on which reliance has been placed there is no reference to the full bench decision of the Delhi High Court. The Delhi High Court was not unaware that appeals under Letters Patent judgment have been interpreted very liberally and not confined within the contours of Order 43, Rule 1. Nevertheless it took the view that in 1966 the Legislature clearly did not mtend to mtroduce substantive change except the change of forum for civil matte1 s of a certam valuation by enacting that they be tried by the High Court rather than by the subordinate courts.] ORDER 1. Counsel for both the parties are present and we have heard them at length. The High Court was clearly wrong in refusing to go into the merits of the case on the ground that appeal was not maintainable in view of the full bench decision in University of Delhi v. Hafiz Mohd. Said 1 • This decision is no longer good law in view of our decision in the case of Shah Babula! Khimji v. Jayaben D. Kania 2 where we have laid down various parameters and con- ditions under which an appeal can lie from a single Judge to the division bench. Paragraph 115 at page 1816 of the above-referred decision may be extracted thus : (SCC p. 57, para 115) Thus, in other words every interlocutory order cannot be regarded as a judgment but only those orders would be judgments 1.

UNION OF INDIA 361 which decide matters of moment or affect vital and valuable rights of the parties and which work serious injustice to the party concerned. Similarly, orders passed by the trial Judge deciding question of admissibility or relevancy of a document also cannot be treated as judgments because the grievance on this score can be corrected by the appellate court in appeal against the final judgment. 2. In the instant case as the amendment of the written statement was sought at the time of framing issues and it vitally affects the right of the parties and seeks to work some injustice to the plaintiff, it merits serious consideration by the appellate court on the question whether or not amendment should be allowed. It would certainly not be a purely interlocutory order against which no appeal before the LP A bench would be maintainable. More than this we would not like to say at this stage as we intend to send the case back to the division bench for admitting the appeal and disposing it of according to law on merits. The order of the division bench dated April 1, 1982 is set aside and the division bench is directed to admit the appeal and decide it on merits in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made above. We would request the High Court to decide the appeal as early as possible as the suit is ~till pending. The appeal is accordingly allowed. (1984) 1 Supreme Court Cases 361 (BEFORE D .A. DESAI, R.B.
