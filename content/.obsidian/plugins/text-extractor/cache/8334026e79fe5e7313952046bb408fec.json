The money suit bearing CS No. 11 of 2014 was decreed. These legal developments were submitted by the appellant creditor to the interim resolution professional when claims were invited by him. The claim of the appellant debtor on the ground that there was no privity of contract between parties. This action of the interim resolution professional was challenged before the National Company Law Tribunal. However, this challenge was negated. This order was challenged before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (\"NCLAT\"). However, there was delay of 44 days in filing of appeal. This appeal was dismissing on the ground of limitation as the Appellate Tribunal refused to condone delay on ground of lack of jurisdiction. Hence, this appeal before the Supreme Court. Dismissing the appeal, the Supreme Court Held: (i) On limitation Law of limitation may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes. The court has no power to extend the period oflimitation on equitable grounds. It is further observed that the statutory provision may cause hardship or inconvenience to a particular party but the Court has no choice but to enforce it by giving full effect to the same. (Para 15.3) Popat Bahiru Govardhane v. LAO, (2013) lO SCC 765: (2014) 1 SCC (Civ) 149,followed It is true that in a given case there may arise a situation where the applicant/ appellant may not be in a position to file the appeal even within a statutory period of limitation prescribed under the Act and even within the extended maximum period of appeal which could be condoned owing to genuineness viz. illness, accident, etc. However, under the statute, Parliament has not carved out any exception of such a situation. Therefore, in a given case, it may cause hardship, however, unless Parliament has carved out any exception by a provision of law, the period of limitation has to be given effect to. Such powers are only with Parliament and the legislature. The courts have no jurisdiction and/or authority to carve out any exception. If the courts carve out an exception, it would amount to legislate which would in turn might be inserting the provision to the statute, which is not permissible. (Para 14) (ii) On interpretation of statutes and irrelevance of hardship There may be a statutory provision, which causes great hardship or inconvenience to either the party concerned, or to an individual, but the Court has no choice but to enforce it in full rigour. It is a well-settled principle of interpretation that hardship or inconvenience caused, cannot be used as a basis to alter the meaning of the language employed by the legislature, if such meaning is clear upon a bare perusal of the statute. If the language is plain and hence allows only one meaning, the same has to be given effect to, even if it causes hardship or possible injustice. (Para 15) If there is any hardship, it is for the legislature to amend the law, and that the Court cannot be called upon to discard the cardinal rule of interpretation for the purpose of mitigating such hardship. If the language of an Act is sufficiently clear, a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(RESOLUTION PROFESSIONAL) the Court has to give effect to it, however inequitable or unjust the result may be. The words, \"dura lex sed lex\" which mean \"the law is hard but it is the law\" may be used to sum up the situation. Therefore, even if a statutory provision causes hardship to some people, it is not for the Court to amend the law. A legal enactment must be interpreted in its plain and literal sense, as that is the first principle of interpretation. (Para 15) \"Inconvenience is not\" a decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute. A result flowing from a statutory provision is never an evil. A Court has no power to ignore that provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from its operation. A statute must of course be given effect to whether a Court likes the result or not. (Para 15) Therefore, it is evident that the hardship caused to an individual, cannot be a ground for not giving effective and grammatical meaning to every word of the provision, if the language used therein, is unequivocal. (Para 15) In a case where the statutory provision is plain and unambiguous, the court shall not interpret the same in a different manner, only because of harsh consequences arising therefrom.

Sita Ram Agarwal, (2003) 2 SCC 577; Punjab National Bank v. Bareja Kripping Fasteners, 2005 SCC OnLine P&H 552, cited (iii) On inapplicability of equity Law prevails over equity if there is a conflict. Equity can only supplement the law and not supplant it. (Para 15.1) BSNL v. Mishri Lal, (2011) 14 SCC 739: (2014) l SCC (L&S) 387, relied on What is administered in courts is justice according to law, and considerations of fair play and equity however important they may be, must yield to clear and express provisions of the law. Equity and law are twin brothers and law should be applied and interpreted equitably but equity cannot override written or settled law. It is now well settled that when there is a conflict between law and equity the former shall prevail. Equitable considerations have no place where the statute contained express provisions. The period of limitation statutorily prescribed has to be strictly adhered to and cannot be relaxed or departed from for equitable considerations. (Para 15.2) Raghunath Rai Bareja v.

Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, (2010) 5 SCC 23, cited Sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right. It is further trite that despite an extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in Article 142 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court ordinarily would not pass an order which would be in contravention of a statutory provision. (Para 19) Teri Oat Estates (P) Ltd. v. State (UTofChandigarh), (2004) 2 SCC 130; Latham v. R. Johnson & Nephew Ltd., (1913) 1 KB 398: (1911-12) All ER Rep 117 (CA), relied on a b C Thus, considering the statutory provisions which provide that delay beyond 15 d days in preferring the appeal is uncondonable, the same cannot be condoned even in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. (Para 20) (v) On/acts The appeal preferred before NCLAT was under Section 61 (2) IBC. As per Section 61 (2) IBC, the appeal was required to be preferred within a period of thirty days. Therefore, the limitation period prescribed to prefer an appeal was 30 days. However, as per the proviso to Section 61 (2) IBC, the Appellate Tribunal may allow an appeal to be filed after the expiry of the said period of 30 days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing the appeal, but such period shall not exceed 15 days. Therefore, the Appellate Tribunal has no jurisdiction at all to condone the delay exceeding 15 days from the period of 30 days, as contemplated under Section 61(2) IBC. (Para 8) In the present case, even the appellant creditor applied for the certified copy of the order passed by the adjudicating authority on 8-4-2019 i.e. after a delay of 34 days. Therefore, even the certified copy of the order passed by the adjudicating authority was applied beyond the prescribed period of limitation i.e. beyond 30 days. The certified copy of the order was received by the appellant creditor on 11-4-2019 and the appeal before NCLAT was preferred on 24-6-2019 i.e. after a delay of 44 days. As the Appellate Tribunal can condone the delay up to a period of 15 days only, the Appellate Tribunal refused to condone the delay which was beyond 15 days from completion of 30 days i.e. in the present case delay of 44 days and consequently dismissed the appeal. Therefore, as such, it cannot be said that the Appellate Tribunal committed any error in not condoning the delay of 44 days, which was beyond the delay of 15 days which cannot be condoned as per Section 61(2) IBC.

Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order1 passed by the learned NCLAT in dismissing the appeal on the ground of limitation and refusing to condone the delay which was beyond the period of 15 days, which the Appellate Tribunal could have condoned, the appellant National Spot Exchange Limited has preferred the present appeal. 5. Shri Maninder Singh, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant and Shri Abhishek, learned advocate has appeared on behalf of the IRP. 5.1. Shri Maninder Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has submitted that though the learned Appellate Tribunal may be justified in dismissing the appeal on the ground of limitation by holding that the Appellate Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond 15 days, it is prayed to exercise the powers under Article 142 of the Constitution oflndia, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. 5.2. It is submitted that on investigation by the Directorate of Enforcement, it is revealed that PD Agro which was the sister concern of the corporate debtor, has siphoned off Rs 744 crores to the corporate debtor. It is submitted that there was a common management/Directors of PD Agro as well as the corporate debtor. It is submitted that both the corporate debtor and PD Agro are sister concerns and have the same management. Dunar Foods Ltd. is a flagship entity of PD Agro and is the main beneficiary of the funds received by PD Agro from the trades executed on the appellant' s platform. It is submitted that one Mr Ranjeev Agarwal and Ms Sheetal Gupta are the Directors and shareholders of PD Agro. Shri Ranjeev Agarwal was also the CFO of the corporate debtor and Ms Sheetal Gupta is the wife of Shri Surender Gupta. It is submitted that Shri Surender Gupta is the Promoter and Managing Director of the corporate debtor. It is submitted that even Shri Surender Gupta in his statement given under Section 50 PMLA before the Enforcement Directorate has confirmed that he was managing the affairs of PD Agro and that PD Agro is a shareholder of Dunar Foods Ltd., holding 8.25% shares. It is submitted that therefore management and Directors of PD Agro and the corporate debtor Dunar Foods Ltd. played a fraud. 5.3. It is submitted that even PD Agro admittedly owes and did not pay INR 693 crores towards their liability despite admitting its liability vide letter dated 1-8-2013 and had assured to clear its outstanding in 20 weeks in the said letter.

It is submitted that therefore when it is revealed during investigation that PD Agro siphoned off Rs 744 crores to the corporate debtor, the IRP ought to have admitted the claim of the appellant even by lifting the veil. It is submitted that NCLT has also not considered the aforesaid in its true perspective and has not even lifted the corporate veil which ought to have been done in the facts and circumstances of the case. 5.4. It is further submitted by Shri Maninder Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that therefore in the aforesaid peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, where a huge amount of Rs 693 crores is involved, which is due and payable to the appellant herein, which can be said to be a public body which provided an electronic exchange platform which commenced its operations after the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Government of India granted it an exemption under Section 27 of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 to launch one-day forward contracts for buying and selling of commodities and therefore it is prayed to condone the delay in preferring the appeal before NCLAT, in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Heavy reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court in Chitra Sharma v. Union of India 3 ; Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. v. IDBI Bank Ltd. 4 ; and Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mampee Timbers & Hardwares ( P) Ltd. 5, in support of his prayer to condone the delay beyond the time prescribed under IBC i.e. the delay of 44 days in preferring the appeal before NCLAT, in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. 6. The present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Abhishek, learned advocate appearing for the IRP for corporate debtor. It is submitted that Section 61(2) of the Code provides for power of the Appellate Tribunal to condone the delay in the appeal. It is submitted that the Appellate Tribunal can condone the delay of only 15 days over the period of 30 days, if there is a sufficient cause. It is submitted that beyond the period of 15 days, over the period of 30 days, the Appellate Tribunal has no jurisdiction to condone the delay. It is submitted that therefore the learned Appellate Tribunal has rightly and correctly dismissed the appeal on the ground that it did not have the power to condone the delay beyond the period of 15 days, over the period of 30 days i.e. in the present case the delay of 44 days. 6.1. It is submitted that as held by this Court in Union of India v. Popular Construction Co. 6, where the legislature prescribed a special limitation for the purpose of the appeal and the period of limitation of 60days was to be computed after taking the aid of Sections 4, 5 and 12 of the Limitation Act, the specific inclusion of these sections meant that to that extent only the provisions of the 3 (2018) 18 sec 575 4 (2020) 3 sec 328 : (2020) 2 sec (Civ) 113 5 (2021) 3 sec 673 : (2021) 2 sec (Civ) 323 6 c2001) 8 sec 470 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the a IRP that once the statute provides the period of limitation and to condone the delay up to a particular period and the statute specifically provides that beyond a particular period, the delay cannot be condoned, the same has to be adhered to. Heavy reliance is placed on the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage (P) Ltd. 7 6.3. It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the IRP that b the law made by Parliament must be given effect to. It is submitted that as held by this Court in a catena of decisions that hardship is no ground not to give effect to the mandate of Parliament and that law overrides equitable considerations. Reliance is placed on the following decisions of this Court, Rohitash Kumar v. Om Prakash Sharma 8, SCC paras 23 to 26; BSNL v. Mishri Lal9 , SCC para 20; Raghunath Rai Bareja v. Punjab National Bank 10, SCC paras 29 to 37; Popat c Bahiru Govardhane v. LAO 11 , SCC para 16; and Martin Burn Ltd. v. Corpn. of Calcutta 12, SCC para 14. 6.4. Making the above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions and the relevant provisions of the statute, namely, sub-section (2) of Section 61 of the Code, it is submitted that as such no error has been committed by the learned Appellate Tribunal in not condoning the delay beyond the period d of 15 days, over the period of 30 days. It is submitted that as such the learned Appellate Tribunal has acted just in consonance with the provisions of the statute and has followed the statutory provisions strictly. 6.5. Now so far as the prayer on behalf of the appellant to condone the delay beyond the period prescribed under the statute, in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India is concerned, it is submitted that as e observed and held by this Court in ONGC Ltd. v. Gujarat Energy Transmission Corpn. Ltd. 13 where the statute commands that the court shall not condone the delay beyond a particular day, in other words, can condone delay only up to a particular day and not beyond that, it would come within the ambit and sweep of the provisions and policy of legislation and therefore it is uncondonable and it cannot be condoned even taking recourse to Article 142 of the Constitution of f India. It is submitted that what cannot be done directly under the statute as per the statutory provisions cannot be permitted to be done indirectly, in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. 6.6.

Shah, J.) filed by the appellant and the supporting documents are perused, it is evident that the claim filed to the extent of Rs 673.85 crores is a claim against PD Agro. It is submitted that the appellant has filed its claim against the corporate debtor on the ground that fraud/scam has been done by PD Agro in connivance with various entities including the corporate debtor and therefore an amount of Rs 673.85 crores alleged to be payable by PD Agro should be paid by the corporate debtor. It is submitted that even the decree passed in Commercial Suit No. 11 of 2014 has been passed2 only against PD Agro and not the corporate debtor. It is submitted, therefore, even otherwise the appellant is not a creditor of the corporate debtor and therefore, IRP has rightly not entertained the claim of the appellant. It is further submitted that even thereafter the resolution plan has been approved by NCLT, the adjudicating authority and the appellant has already assailed the approved resolution plan in Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No. 424 of 2020 before NCLAT. 6.7. Making the above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal. 7. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length. 8. At the outset, it is required to be noted that the appellant herein has challenged the order passed by the adjudicating authority dated 6-3-2019 affirming the decision of the resolution professional of rejection of the claim of the appellant before NCLAT. The appeal preferred before NCLAT was under Section 61(2) of the IB Code. As per Section 61(2) of the IB Code, the appeal was required to be preferred within a period of thirty days. Therefore, the limitation period prescribed to prefer an appeal was 30 days. However, as per the proviso to Section 61(2) of the Code, the Appellate Tribunal may allow an appeal to be filed after the expiry of the said period of 30 days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing the appeal, but such period shall not exceed 15 days. Therefore, the Appellate Tribunal has no jurisdiction at all to condone the delay exceeding 15 days from the period of 30 days, as contemplated under Section 61(2) of the IB Code. 9. Section 61(2) of the IB Code reads as under: \"61. (2) Every appeal under sub-section (1) shall be filed within thirty days before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal: Provided that the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal may allow an appeal to be filed after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing the appeal , but such period shall not exceed fifteen days .\" 10. In the present case, even the appellant applied for the certified copy of the order passed by the adjudicating authority on 8-4-2019 i.e. after a delay of 34 days. Therefore, even the certified copy of the order passed by the adjudicating authority was applied beyond the prescribed period of 2 Na tional Spot Exchange Ltd. v. P.D.

The certified copy of the order was received by the appellant on 11-4-2019 and the appeal before NCLAT was preferred on 24-6-2019 i.e. after a delay of 44 days. As the Appellate Tribunal can condone the delay up to a period of 15 days only, the Appellate Tribunal refused to condone the delay which was beyond 15 days from completion of 30 days i.e. in the present case delay of 44 days and consequently dismissed the appeal. Therefore, as such, it cannot be said that the learned Appellate Tribunal committed any error in not condoning the delay of 44 days, which was beyond the delay of 15 days which cannot be condoned as per Section 61 (2) of the IB Code. 11. An identical question came to be considered by this Court in Popular Construction Co. 6 While considering Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which provided that an application for setting aside of the award cannot be made after three months and it further provided that if the court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making an application within the said period of three months, it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter, after considering Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act and after observing that \"the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is a special law\" and that Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides for a period of limitation different from that prescribed under the Limitation Act, ultimately this Court held that Section 5 of the Limitation Act shall not be applicable as the legislature has prescribed a special limitation for the purpose of the appeal as provided under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 12. In paras 11 and 12, it is observed and held as under: (Popular Construction case6 , SCC pp. 474-75) \"11. Thus, where the legislature prescribed a special limitation for the purpose of the appeal and the period of limitation of 60 days was to be computed after taking the aid of Sections 4, 5 and 12 of the Limitation Act, the specific inclusion of these sections meant that to that extent only the provisions of the Limitation Act stood extended and the applicability of the other provisions, by necessary implication stood excluded. 12. As far as the language of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial words are \"but not thereafter\" used in the proviso to sub-section (3). In our opinion, this phrase would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and would therefore bar the application of Section 5 of that Act. Parliament did not need to go further. To hold that the court could entertain an application to set aside the award beyond the extended period under the proviso, would render the phrase \"but not thereafter\" wholly otiose. No principle of interpretation would justify such a result.\" 6 Union of India v.

An identical question came to be considered by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage ( P) Ltd. 7 The question before the Constitution Bench was, whether the District Forum has the power to extend the time for filing of response to the complaint beyond the period of 15 days, in addition to 30 days, as envisaged under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act? After approving the decision of this Court in J.J. Merchant v. Shrinath Chaturvedi 14 and after considering the various decisions of this Court on the point, the Constitution Bench has ultimately concluded that \"the District Forum has no jurisdiction and/or power to extend the time for filing of response to the complaint beyond the period of 15 days, in addition to 30 days, as envisaged under Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act. 14. It is true that in a given case there may arise a situation where the applicant/appellant may not be in a position to file the appeal even within a statutory period of limitation prescribed under the Act and even within the extended maximum period of appeal which could be condoned owing to genuineness viz. illness, accident, etc. However, under the statute, Parliament has not carved out any exception of such a situation. Therefore, in a given case, it may cause hardship, however, unless Parliament has carved out any exception by a provision of law, the period of limitation has to be given effect to. Such powers are only with Parliament and the legislature. The courts have no jurisdiction and/or authority to carve out any exception. If the courts carve out an exception, it would amount to legislate which would in tum might be inserting the provision to the statute, which is not permissible. 15. In Rohitash Kumar8, this Court observed and held as under: (SCC pp. 459-60, paras 23-26) \"23. There may be a statutory provision, which causes great hardship or inconvenience to either the party concerned, or to an individual, but the Court has no choice but to enforce it in full rigour. It is a well-settled principle of interpretation that hardship or inconvenience caused, cannot be used as a basis to alter the meaning of the language employed by the legislature, if such meaning is clear upon a bare perusal of the statute. If the language is plain and hence allows only one meaning, the same has to be given effect to, even if it causes hardship or possible injustice. (Vide: CIT v. Keshab Chandra Mandal 15 ; and D.D. Joshi v. Union of India 16). 24. In Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v.

If the language of an Act is sufficiently clear, the Court has to give effect to it, however inequitable or unjust the result rnay be. The words, \"dura lex sed lex\" which mean \"the law is hard but it is the law\" may be used to surn up the situation. Therefore, even if a statutory provision causes hardship to some people, it is not for the Court to amend the law. A legal enactment must be interpreted in its plain and literal sense, as that is the first principle of interpretation. 25. In Mysore SEB v. Bangalore Woollen, Cotton & Silk Mills Ltd. 18 , a Constitution Bench of this Court held that, \"inconvenience is not\" a decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute. In Martin Burn Ltd. v. Corpn. of Calcutta 12, this Court, while dealing with the same issue observed as under: (Martin Burn Ltd. case 12 , AIR p. 535, para 14) '14. A result flowing from a statutory provision is never an evil. A Court has no power to ignore that provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from its operation. A statute must of course be given effect to whether a Court likes the result or not.' (See also: CIT v. Vegetable Products Ltd. 19 ; and Tata Power Co. Ltd. v. Reliance Energy Ltd. 20). 26. Therefore, it is evident that the hardship caused to an individual, cannot be a ground for not giving effective and grammatical meaning to every word of the provision, if the language used therein, is unequivocal.\" 15.1. In Mishri Lal9 , it is observed that the law prevails over equity if there is a conflict. It is observed further that equity can only supplement the law and not supplant it. 15.2.

Similarly, in Nasiruddin v. Sita Ram Agarwal25 (vide para 35) this Court observed: (SCC p. 588) '35. In a case where the statutory provision is plain and unambiguous, the court shall not interpret the same in a different manner, only because of harsh consequences arising therefrom.' 35.

Thereafter, again the Bank waited for 5 years and it was only on 1-4-1999 (sic 11-1-1999) that it filed its third execution petition. We fail to understand why the Bank waited from 1990 to 1994 and again from 1994 to 1999 in filing its execution petitions. Hence, it is the Bank which is responsible for not getting the decree executed well in b time.\" (emphasis in original) In the case before this Court, the claim made by the Bank was found to be time- barred and to that this Court observed that while the equity is in favour of the Bank, the law is not in favour of the borrower, however, since the claim is time- barred, as the execution petition was barred by the limitation, this Court set c aside as such the execution petition. 15.3. In Popat Bahiru Govardhane 11 , this Court has observed and held that it is a settled legal position that the law of limitation may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes. The Court has no power to extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds. It is further observed that the statutory provision may cause d hardship or inconvenience to a particular party but the Court has no choice but to enforce it by giving full effect to the same. 16. It is also required to be noted that even Shri Maninder Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has, as such, fairly conceded that considering Section 61 (2) of the IB Code, the Appellate Tribunal has jurisdiction or power to condone the delay not exceeding 15 days from the completion of 30 days, the statutory period of limitation. However, he has requested and prayed to condone the delay in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, in the facts and circumstances of the case and submitted that the amount involved is a very huge amount and that the appellant is a public body. We are afraid what cannot be done directly considering the statutory provisions cannot be permitted to be done indirectly, while exercising the powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. 17. At this stage, decision of this Court in ONGC Ltd. 13 is required to be referred to. Before this Court, the question was with respect to delay beyond 120 days in preferring the appeal under Section 125 of the Electricity Act and the question arose whether the delay beyond 120 days in preferring the appeal is condonable or not. After considering various earlier decisions of this Court on the point and considering the language used in Section 125(2) of the Electricity Act which provided that delay beyond 120 days is not condonable, this Court 11 Popat Bahiru Govardhane v.

Shah, J.) has observed and held that it is not condonable and it cannot be condoned, even taking recourse to Article 142 of the Constitution. 18. While observing and holding so in para 15, this Court in ONGC Ltd. 13 has observed and held as under: (SCC p. 51) \"15. From the aforesaid decisions, it is clear as crystal that the Constitution Bench in Supreme Court Bar Assn. v. Union of Jndia 29 has ruled that there is no conflict of opinion in A.R. Antulay case30 or in Union Carbide Corpn. case 31 with the principle set down in Prem Chand Garg v. Excise Commr. 32 Be it noted, when there is a statutory command by the legislation as regards limitation and there is the postulate that delay can be condoned for a further period not exceeding sixty days, needless to say, it is based on certain underlined, fundamental, general issues of public policy as has been held in Union Carbide Corpn. case 31 . As the pronouncement in Chhattisgarh SEB v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission33 lays down quite clearly that the policy behind the Act emphasising on the constitution of a special adjudicatory forum, is meant to expeditiously decide the grievances of a person who may be aggrieved by an order of the adjudicatory officer or by an appropriate Commission. The Act is a special legislation within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act and, therefore, the prescription with regard to the limitation has to be the binding effect and the same has to be followed regard being had to its mandatory nature. To put it in a different way, the prescription of limitation in a case of present nature, when the statute commands that this Court may condone the further delay not beyond 60 days, it would come within the ambit and sweep of the provisions and policy of legislation. It is equivalent to Section 3 of the Limitation Act. Therefore, it is uncondonable and it cannot be condoned taking recourse to Article 142 of the Constitution.\" 19. In Teri Oat Estates (P) Ltd. v. State (UT of Chandigarh)34, in paras 36 and 37, it is observed as under: (SCC p. 144) \"36. We have no doubt in our mind that sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right. It is further trite that despite an extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in Article 142 of the Constitution of India, this Court ordinarily would not pass an order which would be in contravention of a statutory provision. 13 ONGC Ltd. v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 778 SUPREME COURT CASES (2022) 11 sec 37. As early as in 1911, Farwell, LJ. in Latham v. R . Johnson & Nephew Ltd. 35 observed: (KB p. 408: All ER p. 123E) 'We must be very careful not to allow our sympathy with the infant a plaintiff to affect our judgment: sentiment is a dangerous will o' the wisp to take as a guide in the search for legal principles.' \" 20. Thus, considering the statutory provisions which provide that delay beyond 15 days in preferring the appeal is uncondonable, the same cannot be condoned even in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. b 21. In view of the aforestated settled proposition of law and even considering the fact that even the certified copy of the order passed by the adjudicating authority was applied beyond the period of 30 days and as observed hereinabove there was a delay of 44 days in preferring the appeal which was beyond the period of 15 days which maximum could have been condoned and in view of specific statutory provision contained in Section 61 (2) c of the IB Code, it cannot be said that NCLAT has committed any error in dismissing the appeal on the ground of limitation by observing that it has no jurisdiction and/or power to condone the delay exceeding 15 days . 22. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, no interference of this Court is called for. The present appeal fails and deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the d case, there shall be no order as to costs. e f g h 35 (1913) 1 KB 398: (1911-12) All ER Rep 117 (CA)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
