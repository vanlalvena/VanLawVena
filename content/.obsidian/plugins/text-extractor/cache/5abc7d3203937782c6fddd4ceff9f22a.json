(Special Leave Petition (C) Nos.9036-9038 of 2016) OCTOBER 23, 2019 [ARUN MISHRA, INDIRA BANERJEE, VINEET SARAN, M.R. SHAH AND S. RAVINDRA BHAT, JJ.] Justice Delivery System: Practice and Procedure – Recusal of judge – Whether a Judge who has expressed an opinion in a smaller Bench and the case has been referred to a larger Bench, because of the conflict of the opinion or otherwise, can hear theger bench – Held: Rendering a decision on any issue of law and the corrective procedure of it cannot be said to be ground for recusal of a Judge; otherwise, no Judge can hear a review, curative petition, or a reference made to the larger bench – A Judge who had rendered any decision in a smaller combination is not disqualified from being part of a larger Bench when a reference is made to the larger bench – Rather, it is a consistent practice prevailing in various High Courts as well as of Supreme Court to include the same Judge/Judges in larger Benches. (Arun Mishra, J.) Justice Delivery System: Practice and Procedure – Recusal of judge prayed for on the ground of legal pre-disposition – Held: There is absolutely nothing wrong in holding a particular view in a previous judgment for or against a view canvassed by a litigant – No litigant can choose, who should be on the Bench – He cannotest subsequently or is part of a larger Bench should not hear his case – Furthermore, if a party or his Counsel can at length argue on the question of recusal of the Judge before him, he can also successfully question the correctness of a judgment rendered by him – If litigants are given the right to seek recusal of a judge on the ground that in a smaller Bench, a view has been taken by the Judge, the correctness of which has to be decided by the larger Bench, which includes the same Judge, then on a parity of reasoning recusal might be sought on the ground [2019] 15 S.C.R. 1085 1085 A B D E F G H 1086 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. of the judge having taken a view one way or the other even in aent case in which similar issues were involved if the judge has decided similar issues earlier, in the same Court or in a different Court – This would open the flood gates of forum shopping –ehension of legal pre-disposition would, in reality amount to acceding to the request that a Judge having a particular view and leanings in favour of the view whichode the confidence of the common man for which the judicial system survives – If request for recusal on the ground of legal pre-disposition in the form of a judgment is acceded to, that would destroy the very edifice of an independent judicial system – The entire judicial system is based on sound constitutional principles – The roster making power is bestowed on the Chief Justice of India so that litigants are not able to choose the Judges before whom they have to argue a matter, and he is a constitutional functionary who has been enjoined with this task at the highestcise the power of roster making – Once he has exercised his power, it is not for the Judges to choose – As per their oath, they have to discharge their duties without fear and favour and in a dispassionate manner without any ill will, bias towards litigants, or a cause – Abuse of court – Bench Hunting. Abuse of court: Bench hunting – Request for recusal of Judge by litigants – Held: If requests for recusal are acceded to for the asking, litigants will be unscrupulously taking over the roster making powers of the Chief Justice and that would tantamount toence with the judicial system, by the mighty to have a particular Bench by employing several means and putting all kindsessures from all angles all around – Moreover, recusal in such unjustified circumstances, would become the norm – If recusal is made, it would tantamount to giving room to unscrupulous litigant to have a Judge of their choice who can share the views which are to be canvassed by them – No such right can be given to any person ‘Judicial Recusal’ by Grant Hammond, a former Judge of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand – referred to. A B D E F G H 1087 Justice Delivery System: Recusal of Judge – Who to decide – Held: Recusal is not to be forced by any litigant to choose a Bench – It is for the Judge whose participation is objected to, to decideecusal application – Further, the embarrassment of hearing the lengthy arguments for recusal should not be a compelling reason to recuse – Nothing should come in the way of dispensation of justice or discharge of duty as a Judge and judicial decision-making.

The Orders of the Court were passed by Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (for short, ‘the Act of 2013’), has been referred to a five-Judge Constitution Bench of this Court. 2. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Pune Municipal Corporation & Anr. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki & Ors. (2014) 3 SCC 183, had delivered a judgment interpreting section 24 of the Act of 2013. In Yogesh Neema & Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2016) 6 SCC 387, a two-Judge Bench, doubted the decision of Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. v. State of Tamil Nadu (2015) 3 SCC 353 and referred the matter to a larger Bench. 3. Yet in another Civil Appeal No.20982 of 2017 arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.2131 of 2016 (Indore Development Authority vs. Shailendra (Dead) through Lrs. & Ors., 2018 SCC Online SC 100) the matter was referred to a larger Bench on 7.12.2017.

(supra), the bench consisting of one of us, namely, Arun Mishra, J., Adarsh Kumar Goel, J. and Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J. has decided the matter, and the view taken is that in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra), the Court did not consider several aspects as to the interpretation of section 24 of the Act of 2013. The decision mentioned above was accepted unanimously by the three Judges. However, as Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) was a judgment by a bench of coordinate strength, two of us, namely, myself and Adarsh Kumar Goel, J. opined that decision is per incuriam. However, Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J. opined that it would be appropriate to refer the matter to a larger Bench. In the majority opinion in Indore Development Authority (supra), the questions formulated have been answered thus: “228. Our answers to the questions are as follows:The word ‘paid’ in section 24 of the Act of 2013 has the same meaning as ‘tender of payment’ in section 31(1) of theAct of 2013 or in ‘tender of payment’ used in section 31(1) of the Act of 1894. The words ‘paid’/tender’ and ‘deposited’ are different expressions and carry different meaningsAct of 2013 in the expression ‘paid,’ it is not necessary that the amount should be deposited in Court asAct of 1894.

A three-Judge Bench of this Court on 21.2.2018 requested the other benches to defer the hearing until a decision, one way or the other, on the issue whether the matter should be referred to the larger Bench 6. A Division Bench presided by Adarsh Kumar Goel, J. on 22.2.2018 in Indore Development Authority v. Shyam Verma and Ors., (S.L.P. (C) No.9798 of 2016) considered it appropriate to refer the matter to Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India to refer the issues to be resolved by 7. On 22.2.2018, a Bench consisting of myself and Amitava Roy, J. have in State of Haryana v. Maharana Pratap Charitable Trust (Regd.) & Anr. (Civil Appeal No. 4835 of 2015) referred the matter to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India to constitute an appropriate benchi.e., one consisting of myself and another consisting of Adarsh Kumar Goel, J. referred the matter to Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India.. 8. The case was listed before a five-Judge Constitution Bench on 6.3.2018. The Constitution Bench observed that it would consider allPune Municipal Corporation (supra) and the other judgments following the said decision as well as the judgments rendered in Indore Development Authority (supra). Thus, all the questions are kept open to be decided. No particularger bench. After that, Hon’ble, the Chief Justice of India has constituted this Bench to decide the reference. 9. Mr. Shyam Divan, Mr. Dinesh Dwivedi and Mr. Gopal Sankarnarayanan, learned Senior Advocates on behalf of the respondents, have raised a preliminary objection for recusal of one of us, namely; INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS. [ARUN MISHRA, J.] A B D E F G H 1096 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. the Judges who were on a smaller panel and the correctness of the, as a final view has been expressed in Indore Development Authority (supra) wherein the decision in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) has been held to be per incuriam. Thus, the Judge who has decided the matter in Indore Development Authority (supra) is pre-disposed to decide the matter only in a particular way. It was also submitted that there is reasonable apprehension that the Judge may have some bias in dealingger Bench. As such, one of us, namely; Arun Mishra, J. should recuse. It was further submitted that a Judge couldIndore Development Authority (supra) is wrongly decided. The Court or Tribunal should be above unfairness or bias. The Judge has to step down, in case he cannot impart justice impartially. The judge or judges concerned should excuse themselves and abstain from sitting in the case. 10. Per contra, Shri Tushar Mehta, Learned Solicitor General, Shri Mohan Parasaran, Shri Anoop Chaudhary and Shri Vivek Tankha, learned Senior Advocates submitted that there is no question of recusal and as a matter of substance it is the practice of this Court that the. The plea of bias or pre-disposition is not attracted in the matter of judicial decisions. The plea of bias or pre-disposition is based on, and there are occasions when Hon’ble, the Chief Justice of India, has considered it appropriate to constitute an appropriate A B D E F G H 1097 11. Learned Solicitor General submitted that a tendency is growing in that as soon as important matters are listed, particular articles are 12. Shri Mohan Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel has also pointed out that the practice of this Court makes the law, and the Judges who have decided the matters in a smaller Bench have ordinarily formed. There is nothing wrong in case the Judges who have heard the matter in smaller Benches form part of the larger bench. 13. The first question before us is whether a Judge who has expressed an opinion in a smaller Bench and the case has been referred 14. Shri M.C. Setalvad, in his autobiography “My Life, Law and other things” has referred in Chapter 12 the events between 1955 toActing Chief Justice. It was the Bengal Immunity case. In 1953, a bench presided over by Chief Justice Sastri of which Justice Bhagwati was a member held thattate, even though the sale was an inter-State sale as held in State of Bombay v. United Motors India Ltd., 1953 SCR 1069 with Justice Bose and Justice S.R. Das, Justice Bose delivered a dissenting judgment 15 The same question arose in Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar, 1955 (2) S.C.R. 603, which came up when S.R. Das, J. was INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS.

Following are the “One of the important decisions of the Supreme CourtBengal Immunity Case. That case had an interesting history. Article 286 of the Constitution (as it then stood) prohibited a State LegislatureThe Article was not, however, happily worded. In 1953, a Bench of the Supreme Court presided Justice Bhagwati was a member, held that a State could impose sales tax on goods delivered for consumption in that State, even though the sale was an inter- 1. This decision was contrary to the express provision of the Constitution that Parliament alone could authorise the impositionArticle 286(1)(a), which was not applicable. Justice Bose had delivered a dissenting judgment, and S.R. Das as a puisne judge had also expressed a contrary opinion in another decision. The same question arose in Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar2 which came up when S.R. Das was acting as the Chief Justice. The Bengal Immunity Co. manufactured medicinal products in Bengal and sold them all over India including Bihar. The Company had no office or agent in Bihar but the Bihar salesUnited Motors 1State of Bombay v. United Motors (India) Ltd., (1953) S.C.R. 1069. 2 (1955) 2 S.C.R. 603. A B D E F G H 1099 Case but Das, who held strong views in the matter, had the matter placed before a larger Bench of seven judges including two, Justice Bose and Justice Bhagwati, who had participated in the earlier decision. The matter was of vital importance to the States, because under the view expressed by Chief Justice Sastri in the United Motors Case, one State – the State in which goods had been delivered for consumption as a direct result of the sale – would be, no State at all would be able to tax the goods, as the transaction of sale would be an inter-State sale.

INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS. [ARUN MISHRA, J.] A B D E F G H 1100 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. Supreme Court including Das preferred to follow the American practice.

On the merits, the majority of the Court consisting of four judges, including the acting Chief Justice, came to the conclusionArticle 286 made it clear that it had to deal with different topics and one part could not be. The conclusion reached was that the Explanation to clause (1) (a) could not be ultimately extendedArticle, no State could impose any tax on sales or purchases taking place in. The dissenting view was expressed in powerful opinions by each of the three dissenting Judges. They took the view that theArticle was that it fixed the situs of the sales with a view to avoid multiple taxation.

(1989) 3 SCC 488, a Constitution Bench of this Court was constituted consisting of R.S. Pathak, C.J., Sabyasachi Mukherji, S. Natarajan, M.N.enkatachaliah and S. Ranganathan, JJ. The question which arose for consideration was the correctness of the decision in Empire Industries Ltd. v. Union of India (1985) 3 SCC 314, which was decided by a Bench consisting of three-Judges, namely S. Murtaza Fazal Ali, S. Varadarajan, and Sabyasachi Mukherji, JJ. Sabyasachi Mukherji, J. delivered the judgment on his behalf and S. Murtaza Fazal Ali, J. Varadarajan partly concurred. The matter was referred to examine the correctness of the view of Justice Sabyasachi Mukherji expressed forEmpire Industries Ltd. v. Union of India (supra). The view taken in the previous decision by Sabyasachi Mukherji, J., was. It was a case where the correctness of the view taken in Empire Industries case (supra) on certain aspects was doubted by another Bench of this Court in M/s. Ujagar Prints v. Union of India (1986) Supp. SCC 652. Accordingly, the matter was referred to a five-judge Bench. Sabyasachi Mukherji, J. was one of the members offirmed his decision in the Empire Industries case (supra). 17. There is yet another instance of a Constitution Bench which comprised of Y.V. Chandrachud, C.J., P.N. Bhagwati, S. Murtaza Fazal Ali, Amarendra Nath Sen, P. Balakrishna Eradi, JJ. in the matter of Gyan Devi Anand v. Jeevan Kumar & Ors. (1985) 2 SCC 683, where the question which arose was whether statutory tenancy is heritable. In (supra), the correctness of the decision in Ganpat Ladha v. Sashikant Vishnu Shinde, (1978) 2 SCC 573 came up for consideration. The decision in Ganpat Ladha’s case had been overruled, and Damadilal v. Parashram, (1976) 4 SCC 855 was affirmed. The Court has observed thus: “35. In our opinion, the view expressed by this Court in Ganapat Ladha v. Sashikant Vishnu Shinde, (1978) 2 SCC 573 and the observations made therein which we have earlier quoted, do not. The said decision does not properly construe the definition of the ‘tenant’ as given in Section 5(11)(b) of the Act and does not consider the status of the tenant, as defined in the Act, even after termination of the commercial tenancy. In our judgment in Damadilal v. Parashram, (1976) 4 SCC 855, A B D E F G H 1103 this Court has correctly appreciated the status and the legal position. We have quoted at length the view of this Court and the reasons in support thereof. The view expressedDhanapal Chettiar v.

Justice P.N. Bhagwati concurred with the view and overruled his own decision in Ganpat Ladha’s case (supra). Justice Bhagwati has observed thus: “3.

Union of India & Ors. (1995) 5 SCC 338, a three-Judge Bench of this Court consisting of A.M. Ahmadi, C.J., S.P. Bharucha, and K.S. Paripoornan, JJ. doubted the correctness of the view taken in Khandelwal Metal & Engineering Works v. Union of India (1985) 3 SCC 620 and referred the matter to a larger Bench.

It is significant to note that S.P. Bharucha, J., who had doubted the correctness of the decision and referred the matter to a Constitution Bench, has overruled 21. In M/s. Cloth Traders (P) Ltd. v. Additional C.I.T., Gujarat- I, (1979) 3 SCC 538, a three-Judge Bench consisting of P.N. Bhagwati, D.A. Desai, and A.D. Koshal, JJ. decided the question of inter-corporate dividends. The correctness of this decision was taken up for considerationY.V. Chandrachud, C.J., P.N. Bhagwati, Amarendra Nath Sen, D.P. Madon, M.P. Thakkar, JJ. in Distributors (Baroda) Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India & Ors., (1986) 1 SCC 43, in which the decision in M/s. Cloth Traders (P) Ltd. v. Addl. CIT, Gujarat (supra), was overruled. P.N. Bhagwati, J. delivered the judgment for the Constitution Bench. He was also the author of the earlier judgmentM/s. Cloth Traders (P) Ltd. v. Addl. CIT, Gujarat (supra), which had been overruled. This Court has observed thus: “19. But, even if in our view the decision in M/s. Cloth Traders (P) Ltd. v. Additional C.I.T., Gujarat-I, (1979) 3 SCC 538 is erroneous, the question still remains whether we should overturn. But there may be circumstances where public interest demands that A B D E F G H 1105 earlier decision, if it is satisfied that such decision is manifestly. United States 333 US 611: “I see no reason why I should be consciously wrong today because.” Lord Denning also said to the same effect when he observed in Ostime v. Australian Mutual Provident Society (1960) AC 549: “The doctrine of precedent does not compel Your Lordships to follow the wrong path until you fall over the edge of the cliff.” Here we find thatCloth Traders case (supra). In the first place, the decision in Cloth Traders case (supra) was rendered by this Court on May 4, 1979 and immediately thereafter, within a few months, Parliament introduced Section 80-AA withfect from April 1, 1968 with a view to overriding the interpretation placed on Section 80-M in Cloth Traders case (supra). The decision in Cloth Traders case (supra) did not therefore hold the field for a period of more than a few months,Cloth Traders case (supra), and there was therefore no authoritative pronouncement of thisCloth Traders case (supra), was that of the Gujarat High Court in Addl. CIT v. Cloth Traders Pvt. Ltd. (1974) 97 ITR 140 (Guj.) and that decision took precisely the same view which we are inclined to accept inCloth Traders case was overturned by us. If despite the decision of the Gujarat High CourtAddl. CIT v. Cloth Traders Pvt. Ltd. the assessee proceeded on the assumption, now found to be erroneous, that the Gujarat INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS. [ARUN MISHRA, J.] A B D E F G H 1106 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. High Court decision was wrong and the deduction permissible, no prudent assessee could have proceeded to make its financial arrangements on the basis that the decision of the Gujarat, we find, for reasons we have already discussed, that the decision in Cloth Traders case is manifestly wrong because it has failed to take into account a, namely, that the deduction required to be made under sub-section (1) of Section 80-M is not from the gross totalCloth Traders case, and that is the decision in Cambay Electric Supply Co. case (1978) 2 SCC 644. The decision in Cloth Traders case is inconsistent with that in Cambay Electric Supply Co. case. Both cannot stand together. If one is correct, the other must logically be wrong and vice versa. It is therefore necessary to resolve the conflict betweenCloth Traders case. It is for this reason that we have reconsidered and reviewed the decision in Cloth Traders case, and on such reconsideration and review, we have come to the conclusion that the decision in Cloth Traders case is erroneous and must be overturned.” This Court has observed that law should be settled permanently and that it should be settled correctly. There may be circumstances where public interest demands that the previous decision be reviewed 22. Petlad Turkey Red Dye Works Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay North, Ahmedabad (1963) Supp. 1 SCR 871 came up for consideration in Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner A B D E F G H 1107 of Income Tax, Bombay North, Ahmedabad (1965) 2 SCR 908. The Constitution Bench comprised of seven-Judges in Keshav Mills Co. Ltd., M. Hidayatullah, J. was part of the Bench in both the matters. There are other instances which have been cited indicating the practice 23. Shri Mohan Parasaran learned Senior Counsel has submitted that practice of the Court is the law of the Court and binding and should. He referred to the decision of Jamal Uddin Ahmad v. Abu Saleh Najmuddin, (2003) 4 SCC 257, which held thus: “18. Sub-section (1) of the abovesaid provision required the.

[ARUN MISHRA, J.] A B D E F G H 1108 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. Court. Every Court is the guardian of its own records and the master of its own practice; and where a practice has existed, it is convenient, except in cases of extreme urgency and necessity, to adhere to it, because it is the practice, even though no reason can be assigned for it; for an inveterate practice in law generally stands upon principles that are founded in justice and convenience.

Shri Mohan Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel has also relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court of United States in John Patrick LITEKY v. United States, 510 U.S. 540 (1994), where the question of recusal based on “extrajudicial source” doctrine came up for “[5] [6] [7] The judge who presides at a trial may, upon completion of the evidence, be exceedingly ill disposed towards the defendant,s task. As Judge Jerome Frank pithily put it: “Impartiality is not gullibility. Disinterestedness does not mean child-like innocence. If the Judge did not form judgments of the actors inre J.P.

It is the only common basis, but not the exclusive one, since it is not the exclusive reason aA favourable or unfavourable predisposition can also deserve to be characterizede.g., Davis v. Board of School Comm’rs of Mobile County, 517 F.2d 1044, 1051 (CA5 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1685, 48 L.Ed.2d 188As we have described it, however, there is not much doctrine to the doctrine. The fact that an opinion held by a judge derives from anecessary condition for “bias or prejudice” recusal, since predisposition developed duringsufficient condition for “bias or prejudice” recusal, since some opinions acquired outside the context of judicial proceedings (fors view of the law acquired in scholarly reading) will not suffice. Since neither the presence of an extrajudicial source necessarily establishes bias, nor the absence of anfactor, than of an “extrajudicial source” doctrine, in recusal jurisprudence. [15] [16] [17] [18] The facts of the present case do not requireUnited States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S., at 583, 86 S.Ct., at 1710. In and of themselves (i.e., apart from INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS. [ARUN MISHRA, J.] A B D E F G H 1110 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. surrounding comments or accompanying opinion), they cannotAlmost invariably, they are proper grounds for appeal, not for recusal. Second, opinions formed by the judge onmay do so if they reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial source; and they will do so if they reveal such a high degree of favouritism or antagonism as to make fair judgmentAn example of the latter (and perhaps of the former as well) is the statement that was alleged to have been made byBerger v. United States, 255 U.S. 22, 41 S.Ct.230, 65 L.Ed.481 (1921), a World War I espionage case against German-American defendants; “One must have a very.” Id., at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted). Not establishing bias or partiality, however, are expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger, that are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women, even after having. A judge’s ordinary efforts at courtroom administration – even a stern ands ordinary efforts at courtroom administration – remain immune.tates v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 86 S.Ct.1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966). Respondents in Grinnell alleged that the trial judge had a personal bias against them, and sought his A B D E F G H 1111 prejudice”. In denying respondents’ claim, the Court stated thatLITEKY (supra), it has been held that it is desirable to have the same Judge in the successive causes. They have to be faithful to oath. “ To take a common example, litigants (like petitioners here) often seek disqualification based upon a judge’s prior participation, in a judicial capacity, in some related litigation. Those allegations are meritless in most instances, and their prompt rejection is important so the case can proceed. Judges, if faithful to their oath, approach every aspect of each case with a neutral and objective disposition. They understand their duty to render decisions upon a proper record and to disregard earlier judicial contacts with a case or party. Some may argue that a judge will feel the “motivation to vindicate, Disqualification of Judges for Prior Judicial Actions, 3 How.L.J. 228, 229-230 (1957). Still, we accept the notion that the, and, by that very self-knowledge, nullify their effect.” In re J.P. Linahan, Inc., 138 F.2d 650, 652 (CA2 1943). The acquired skill and capacity to disregard extraneous matters is one of the requisites of judicial office. As a matter of sound administration, moreover, it may be necessary and prudent to permit judges to preside over successive causes involving the same parties or issues. See Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts, Rule 4(a)s trial and sentenced him, or, if the judge who imposed sentence was not the trial judge, then it shall go to the judge who was in charge of that part of the INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS. [ARUN MISHRA, J.] A B D E F G H 1112 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. Out of this reconciliation of principle and practice comes the recognition that a judge’s prior judicial experience and contacts need not, and often do not, give rise to reasonable questions concerning impartiality.” (emphasis supplied) 25. In State of W.B. v. Shivananda Pathak, (1998) 5 SCC 513, this Court has laid down that prejudging question of law, policy or discretion, Judge is not disqualified to hear a case. It was held as under: “25.

It is, in fact, a condition of Bias has many forms. It may be pecuniary bias, personal bias, bias as to subject-matter in dispute, or policy bias etc. In theWe have to deal, as we shall presently see, a new form of bias, namely, bias on account of judicial obstinacy. 27. Judges, unfortunately, are not infallible. As human beings, they can commit mistakes even in the best of their judgments reflective, impartial things and objective assessment of the problem put before them. In the matter of interpretation of If a judgment is overruled by the higher court, the judicial discipline requires that the judge whose judgment is overruled must A B D E F G H 1113 judgment, not only binds the parties to the proceedings but also. 29. As pointed out earlier, an essential requirement of judicial adjudication is that the judge is impartial and neutral and is in atates in Linahan, In re, 138 F 2d 650 says: , ‘bias’ and ‘partiality’ be defined to mean the total absence of preconceptions in the mind of the judge, then no one, is no blank piece of paper. We are born with predispositions…. Much harm is done by the myth that, merelyPrinciples of Administrative Law (1973 Edn.), p. 155; Judicial Review of Administrative Action by de Smith (1980 Edn.), p. 272; II Administrative Law Treatise by Davis (1958 Edn.), p. 130.] These remarks imply a distinction between prejudging of facts specifically relating to a party, as against preconceptions or predispositions about general questions of law, policy or discretion. The implication is that though in the former case, a judge would disqualify himself, in the latter case, he may not. But this question does not arise here and is left as it is.” (emphasis supplied) 26. In Asok Pande v. Supreme Court of India, (2018) 5 SCC 341, question of allocation of work and roster of Benches came up for INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS.

Quite apart from the fact that the relief sought is contrary to legal and constitutional principle, there is a fundamental fallacy in A B D E F G H 1115 the approach of the petitioner, which must be set at rest.

There is no constitutional foundation on the basis of which, this would intrude into the exclusive duty and authority of the Chief Justice to constitute Benches and to allocate, the petitioner seems to harbour a misconception that certain categories of cases or certain courtsArticle 124 of the Constitution is invested with the equal duty of adjudicating.

Different High Courts have their own traditions in regard to the period for which the published roster will continue, until a fresh roster is notified. Individual Judges have their own strengths in terms of specialisation. The Chief Justice of the High Court has to bear in mind the area of specialisation of each Judge, while deciding upon the allocation of work. However, specialisation is one of several aspects which weigh with the Chief Justice. A newly appointed Judge may be rotated in a variety of assignments to enable the Judge to acquire expertise in diverse branches of law. Together with the need for specialisation, there is a need for Judges to have a broadbased.

It was vehemently urged by learned senior counsel on behalf of the respondents that they may feel embarrassed in arguing a propositionAuthority elaborately. We find that given that arguments on recusal, spilling for over a day, could be made vociferously, in a belligerent fashion and with utmost ability, the submission that the learned counsel would feel diffident in arguing a proposition of law on merits, is difficult to accept. We feel that there is no dearth of talent in this Court to argue a matter most. This Court is known for not a particular view but for refining the law and that has. That is how the process goes on as the entire system exists for the people of this country. Under the guise of that, a reasonable man should not have even an iotaTribunal. If recusal is made, it would tantamount to giving room to unscrupulous litigant to have a Judge of 33.

The Court has discussed the matter thus: “12. Grant Hammond, a former Judge of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand and an academician, in his book titled Judicial Recusal traced out principles on the law of recusal as developed in England in the following words: “The central feature of the early English common law on recusal, which provided for recusal if a Judge was suspected of partiality because of consanguinity, affinity, friendship or enmity with a party, or because of his subordinate status towards a party or because he was or had been a party’s advocate.” He also pointed out that in contrast in the United States of America, the subject is covered by legislation.

A year later, Dimes discovered that Lord Chancellor Cottenham had shares in the defendant Company. He petitioned the Queen for her intervention. The litigation had a long, the details of which are not material for us. Eventually, the matter reached the House of Lords. The House dismissed the appeal of Dimes on the ground that setting aside ofice-Chancellor intact as Lord Chancellor had merely affirmed the order of the Vice-Chancellor. However, the House of Lords held that participation of Lord Cottenham in the adjudicatoryDimes case, ER p. 315) “… No one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be, in theAnd that is not to be confined to a cause in which he is a party, but applies to a cause in which he has an interest. … This will be a lesson to all inferior tribunals to take care not 14. Summing up the principle laid down by the abovementioned case, Hammond observed as follows: “The ‘no-pecuniary interest’ principle as expressed in Dimes requires a judge to be automatically disqualified when there isDimes is therefore predicated on a conflict of interest approach.” INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS. [ARUN MISHRA, J.] A B D E F G H 1124 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. 15. The next landmark case on the question of “bias” is R. v. Gough, 1993 AC 646. Gough was convicted for an offence of conspiracy to rob and was sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen. After the conviction was announced, it was brought to the notice of the trial court thatAppeal unsuccessfully. One of the grounds on which the conviction was challenged was that, in view of theThe Court of Appeal noticed that there are two lines of authority propounding two different tests for determining1) “real danger” test; and (2) “reasonable suspicion” test. The Court of Appeal confirmed the conviction by applying the “real danger” test. 16. The matter was carried further to the House of Lords. Lord Goff noticed that there are a series of authorities which are “notge in number but bewildering in their effect”. After analysing the judgment in Dimes, Lord Goff held: (Gough case, AC p. 661 F-G) “In such a case, therefore, not only is it irrelevant that there, whether there was any real likelihood of bias, or any reasonable In other words, where a Judge has a pecuniary interest, no furtherGough case, AC pp. 661 G-H-662 A-B) “… But [in other cases], the inquiry is directed to the question A B D E F G H 1125 part of the tribunal that the court will not allow the decision to 17. The learned Judge examined various important cases on the subject and finally concluded: (Gough case, AC p. 670 E-G) “… Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, I prefer to state the test in terms of real danger rather than real likelihood, to ensureAccordingly, having ascertained the relevant circumstances, the court should ask itself whether, having regard to those circumstances, there was a real danger of bias on the, or disfavour, the case of a party to the issue under consideration by him….” 18. Lord Woolf agreed with Lord Goff in his separate judgment. He held: (Gough case, AC p. 673 F-G) “… There is only one established special category and thatDimes v. Grand Junction Canal. The courts should hesitate long before creating any other special category since this will immediately create. The real danger test is quite capable of producing the right 19. In substance, the Court held that in cases where the Judge has a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the proceedings, his INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS. [ARUN MISHRA, J.] A B D E F G H 1126 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. interest lead to a “real danger” or gave rise to a “reasonable. In cases of other interest, the test to determine whether the Judge is disqualified to hear the case is the The R. v.

Subsequently, it came to light that Lord Hoffman, one of the members of the Board which heard, was a Director and Chairman of a company (known as AICL) which was closely linked with Amnesty International. An application was made to the House of Lords to set aside the earlier judgment on the ground of bias on the part of The House of Lords examined the following questions: (i) Whether the connection of Lord Hoffman with Amnesty International required him to be automatically disqualified?ii) Whether an enquiry into the question whether cause of Lord Hoffman’s connection with Amnesty International posed a real danger or caused a reasonable apprehension that his judgment isiii) Did it make any difference that Lord Hoffman was only a member of a company associated with Amnesty International which was in fact interested in securing the extradition of Senator Lord Wilkinson summarised the principles on which a Judge is disqualified to hear a case. As per Lord Wilkinson: (Pinochet case, AC pp. 132 G-H-133 A-C) “The fundamental principle is that a man may not be a Judge A B D E F G H 1127 has two very similar but not identical implications. First it may. This second type of case is not strictly speaking an application of the principle that a man must not be Judge in his, he is disqualified without any investigation into whether there was a likelihood or suspicion of bias. The mere And framed the question: (AC p. 134B-C), in non-financial litigation, anything other than a financial or proprietary interest in the outcomeautomatically to disqualify a man from sitting as Judge in the cause.” (emphasis supplied) He opined that although the earlier cases have Lord Wilkinson concluded that Amnesty International and its associate company known as AICL, had a non-pecuniary interest INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v.

After so concluding, dealing with the last question, whether the fact that Lord Hoffman was only a member of AICL but not a member of Amnesty International made any difference to the principle, Lord Wilkinson opined that: (Pinochet case, AC p. 132H- 133A) even though a Judge may not have financial interest in the and held that: (AC p. 135 E-F) “… If the absolute impartiality of the judiciary is to be maintained, there must be a rule which automatically disqualifies a Judge who is involved, whether personally or as a Director of a company, in promoting the same causes in the same organisation as is a party to the suit. There is no room for fine distinctions….” This aspect of the matter was considered in P.D. Dinakaran (1) v. Judges Inquiry Committee, (2011) 8 SCC 380 25. From the above decisions, in our opinion, the following principles emerge: If a Judge has a financial interest in the outcome of a case, he is automatically disqualified from hearing the case. In cases where the interest of the Judge in the case is other than financial, then the disqualification is not automatic but an A B D E F G H 1129 disqualifies the Judge tested in the light of either on the principle The Pinochet case added a new category i.e. that the Judge is automatically disqualified from hearing a case where the Judge It is nobody’s case that, in the case at hand, Justice Khehar had any pecuniary interest or any other interest falling under the The question is whether the principle of law laid down in Pinochet case is attracted.

For that would give the impression, of the Judge had been scared out of the case, just by the force of the objection. A Judge before he assumes his office, takes an oath to discharge his duties without fear or favour. He would breach his oath of office, if he accepts a prayer for recusal, unless justified. It is my duty to discharge my responsibility with absolute earnestness and sincerity. It is my duty to abide by my oath of office to uphold the Constitution and the laws. My decision to continue to be a part of the Bench, flows from the oath which I took, at the time of my elevation to this Court. (emphasis supplied) Justice Lokur, in his opinion, has observed: “60. In my respectful opinion, when an application is made for the recusal of a Judge from hearing a case, the application is INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS.

The questions thrown up are quite significant and since, it is time that some procedural and substantive rules are framed in this concerned, and unjustified pressure should never be allowed. 35. Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General, has relied upon the decision in Subrata Roy Sahara v. Union of India & Ors., (2014) 8 SCC 470. Recusal of the Bench was sought by way of filing a petition., concept of correction of a mistake, if any, recognition of mistake and its rectification have also been considered. This Court has observed: “7. Now the embarrassment part.

It is the Constitution of India which enjoins a Judge to duly and faithfully and, knowledge, and judgment, perform the duties of his office without fear or favour. Affronts, jibes, and consciously planned snubs should not deter us from discharging our onerous responsibility. This Court has observed: “10. We have recorded the above narration, lest we are accused of not correctly depicting the submissions as they were canvassedAnd not to be overawed by such submissions. In our view, not hearing the matter, would constitute an act in breach of our oath of office, which mandates us to performfice, to the best of our ability, without fear or favour, affection or ill will. 11.

We could at any time during the course of hearing walk out and make way for another Bench to decide the matter, if ever we felt that that would be the righteous course to follow.

Forum shopping takes several hues and shades ands petitions do not fall under any category of forum shopping. 148. A classic example of forum shopping is when a litigant approaches one Court for relief but does not get the desired reliefRajiv Bhatia v. State (NCT of Delhi), (1999) 8 SCC 525. The respondent mother of a young child had filed a petition. In Arathi Bandi v. Bandi Jagadrakshaka Rao, (2013) 15 SCC 790, this Court noted that jurisdiction in a court is not. Another case of creating circumstances for the purposes of forum shopping was World Tanker Carrier Corpn. v. SNP Shipping Services (P) Ltd., (1998) 5 SCC 310, wherein it was observed that the respondent-plaintiff had made a deliberate, a collision between two vessels on the high seas within the jurisdiction of the Bombay A B D E F G H 1139 151.

To borrow the words of Beverely Mclachlin (Chief Justice of Canada) (“Judging in a Democratic State”) : “…judges are not living Oracles. They are human beings,, who struggle to understand the situations before them and to resolve them in accordance with the lawAnd judges must learn to live with being wrong.

The approach to be adopted by other members of the Bench to this sensitive issue- in such cases, is best summarized in the view ofSupreme Court Advocates-on-Record- Association and Ors. vs. Union of India 2016 (5) 808 where it was stated as follows: “In my respectful opinion, when an application is made for the recusal of a judge from hearing a case, the application is made to the concerned judge and not to the Bench as a whole.efore, my learned brother Justice Khehar is absolutely correct in stating that the decision is entirely his, and I respect his decision. 539. In a detailed order pronounced in Court on its own motion v. State and Ors. reference was made to a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Jewell Ridge Coal Corporation v. Local No. 6167, United Mine Workers of America 325 US 897 (1945), wherein it was held that a complaint as to the qualification of a justice of the Supreme Court to take part in the decision of a cause cannot properly be addressed to the Court as a whole and it is the responsibility of each justice to determine for himself the propriety of withdrawing from a case. 540. This view was adverted to by Justice Rehnquist in. Hampton 446 US 1301 (1980) in the following words: * Ed. Note : Order passed by Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, M.R. Shah, and S. Ravindra Bhat, JJ. A B D E F G H 1145 ‘Plaintiffs-Respondents and their counsel in these cases haveecused from the proceedings in this case for the reasons stated in their 14-page motion and their five appendices filed with the Clerk of this Court on April 3, 1980.essed to it, to the decision of the individual Justices to whom they refer, see Jewell Ridge Coal Corporation v. Mine Workers 325 U.S. 897 (1945) (denial of petition for rehearing) (Jackson, J., concurring), I shall treat the motion as addressed to me individually. I have considered the motion, the Appendices, the response of the state Defendants, 28 U.S.C. 455 (1976 ed. And Supp. II), and the current American Bar Association Code of Judicial Conduct, and the motion is accordingly denied.’ ecusal may be looked at slightly differently apart from the legal nuance. What would happen if, in a Bench of five judges, an application is moved for the recusal of Judge A and after hearing the application Judge A decidesecuse from the case but the other four judges disagree and express the opinion that there is no justifiable reason for Judge A to recuse from the hearing? Can Judge A be compelled to hear the case even though he/she is desirous of recusing from the hearing? It is to get over such a difficult situation that the application for recusal is actually to an individual judge and not the Bench as a whole.As far as the view expressed by Justice Kurian Joseph that reasons should be given while deciding an application for recusal, I would prefer not to join that decision. In the first place, giving or not giving reasons was not an issue be- fore us. That reasons are presently being given is a different matter altogether. Secondly, the giving of reasons is fraught with some difficulties. For example, it is possible that in aecusal from a case and one of the parties challenges that order in this Court. Upon hearing the parties, this Court comes to the conclusion that the reasons INDORE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. MANOHAR LAL & ORS. A B D E F G H 1146 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 15 S.C.R. given by the learned judge were frivolous and therefore the order is incorrect and is then set aside. In such an event, can this Court pass a consequential order requiring the learned judge to hear the case even though he/she genuinely believes In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the view of Mishra, J, to reject the application for recusal, is not a matter that can be 4. With respect to the observations by Mishra, J in his opinion, regarding the legal principles applicable, we are of the considered view 5. We notice that his order has cited several previous instances where judges who rendered decisions in smaller bench compositions, 6. For those and other reasons mentioned in the order of Mishra, J, we concur with his reasoning and conclusions that no legal principle or, i.e. that the judge who decided a previous cause, finally, can – and very often has- participated in the later, larger bench to which such previous decision is referred for reconsideration. 7. For the above reasons, and having regard to the reasons contained in Mishra, J’s order, outlining the rejection of the request for his recusal, we are of the considered opinion that this Bench should Reference to be heard on merits by the Bench.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
