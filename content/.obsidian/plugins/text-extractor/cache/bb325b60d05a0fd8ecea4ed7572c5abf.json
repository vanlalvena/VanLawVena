All the engineering works of local self-government were entrusted to LSGED. By the Notification dated 18-6-1975 issued under Section 3 of the U.P.

Subsequently, in exercise of the powers conferred under Sections 97(1) and 97(2)(c) of the 1975 Act, and with the previous approval of the State Government , the Nigam made the U.P. Jal Nigam Services of Engineers (Public Health Branch) Regulations, 1978 (the 1978 Regulations) for regulating the recruitment to the posts and the conditions of service of persons appointed to the Jal Nigam Engineers (Public Health Branch). The said 1978 Regulations were made equally applicable to the employees transferred and merged from the erstwhile LSGED and the employees directly recruited by the Nigam and they came into force w.e.f. 27-4-1978. Regulation 31 related to pay, allowance , pension, leave and other conditions of service. There was no separate provision for the age of superannuation of the employees of the Nigam prescribed under the 1978 Regulations. As per Regulation 31, the terms and conditions of service of the employees of the Nigam were to be governed by the same rules, regulations and orders generally applicable to the employees of the State Government and hence the retirement and superannuation age of the employees of the Nigam was stipulated as 58 years in terms of Rule 56(a) of the U.P. Fundamental Rules. Rule 56(a) of the Fundamental Rules was amended vide Notification dated 27-6-2002 and the age of superannuation of the State Government employees was enhanced from 58 years to 60 years which was to come into force on 28-11-2001. However, benefit of such enhancement of age of superannuation was not given to the employees of the Nigam. Writ petitions were preferred by the employees of the Nigam who were being sought to be retired on completing the age of 58 years. The Supreme Court in Harwindra Kumar, (2005) 13 SCC 300 granted the benefit of the Notification dated 27-6-2002 to the petitioners. Thereafter the Nigam framed the U.P. Jal Nigam Employees (Retirement on Attaining Age of Superannuation) Regulations, 2005. By Regulation 3 the retirement age of 60 years was provided for the employees and engineers who were employed in the erstwhile LSGED and who were transferred and merged in the Nigam while Regulation 4, prescribed a separate age of superannuation at the age of 58 years for all other employees who were directly appointed in the Nigam. A number of employees of the Nigam who were affected filed writ petitions challenging the said Regulation 4, which was allowed and the petitioners were allowed to continue in service till the age of 60 years and the said Regulation 4 to the extent it provided the superannuation age of 58 years for employees directly recruited, was declared non est. In an appeal filed thereagainst, the Division Bench of the High Court stayed the declaration but so far as the writ petitioners were concerned, no interim orders were passed and as such, they were allowed to discharge their duties up to the age of 60 years. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed thereagainst relying on its earlier decision rendered in Harwindra Kumar case. Subsequently, the Nigam vide its Resolution dated 13-4-2008 resolved to enhance the age of superannuation of the employees, irrespective of their source of entry , to 60 years and forwarded the same to the Government for approval.

In the writ petitions filed by the employees of the Nigam challenging the same, the High Court by the impugned judgment declared the 2005 Regulations unconstitutional as it created two classes of employees in determining two separate retirement ages in the absence of any intelligible differentia. Hence , the instant appeal. Dismissing the appeal, the Supreme Court Held: The Supreme Court in Harwindra Kumar case had held that so long as Regulation 31 is not amended, 60 years which is the age of superannuation of the government servants shall be applicable to the employees of the Nigam. However, in contravention of finding of the Supreme Court without amending Regulation 31, new Regulations 3 and 4 of the 2005 Regulations were framed by the Nigam prescribing two separate ages of superannuation for similarly situated employees. Since the creation of the Nigam, irrespective of the source of recruitment, the employees of the Nigam were treated alike for the purpose of superannuation. Subsequently, solely on the basis of source of recruitment no discrimination can be made and differential treatment would not be permissible in the matter of condition of service, including the age of superannuation, in absence of any intelligible differentia distinguishing them from each other. The High Court by the impugned judgment rightly declared the 2005 Regulations unconstitutional and ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution. (Paras 30, 32 and 34) Prem Chand Somchand Shah v.

DAYANAND CHAKRAWARTY 599 The State Government's Order dated 29-6-2009 prescribing a uniform age of superannuation at 58 years for the employees working in the government companies and government corporations cannot prevail over statutory Regulation 31 framed by the Nigam under Section 97(2)(c) of the 1975 Act with the previous approval of the State Government. Therefore, the employees of the Nigam shall not be guided by the State Government's Order dated 29-6-2009 but will continue in the services up to the age of 60 years, in view of Regulation 31, having not yet amended or repealed. Furthermore, in Harwindra Kumar case the Supreme Court has already held that it is not possible for the Nigam to take an administrative decision pursuant to the direction of the State Government in the matter of policy issued under Section 89 of the 1975 Act and direct that the age of superannuation of 60 years applicable to the government servants shall not be applicable to the employees of the Nigam. In view of such finding the Nigam cannot act on the basis of the State Government's Order dated 29-6-2009 providing a uniform age of superannuation at 58 years. (Paras 37 and 38) Harwindra Kumar v. Chief Engineer, Karmik, (2005) 13 SCC 300 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 1063, followed As far as consequential benefits to which the respondents are entitled are concerned, the High Court en-ed in determining back wages of the respondents restricting it to be 20% of the basic salary. The principle of \"no work no pay\" is not applicable to the employees who were guided by specific rules like Leave Rules, etc. relating to absence from duty. Such principle can be applied to only those employees who were not guided by any specific rule relating to absence from duty. If an employee is prevented by the employer from performing his duties, the employee cannot be blamed for having not worked, and the principle of \"no work no pay\" shall not be applicable to such employee. In view of the finding that Regulation 31 shall be applicable and the age of superannuation of employees of the Nigam shall be 60 years, the employees including the respondents who moved a court of law in-espective of the fact whether interim order was passed in their favour or not, shall be entitled to full aiTears of salary up to the age of 60 years. The employees, who never moved any court of law and had to retire on attaining the age of superannuation, shall not be entitled for aITears of salary. However, in view of Regulation 31 they will deem to have continued in service up to the age of 60 years. In their case, the appellants shall treat the age of superannuation as 60 years, and re-fix their retiral benefits accordingly. (Paras 48 and 49) Harwindra Kumar V.

In its second meeting dated 4-4-1977 vide Agenda Item 2.21 the Board b of Nigam resolved that all the provisions of Financial Handbook, Manual of Government Order, Civil Services Regulations, Government Servant Rules and other government orders shall be applicable to the employees of the Nigam, provided the Nigam has not passed any other order. 9. Initially, in exercise of the powers conferred under sub-section (1) and clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 97 of the 1975 Act and with the C previous approval of the State Government, the Nigam made regulations for regulating the recruitment to the posts and the conditions of service of the persons appointed to the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam Service of Engineers (Public Health Branch) known as \"the Uttar Pradesh Service of Engineers (Public Health Branch) Regulations, 1977\". 10. Subsequently, in exercise of the powers conferred under sub-section d (1) and clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 97 of the 1975 Act, and with the previous approval of the State Government, the Nigam made the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam Services of Engineers (Public Health Branch) Regulations, 1978 (hereinafter referred to as \"the 1978 Regulations\") for regulating the recruitment to the posts and the conditions of service of persons appointed to the Jal Nigam Engineers (Public Health Branch). The e said 1978 Regulations were made equally applicable to the employees transferred and merged from the erstwhile LsGED and the employees directly recruited by the Nigam and it came into force w.e.f. 27-4-1978. Regulation 31 relates to pay, allowance, pension, leave and other conditions of service which reads as follows: \"31.

The age of retirement of the State Government employees as per Rule 56(a) of the Uttar Pradesh Fundamental Rules was 58 years. In the year 2001, the State Government vide its Official Order No. 1098/A-1/2001 dated 28-11-2001 informed of its intention to amend clause (a) of Rule 56. Consequently, Rule 56(a) was amended by \"the Uttar Pradesh Fundamental (Amendment) Rules, 2002\" vide Notification dated 27-6-2002, which came into force on 28-11-2001. As per the amended clause (c) of Rule 56, the age of superannuation of the State Government employees was enhanced from 58 years to 60 years, which reads as follows: \"56. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Rule, every government servant shall retire from service on the afternoon of the last day of the month in which he attains the age of sixty years: Provided that a government servant, whose date of birth is the first day of a month, shall retire from service on the afternoon of the last day of the preceding month on attaining the age of sixty years: Provided further that a government servant, who has attained the age of fifty-eight years on or before the first day of November, 2001 and is on extension in service, shall retire from service on expiry of his extended period of service.\" 13. In the meantime, after issuance of the government order expressing its intention to amend clause (a) of Rule 56 by the Notification dated 28-11-2001, the Nigam by its letter dated 31-12-2001 enquired from the State Government as to whether the benefit of enhancement in the age of superannuation from 58 years to 60 years would be applicable to the employees of the Nigam or not. In reply thereto just before the Amendment Rules, 2002, the Special Secretary to the State Government from its Department of Local Self-Government by his letter dated 22-1-2002, conveyed that the employees of the Nigam shall not be entitled to the enhancement of the age of superannuation from 58 years to 60 years as the same would be applicable only to the State Government employees. On receipt of the said letter, on 11-7-2002 the Nigam resolved that enhancement in the age of superannuation from 58 years to 60 years would not be applicable to the employees of the Nigam. 14. Against the decision of the State Government dated 22-1-2002 and the decision of the Nigam vide Office Memorandum dated 11-7-2002 a number of writ petitions were preferred by the employees of the Nigam who were being sought to retire on completing the age of 58 years.

In the present case, as the Regulations have been framed by the Nigam specifically enumerating in Regulation 31 thereof that the Rules governing the service conditions of government servants shall equally apply to the employees of the Nigam, it was not possible for the Nigam to take an administrative decision acting under Section 15(1) of the Act b pursuant to the direction of the State Government in the matter of policy issued under Section 89 of the Act and directing that the enhanced age of superannuation of 60 years applicable to the government servants shall not apply to the employees of the Nigam. In our view, the only option for the Nigam was to make suitable amendment in Regulation 31 with the previous approval of the State Government providing thereunder the age c of superannuation of its employees to be 58 years, in case it intended that 60 years which was the enhanced age of superannuation of the State Government employees should not be made applicable to the employees of the Nigam. It was also not possible for the State Government to give a direction purporting to act under Section 89 of the Act to the effect that the enhanced age of 60 years would not be applicable to the employees d of the Nigam treating the same to be a matter of policy nor was it permissible for the Nigam on the basis of such a direction of the State Government in the policy matter of the Nigam to take an administrative decision acting under Section 15( 1) of the Act as the same would be inconsistent with Regulation 31 which was framed by the Nigam in the exercise of powers conferred upon it under Section 97(2)(c) of the Act. e 10. For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that so long as Regulation 31 of the Regulations is not amended, 60 years which is the age of superannuation of government servants employed under the State of Uttar Pradesh shall be applicable to the employees of the Nigam. However, it would be open to the Nigam with the previous approval of the State Government to make suitable amendment in Regulation 31 and f alter the service conditions of employees of the Nigam, including their age of superannuation. It is needless to say that if it is so done, the same shall be prospective. 11.

After the decision in Hanvindra Kuma,-t>, the Nigam in exercise of its powers conferred under sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 97 of the 1975 Act, framed the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam Employees (Retirement on Attaining Age of Superannuation) Regulations, 2005. It was issued by Office Order dated 8-12-2005 and made effective from 30-8-2005. By Regulation 3 the retirement age of 60 years was provided but for the employees and engineers who were employed in the erstwhile LSGED and who were transferred and merged in the Nigam. In Regulation 4, a separate age of superannuation at the age of 58 years was prescribed for all other employees and engineers, who were not covered under Regulation 3 i.e. those who were directly appointed in the Nigam. 16. Regulations 3 and 4 read as follows: \"Retirement on Attaining Age of Superannuation 3. Age of superannuation of every employee who was employed in the Engineering Department of the Local Self-Government under Section 37(1) of the Act, and has been transferred to the Corporation and is employed in the Corporation, will be 60 years. 4. The age of superannuation of the employees different from those under Rule 3 above, will be 58 years. But the age of superannuation of the Group 'D' employees who have been employed prior to 5-11-1985, will be 60 years.\" 17. After framing the aforesaid 2005 Regulations, the Nigam filed a review petition before this Court being Review Petition No. 24 of 2006, seeking review of decision in Hanvindra Kuma,-t>_ The review petition was dismissed by this Court on 29-8-2006 7 . 18. A number of employees challenged Regulation 4 by filing Writ Petition No. 45800 of 2006, etc. The Allahabad High Court by its common judgment dated 21-5-2007 8 allowed the writ petitions and held that Regulation 4 to the extent it provides superannuation age of 58 years for those employees directly recruited is arbitrary and declared it non est. The writ petitioners were allowed to continue in service till the age of 60 years. 19. As against the aforesaid judgment, the Nigam filed a special appeal before the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court which by order dated 1-8-2007 stayed the declaration given by the learned Single Judge. However, so far as the writ petitioners were concerned, no interim orders were passed in the said special appeal and as such, they were allowed to discharge their duties up to the age of 60 years. 6 Harwindra Kumar v.

But the State Government provided a uniform age for superannuation as 58 years for all employees working in the government companies and d government corporations by its Order dated 29-6-2009. For the said reason, by its Order dated 3-7-2009, the State Government refused to accord approval to the recommendations of the Nigam dated 13-4-2008. 25. On being aggrieved by the said action of the State Government the employees of the Nigam preferred the writ petitions in question before the Allahabad High Court. A number of writ petitions were heard together and e disposed of by the common impugnedjudgment dated 29-7-2010 1. The other writ petitions which were taken up or filed subsequently were disposed of by the impugned separate orders in terms with the common judgment dated 29- 7-2010 1. 26.

The classification between the employees of the Local Self- Government Engineering Department transferred to the Nigam and the employees directly recruited by the Nigam, in prescribing different age of superannuation is valid and reasonable. 27.4. The High Court was not justified in setting aside the Jal Nigam Employees (Retirement on Attaining Age of Superannuation) Regulations, 2005 in absence of any challenge to the power of the Nigam to frame the regulations particularly when the petitioners only challenged the Regulation. 27 .5. The High Court committed an error of law in not considering Section 37(1) of the 1975 Act, which protects the terms and conditions of the service of the employees of erstwhile Local Self-Government Engineering Department who were transferred to the Nigam on its creation. 27.6. The question of determination of age of superannuation is a matter of policy of the State Government or the competitive authority of a corporation, and the High Court under Article 226 cannot determine the age of superannuation. 28. Thus, from a detailed analysis and close examination of facts relating to the condition of service of employees of the Nigam starting from its constitution till today, the following facts emerge: 28.1. The question relating to the age of superannuation of the employees of the Nigam stood finally concluded on 18-11-2005 when this Court rendered decision in Harwindra Kumar°. 28.2. After the judgment in Harwindra Kumar° based on liberty given by this Court, the Nigam framed the 2005 Regulations prescribing two separate ages of superannuation for the employees of the Nigam, without amending Regulation 31. The Nigam subsequently by the Resolution dated 13-4-2008 proposed to amend the 2005 Regulations prescribing the common age of 60 years for superannuation for all the employees of the Nigam. The State Government by its Order dated 29-6-2009 prescribed the uniform age of superannuation as 58 years for all the employees working in the government undertakings i.e. government companies and government corporations and then in view of such decision, the State Government refused to accord approval to the recommendations of the Nigam dated 13-4-2008 by its Letter dated 3-7-2009. 29. In view of the subsequent development after the decision rendered in Harwindra Kumar case 6 , again the question of age of superannuation of employees of the Nigam has been reopened keeping in view of such fact, the question required to be determined as raised in these cases. 30.

In Prem Chand Somchand Shah v. Union of India 12 this Court held: (SCC p. 56, para 8) \"8. As regards the right to equality guaranteed under Article 14 the position is well settled that the said right ensures equality amongst equals and its aim is to protect persons similarly placed against discriminatory b treatment. It means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Conversely discrimination may result if persons dissimilarly situate are treated equally. Even amongst persons similarly situate differential treatment would be permissible between one class and the other. In that event it is necessary that the differential treatment should be founded on c an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question.\" 32. Since creation of the Nigam, irrespective of source of recruitment, the employees of the Nigam were treated alike for the purpose of superannuation d and were allowed to superannuate at the age of 58 years as is evident from Regulation 31. 33. As per the decision of this Court in Prem Chand Somchand Shah 12 even amongst persons similarly situated differential treatment would be permissible between one class and the other. In that event it is necessary that e the differential treatment should be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute. The appellants, the Nigam as well as the State of Uttar Pradesh failed to place on record the reasons for differential treatment which distinguishes employees of erstwhile LsGED and f those who were appointed directly in the Nigam. 34. Further, as employees appointed from different sources, after their appointment were treated alike for the purpose of superannuation under Regulation 31, subsequently solely on the basis of source of recruitment no discrimination can be made and differential treatment would not be permissible in the matter of condition of service, including the age of g superannuation, in absence of an intelligible differentia distinguishing them from each other. We therefore hold that the High Court by the impugned judgment 1 rightly declared the 2005 Regulations unconstitutional and ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India. h 12 (1991) 2 sec 48 l Dayanand Chakrawarty v.

Regulation 31 of the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam Services of Engineers (Public Health Branch) Regulations, 1978 Special Regulation; it will not be affected by later Regulation 4 of the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam (Retirement on Attaining Age of Superannuation) Regulations, 2005, in absence of express repeal of Special Regulation. By implication it cannot be infened that Regulation 31 stands repealed in view of the subsequent 2005 Regulations. 36. Even if it is treated that both the General Regulation 4 of the 2005 Regulations and Special Regulation 31 of the 1978 Regulations co-exist, one which is advantageous i.e. Regulation 31 shall be applicable to the members of the same service. 37. The State Government's Order dated 29-6-2009 prescribing a uniform age of superannuation at 58 years for the employees working in the government companies and government corporations cannot prevail over statutory Regulation 31 framed by the Nigam under Section 97(2)(c) of the 1975 Act with the previous approval of the State Government. Therefore, the employees of the Nigam shall not be guided by the State Government ' s Order dated 29-6-2009 but will continue in the services up to the age of 60 years, in view of Regulation 31, having not yet amended or repealed. 38. In Harwindra Kumar case 6 this Court already held that it is not possible for the Nigam to take an administrative decision pursuant to the direction of the State Government in the matter of policy issued under Section 89 of the Act and directing that the age of superannuation of 60 years applicable to the government servants shall not be applicable to the employees of the Nigam. In view of such finding of this Court, the Nigam cannot act on the basis of the State Government's Order dated 29-6-2009 providing uniform age of superannuation at 58 years. 39. During the pendency of these appeals further development has taken place. The Government of Uttar Pradesh by its Letter No. 3199/9-3-11- 113C/2011 dated 23-12-2011 informed the Chairman, Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam of its approval to increase the age of superannuation of full-time regular officers/employees of the Nigam from 58 years to 60 years. The State Government directed to make appropriate amendments in the Regulations framed by the Nigam, which read as follows: \"No. 3199/9-3-ll-113C/2011 From: Vijay Bahadur Singh , Special Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh.

This is in reference to your Letter No. 86/P-1/2005-002/11 dated 23-12-2011 and Government Order No. 160/44-1-20911-90/2008 dated a 20-12-2011 of the Public Enterprises Bureau Section, on the above subject. 2. In this regard I have been directed to say that a meeting of the Board of Directors of Jal Nigam was held on 23-12-2011 and it was decided in the said meeting that the age of retirement of full-time regular officers/employees of Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam be increased from 58 years to 60 years. The aforesaid decision of the Board was considered by the Government and b Government has decided that age of full-time regular officers/employees of Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam be increased from 58 years to 60 years. 3. However, the aforesaid increase in the age of retirement will be subject to the condition that all the additional financial burden which will be incurred due to aforesaid increase in the age of retirement, will be borne by the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam from its own resources and no financial c assistance whatsoever will be given by the Government in this regard. 4. I have been further directed to say that appropriate amendments in the rules/regulations/standing orders of the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam pertaining to fixation of the age of retirement of the personnel of the J al Nigam will be made by the J al Nigam on its own.

In view of the finding as recorded above and the State Government's Letter dated 23-12-2011 no interference is called for in the impugned judgment 1, whereby the High Court held the 2005 Regulations unconstitutional, violative of Article 14 and set aside the orders of retirements. 41. An interlocutory application dated 20-3-2013 has been filed by the counsel for the respondent in Civil Appeal No. 5528 of 2012 intimating that the first respondent, Dayanand Chak:rawarty expired on 17-2-2013, during d e f the pendency of the case, leaving behind their legal heirs, Mrs Pramila Chakrawarty (widow), Ms Manisha Chak:rawarty (daughter), Mr Vivekanand Chakrawarty (son), Ms Utpana Chak:rawarty (daughter) and Mr Sampurna Nand Chakrawarty (son). g 42. In view of the observations made in the preceding paragraphs as the employees including the respondents are entitled to get consequential benefits, we allow the petition for substitution to enable the heirs to derive the benefit of the decision of this Court. l Dayanand Chakrawarty v.

Now the question arises as to what consequential benefits to which the respondents and other employees who have not moved before any court a of law shall be entitled? b C d e f g 44. By the impugned judgment 1 the High Court observed: \"Similar benefit is already available to the employees who are continuing in service by virtue of interim order passed by the competent court. They should continue till the age of 60 years. The law helps those who are vigilant and not to those who go to sleep as per maxim vigilantibus, et non dormientibus, jura subveniunt. So, this benefit will not be given to the employees who peacefully retired on attaining the age of 58 years and never came before the Court. But there may be another class of the employees who came before this Court and could not get the interim order but writ petitions were admitted. Admittedly, these employees have not worked. So, on the basis of no pay no work, they will not be entitled for arrears. However, their back wages will be restricted @ 20% of the basic salary as per the ratio laid down in G. Vallikumari v. Andhra Education Society 13. Lastly, it is clarified that the extended service will be counted for all the purpose to the abovementioned employees. The petitions are allowed. No costs.\" 45. In Hanvindra Kumar v. Chief Engineer, Karmr!c6 this Court while allowing the employees of the Nigam to continue till the age of 60 years in view of Regulation 31, ordered that no recovery shall be made from those who continued up to the age of 60 years. This Court further observed that the employees who have not been allowed to continue after completing the age of 58 years by virtue of erroneous decision taken by the Nigam for no fault of theirs, would also be entitled to payment of salary for the remaining period up to the age of 60 years. 46. In UP. Jal Nigam v. Radhey Shyam Gautam9 following the decision in Hanvindra Kumar case 6 , this Court held that the employees of the Nigam shall be entitled for full salary for the remaining period up to the age of 60 years. 47. However, in UP. Jal Nigam v. Jaswant Singh 10, this Court allowed the benefits of arrears of salary only to those employees of the Nigam who had filed writ petitions and denied the same to others who have not moved before a court of law. 48.

We observe that the principle of a \"no pay no work\" is not applicable to the employees who were guided by specific rules like Leave Rules, etc. relating to absence from duty. Such principle can be applied to only those employees who were not guided by any specific rule relating to absence from duty. If an employee is prevented by the employer from performing his duties, the employee cannot be blamed for having not worked, and the principle of \"no pay no work\" shall not be b applicable to such employee. 49. In these cases as we have already held that Regulation 31 shall be applicable and the age of superannuation of employees of the Nigam shall be 60 years; we are of the view that following consequential and pecuniary benefits should be allowed to different sets of employees who were ordered c to retire at the age of 58 years: 49.1. The employees including the respondents who moved before a court of law irrespective of the fact whether interim order was passed in their favour or not, shall be entitled for full salary up to the age of 60 years. The arrears of salary shall be paid to them after adjusting the amount if any paid. 49.2. The employees, who never moved before any court of law and had d to retire on attaining the age of superannuation, they shall not be entitled for arrears of salary. However, in view of Regulation 31 they will deem to have continued in service up to the age of 60 years. In their case, the appellants shall treat the age of superannuation at 60 years, fix the pay accordingly and re-fix the retirement benefits like pension, gratuity, etc. On such calculation, e they shall be entitled for arrears of retirement benefits after adjusting the amount already paid. 49.3. The arrears of salary and a1Tears of retirement benefits should be paid to such employees within four months from the date of receipt of copy of this judgment. 50. The judgment passed by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench dated 29- 7-2010 1 and other impugned judgments stand modified to the extent above. The appeals are disposed of with the aforesaid observations and directions. There shall be no order as to costs. l Dayanand Chakrawarty v.
