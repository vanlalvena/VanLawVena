Among Muhamadans of the Shiah School, a muta marriage is a temporary marriage whose duration is fixed by agreement between the parties, which period , s capable of further extensions. It does not confer on the woman any right or claim to her husband's property but children conceived d11ring its continuance are legitimate and capable of inheriting from their father. A nikah marriage on the other hand is a religious ceremony and confers on the woman the full status of wife; and children born aiter it ai:-e legitimate .

Appeal against the judgment and decree of the High Court of Judi-. cature for the North-West Provinces at Allahabad, dated 9th February 1910, reversing those of the Subordinate Judge of Gorakhpur, dated 27th May 1907. The dispute relates to the property of one Mahomed Kasim deceased; who left behind him surviving three daughters by one Achchhi Bibi, of whom . the plaintiff is the youngest- The defendants are the other two daught~rs and their alienees. Plaintiff's case was that till about one and half years prior to her birth, Mahomed Kasim and · Achchhi · Bibi were not legally married though they lived together as man and, wife, that it was only then that they were so married and that in consequence she alone was the legitimate daughter of her parents and that she was entitled to succeed to seven-eighth of the property of Mahomed Kasim- The defendants on the other hnnd contended that the other two daughters were equally legitimate and that the plaintiff was entitled to inherit only a 7 /24 ths of her father's estate. In proof of her legitimacy the plaintiff produced a deed of dower executed by Ma.bomed Kasim wherein he deolared inter a,lia, that Achchhi Bibi had been living with him £or sorne years past, tha.t hs had contracted muta with her and that owing to certain circumstances performance of nikah ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: The Law Weekly, © 2024 Law Weekly , Chennai.

The Subordinate Judge disposed of the Case on some of the issues only but on appeal the High Court remanded the case for disposal on the other issues also. The case was then heard by the sucessor in office of the subordinate judge who originally treed the case and he held that the deed was a forgery but the Eiil:ifCourt, having before it additional evidence of considerable importance, held_ that the deed was genuine and that the marriage ceremony had really been per- formed. Against this decree the plantiff appealed to His Majesty in Council. Messrs. De Gruyther, K.O., and Dube for the Appellants:-There is nothing .to prove the continuance of muta or performance of nikah. The evidence given by the witnesses is very improbable. The deed of dower has not been proved to have been execute,1 by Ma.homed Kasim and the alienees ought to be protected as bonafide purchasers for value. Mr. Lowndes for the Respondents--The plarintiff, as the only legi- timate, daughter, is entitlied to the share claimed by her and the other two daughters of Ma.homed Kasim have no right to succeed to any portion of the same. Mr, De Gruyther briefly replied. JUDGMENT. Lord Parker of Waddington.-Tbe questions which arise fordecision on this appeal are substantially questions of fact only. Was Muham- ma.d Ka.zim ever married to Achchhi Bibi, and if so, when, and were there any children of the marriage? . There is no doubt tbat Muham- mad Kazim left three daughters by Acbchhi Bibi him surviving, of whom the plaintiff was the youngest, and that those · three daughters• i£ legitimate, were entitled to succeed to his property as co-heirs. But the d,efenda.nts to the action (the now appellants) allege that they were illegitimate, or alternatively that if the plaintiff was lEigitimate, so also were her sisters, so that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed to one-third only of her father 's property. The plaintiff (the now respond- - ent) alleges on the other ban~-th_at although her father and mother lived together as a man and wife for many years, they were married about H- years before she was born and. not earlier, that she, therefore, was his only legitimate child The plaintiff tendered in proof of the marriage of her parents a deed said to have been executed by Muhammad Kasim on the 11th April 1884. a translation of whioh will be found at pttge '90 of th8 record, and a.lso the depositions of several witnesses who deJ)()Sed to the marriage ceremony ha.ving ta.ken place in their pre- eenoe about the same date.

The High Court having before it additional evidence of 'considerable importance came to a contrary conclusion, holding that the deed was genuine and that the marriage ceremony had been per- formed as deposed to by the witnesses. The present appeal is from this decision of the High Court. The deed in question is a deed of dower. In it Muhammad Kasim, who was a Mohamedan of the Shia sect, declared that Aohchhi Bibi . ha.d been living_ with him for some years past, and that he had oontraotel muta with her in the beginning; that owing to their mutual love and affection he had long intended perfoming nika.h with her, but owing to c9rtaio circums:mces, as well as )o the unwillingness of ·some members of his family, he could not do so ; that a suit was recent- ly instituted on his behalf in which his deposition was taken ; that in this deposition he had not considered 1t advisible to admit hi!! muta with · Achchhi Bibi: that she came to know of this, and by reason of it a dis- agreement took place between them; that as he had made up his mind before this to perform nikah with her, and as it was also necessary to remove the disagreement between them, he had of his own free will and accord psrforme:1 nikah with Achchhi Bibi at a dower of Rs. 50,000, at a general meeting at which 1·aises and respectable residents of the city were present ; hencs he had executed that deed as a memorandum of the dower and nikah that it might be of use in time of need.

If the deed in question be a genuine de9:l, and the _ statements in it be taken aci true, then n )t only was there a nikah marriage between Muhammad Kasim and Achchhi Bibi at or about the time of its execu- tion, but their cohabitation originated in a muta marriage.

After careful consideration of all the evidence their Lordships have come to a conclusion that they ought not to reverse the findings of the High Court as to the genuineness of the deed of dower or the credi- bility of the witnesses who deposed to the celebration of the nikah, The judges who were parties to these findings have necessarily a large ex- perience in matters of this nature. The Subordinate Judge had no more opportunity than they had of seeing and observing the demeanour of the witnesses, and they on the other hand had evidence before them which was not before the Subordinate Judge. No doubt, as pointed out by the learned 06unsel for the appellants, there are good reasons why both the deed itself and the evidence of the witnesses in question ought to be looked upon with suspicion and scrutinised with great care. Their Lord - ships do not think it necessary to go into these reasons. It is enough to say that, after scrutinising the evidence with the greatest care, they do not see their way to disturb the findings of the Court below. There is, however, one matter which does not appear to have been considered by the High Court with the attention which it deserved, and that is the question of the mitta marriage. If the deed be treated as a good and valid deed, and the plaintiff's witnesses as reliable witnesses, there is considerable evidence that the cohabitation of Muhammad Ka- sim and Achchhi Bibi commenced in a muta marriage, and if this be so, in default of evidence to the contrary, such marriage must be taken to have subsisted throughout the period which covered the conception and birth of the plaintiff's two sisters. These sisters would thus be co· heirs with the plaintiff of their father's property. It is true that their claim as such is :statute barred, but the expiration of the period of limi- tation would accrue for the benefit of the defendants in the action (the now appellants), and not for the benefit of the plaintiff (the now respond- ent). In their Lordships' opinion\"the proper conclusion on the assumption that the nikah marriage took place as alleged, was in favour of a muta mardage having also taken place, and of the legitimacy of the plaintiff's sisters, in which case the plaintiff :was entitled to one-third only of what she has recovered under the order of the High Court. In their Lordships' opinion the case should be remitted to the High Court to be dealt with on this footing ; the order must be varied in this respect, with liberty to either party to apply to the High Court to vary the order as . to costs ; and there should be no costs of this appeal which has in pa.rt succeeded and in part failed. And they will humbly advise His Majesty Mcordingly. Appeal partly allowed.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
