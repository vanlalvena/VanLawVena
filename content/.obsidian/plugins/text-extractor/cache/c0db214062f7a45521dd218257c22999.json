KAILASAM, JJ.] STATE OF KARNATAKA Plaintiff; Versus UNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER Defendants. •original Suit No. 8 of 1977, decided on November 8, 1977 Fa&ts On 23rd May, I 977, the Central Government appointed a Commission of Inquiry against the Chief Minister of Karnataka setting therein the terms of reference to the Commission. The plaintiff State of Karnataka filed a suit in the Supreme Court of India for a declaration that the appointment of the Commission was illegal and ultra vires on the groUAds (I) that the Com- mission of Inquiry Act, 1952 does not authorise the Central Government to constitute such a Commission in regard to matters falling exclusively within the sphere of the State's legi1dative and executive power; and (2) that if the provisions of the Act do so empower, they are ultra vires for the contravention of the terms of the Constitution as well as the federal structure implicit and accepted as an inviolable basic feature of the Constitution. The plaintiff also contended that since the State Government had also appointed its own Commission, Section 3(I)(b) of the Act prohibits the Central Government from appointing another Commission to \"enquire into the same matter\" as long as the Commission appointed by the State Government is functioning. The defendant Union of India contended inter alia that since the enquiry against the Chief Minister and certain other Ministers is as individuals and not against the State of Karnataka, the suit was maintainable.

J. 609 The Uoion of India acting through the Central Government can be aaid to represent the whole of the people of India. The individual States, acting through their Governments and Ministers could be said to represent the people of each individual State and their interests. When differences arise between the representatives of the State and those of the whole people of India on questions of interpretation of the Constitution which must affect the welfare of the whole people and particularly that of the people of the State concerned, it would be too technical an argument that a suit does not lie in such cases under Article 13 l. In the present case, there is a Iis. It would be immaterial as regards the dairns on behalf of either the State or its Government whether the two are distinct juristic entities. Even if they could be, the claim of the Government would be that of the State. (Paras 143 and 144) Observations of Beg, C.J. in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India, (1977) 3 SCC 952, explained. Article 131 is a remnant of ' federalism and should be widely and generously interpreted so as to advance the intended remedy. It can be invoked whenever a State and other States or the Union differ on a question of interpretation of the Constitution so that a decision of it will affect the scope or exercise of governmental powers which are attributes of a State. It makes no difference to the maintainability of the action if the powers of the State are exercised through particular individuals as they necessarily must be. But if any of the organs of the State claims exclusive powers to take cognisance of it, the State, as such, becomes interf'sted in a dispute about the legal competence or extent of powers of one of its organs which . may emerge. The fact that the State acts through its Ministers or officials does not affect the maintainability of the suit. There is nothing in the article itself to debar the State which must always necessarily act through its officials or agents or Ministers suing the Centre not only to protect the officer& or Ministers from being proceeded against in any way by the Central Government but prefer its own claim to exclusive power to deal with him and this is what the plaintiff has done by means of the suit in the present case.

Even taking a strictly legalistic view of the matter the preliminary objection of the defendant to the maintainability of the suit ought to be rejected. (Para 161) The jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by Article I 31 of the Constitution should not be t~sted on the anvil of banal rules which are applied under the CPC for determining whether a suit is maintainable. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd. ~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 610 SUPREME COURT CASES (1977) 4 sec I-Constitution of India, Art. 131 (contd.) The article confers original jurisdiction on the Supreme Court and the commonest form of a legal proceeding which is tried by a court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction is a suit. But a constitutional provision, which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to entertain disputes of a certain nature jn the exercise of its original jurisdiction, cannot be equated with the provision conferring a right on a civil court to entertain common suits so as to apply to an original proceeding under the article the canons of a suit which is ordinarily triable under Section 15, CPC by a court of the lowest grade competent to try it. By the very terms of the article the sole condition which is required to be satisfied for invoking the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is that the dispute between the parties referred to in clauses (a) to (c) must involve a question on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. The quintessence of the articie is that there has to be a dispute between the parties regarding a question on which the existence or the extent of a legal right depends. A challengP hy the State Government to the authority of the Central Govern- ment to appoint a Commission of Inquiry clearly involves a question on which the existence or extent of the lf'gal right of the Central Government to appoint a Commission depends and that is enough to sustain the pro- ceeding brought by the State. The Constitution has purposefully conferred on the Supreme Court a jurisdiction which is untrammelled by considerations which fetter the jurisdiction of a court of first instance. The very nature of the disputes arising under the article is different both in form and subs- tance from the nature of claims which require adjudication in ordinary suits. (Paras 162 & 163) The Constitution aims at maintaining a fine balance not only betvO,' en the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, but also between the powers of the Central Government and the State Governments as is shown by the Legislative Lists and the executive power of the Central Government and the State Governments in part XI of the Constitution. This is a delicate relationship particularly if different political parties are in power in the Centre and in the States. The object of the article is to provide a high powered machinery for ensuring that the Central and State Governments act within the respective spheres of their authority and do not trespass upon each other's constitutional functions or powers. Therefore, a challenge to the constitutional capacity of the defendant to act in an intended manner is enough to attract the application of the article, particularly when the plaintiff claims that right exclusively for itself. The proceeding cannot be thrown ont on the ground that the impugned order is not calculated to affect or impair a legal right of the plaintiff. (Para 164) A proceeding under Article 131 stands m sharp contrast with an ordinary suit. The proceedings are adjudicatory of the limits of consti- tutional power vested in the Central and State Governments. The competi- tion in such a proceeding is between two or more Governments either the one or the other of which possesses the constitutional power to act . There is no third alternative as in a civil suit the right claimed by the plaintiff may reside neither in him nor in the defendant but in a stranger. In a proceeding under Article 131, denial of the defendant's right carries with it an assertion of the plaintiff's.

UNION OP INDIA 611 I-Constitution of India, Art. 131 (contd.) power to appoint the Commission but that such a right is exclusively in the State Government. (Paras 165 and 166) State of Rajasthan v. Union of India, (1977) 3 SCC 592,followed. The palliative of a writ petition under Article 226 which is suggested on behalf of the Union Government in such matters is hardly any substitute for a proceeding wider Article 131. Article 131 contemplates varioua permutations and combinations in the matter of array of parties such as the dispute between one or more States or between the Government of India and a State or the Government of India and a State on the one hand and another State or States on the other and such a dispute cannot be decided by a High Court under Article 226. Disputes of the nature described in Article 131 are generally of an urgent nature and their decision can brook no delay. It is, therefore, expedient in the interests of justice that they should as far as possible be brought before and decided by the Supreme Court so as to obviate dilatoriness and a possible appeal. (Paras 167 and 168) Per Bhagwati, J. Artie!& 131 confers on the Supreme Court excluaive oi:iginal jurisdiction in any dispute (a) between the Government of India and one or more States, or (b) between the Government of India and any State or States on the one side and one or more other States on the other, or (c) between two or more States, if and in so far as the dispute involves any question on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. It does not lay down any particular mode of proceeding for exercise of the original jurisdiction conferred by it. Part III of the Supreme Court Rules contemplates that the jurisdiction under this article shall be invoked by means of a suit but this is not the requirement of the article and in interpreting it one should not be influenced by considerations of cause of action which are germane in a suit. There are two limitations in regard to a dispute under the article. One is in regard to the parties and the other in regard to the subject-matter. The object of the article is that since in a federal or a quasi-federal structure which the Indian Constitution sets up, disputes may arise between the Government of India and one or morE! States or between two or more States and a forum should be provided for the resolution of such disputes and that the forum should be the highest court so that final adjudication could be achieved expeditiously. The other limitation as to the subject-matter flows from the word£ \"if and in so far as the dispute involves any question on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends\". While mere wrangles between the Governments have no place under the scheme, when legal as distinct from a mere political issue arises touching upon the existence or extent of the legal right the article is attracted. It is true there is a distinction between \"State\" and \"State Government\"; but when any right or capacity or lack of it is attributed to any institution or person acting on behalf of the State, it raises a matter in which the State is involved or concerned. The State would be affected or at any rate interested if its Chief Minister or other Ministers in their capacity as such, are subjected to any unconstitutional exercise of power by the Central Government. If the Central Government were to issue a direction to the Chief Minister or other Ministers to exercise the executive power of the State in a particular manner, the State would be clearly affected and the position is not different if the Central Government instead proceeds to enquire how the executive power of the State is exercised by the Chief Minister and other Ministers ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In such a case the State could have the locus standi to challenge the action of the Central Government if it is unconstitutional. (Paras 200, 201 and 203) State of Rajasthan v. Union of India, (1977) 3 SCC 592, considered. Poindexter v. Greenlww, 29 L Ed 185, relied on. It is not necessary that the plaintiff should have some legal right of its own to enforce before the suit is instituted under Article 131. What the article requires is that the dispute must be one which involves a question \"on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends\". The article cannot be construed to confine it to cases which relate to the existence or extent of the legal right of the plaintiff, for, to do so would be to read words in the article which are not there. There is no reference to a suit or cause of action in the article. The article confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court with reference to the character of the dispute which may be brought before it for adjudication. The plaintiff must of course be a party to the dispute which is only possible if he is affected by it ( even though no legal right of his is infringed). (Para 204) State of Rajasthan v. Union of India, (1977) 3 SCC 592, referred to (The learned Judges' own observations in that case explained). The word \"right\"· in the article is used in a generic sense. For example, if the State claims to be entitled to legislate exclusively on a particular matter on the ground that it falls within List II of the Seventh Schedule and the Union of India questions this right the dispute is one relating not to any right of the State in the strict sense of the term but to the liberty of the State to legislate on such a matter and it would come directly w.i.thin the terms of the article. A dispute relating to the power of the Union to abolish the legislative assembly of a State or to dissolve it has been held to come within the ambit of the article in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India by· Beg, C. J., Chandrachud and Gupta, JJ. and my- self. (Para 205) It may not be possible to say that by reason of the impugned action of the Central Government in setting up a Commission of Inquiry any legal right of the State is infringed but it is not necessary in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under the article that the State should be able to show that some legal right of its own is breached. It is enough to show that the State is interested not as a busy body or as a meddlesome interloper, but in a real sense in questioning the power of the Central Government to set up the Commission. In the present case, according to the claim made by the State the Legislature of the State and the State Government alone have power to investigate and control the misuse of governmental power by its Ministers and the Central Government has no power to enquire into it or set up a Commission of Inquiry for that purpose. Such a claim raises a dispute as to the extent of the power of the State and concerns the content of the respective powers of the State and Union and the inter•se relationship between the two entities and the State is vitally interested in it. If the State has sufficient title to challenge the validity of the Union legislation on the ground that it interferes with the exercise of State legislative power, it must follow a fortiori that the State would have locus Jtandi to challenge the unconstitutional exercise of power ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Therefore, the suit filed by the State against the Union must be held to be maintainable under the article. (Para 206) Attorney General for Victoria v. Tiu Commonwealth, 71 CLR 237 and Attorney Gmeral for Vi&toria v. TJu Commonwealth 52 CLR 533 relied on. Per Kaila•am., J. The executive power of the State is co-extensive with the legislative power of the State. The executive power of the State will be exercised by the Governor with the aid and advice of his Ministers. According to the impugned notification the Commission is appointed for the purpose of making an enquiry into a definite matter of public importance, namely, charges of corruption etc., against the Chief Minister and certain other matters of the State. The enquiry, therefore, is amongst other things regarding the misuse of governmental power and the scope of the enquiry would inevitably involve the functioning of the executive of tpe State. The plea of the State Govern- ment is that its powers are derived from the Constitution and its existence and exercise of powers as executive of the State is guaranteed by the Constitution and the Centre cannot interfere with such exercise of executive functions. When the exercise of the executive functions of the State through its officers is interfered with by the Central Government it cannot be said that the legal right of the State is not affected. {Para 278) Slate of Rajasthan v. Union of India, (1977) 3 SCC 592, referred to. Per Uatwalia, Sbiaghal and Ja•want Singh, JJ. (dissenting) The suit is not maintainable. (Para 208) The concept of State is that by itself it is an ideal person or a legal entity. In relation to the existence of a dispute between Union of India on the one hand and one or more States on the other, the expression used in Article 131 for the former is the Government of India signifying that the dis- pute may be with the Government of India but i:he other party to the dis- pute must be the State only and not any limb of the State such as the Govern- ment, the Legislature or the Judiciary of the State. If there is an invasion of the legal right of the State, the .agency through which the action will be commenced may well be the Government of the State but the right must be of the State. (Para 212) To invoke jurisdiction under the article (a) the dispute must be bet- ween the Government of India and one or more States or between the two or more States; and (b) the dispute must involve any question on which the existence or extent of the legal right depends. In specific terms it has not been stated as to whose legal right the question involved in the dispute must relate to and in what respect. Ordinarily, in any suit the competition is between the plaintiff and the defendant and the plaintiff has to establish his legal right in order to succeed. As against the claim of the plaintiff if the legal right to the defendant is established he is bound to fail. But on failure of either to establish his own legal right the suit will still fail because the plaintiff cannot succeed unless he establishes his legal right. The expression \"existence or extent of a legal right\" used in the article is meant to bring about this result.

(Para 213) Observations of Chandrachud, J. in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India, (1977) 3 SCC 592, 639, dissentedfrom. In the present case, the Commission of Inquiry set up by the Central Governmen: 1s not against the State or the State Government. It is against the Chi~f Minister and other Ministers who are officers of the State. It may be open to them to take the plea in an appropriate proceeding such as a writ petition under Article 226 but the State is in no way entitled to inyoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under the Article. The argu- ment that the State alone has the right to order an enquiry against its Ministers, that the Centr_al Government has no such right, that the Central Government by setting up the Commission has put an impediment on the right of the State Government to modify or issue any subsequent notification for the purpose of enlarging or clarifying the scope of the enquiry and that therefore the legal right of the State is affected, is without substance. Unless the power exercised by one authority brings about a dispute impinging upon the right of the other authority, the latter cannot come under the article and say that merely because it was within its power to do so its legal right is affected by the illegal exercise of the power by the other authority. The said exercise of the power must directly or by necessary implication affect its legal right. If a restricted meaning were not given to the scope of the suit which can be filed under the article anamolous and absurd results may follow, such as any action taken by the Central Government either under the Act or otherwise against any citizen residing in the State or an officer of the State could be challenged by the institution of a suit under the article by the State on the ground that the action of the Central Government is ultra-vires and without any legal right.

All that the State noti- fication empowers its Commission to enquire Into is whether any excessive payment or irregularity was involved. The emphasis is on the· question of observance or non-observance of rules coupled with the question whether certain payments were proper. The question of affixation of responsibility is confined to lapses in the course of those transactions only. But the Central Government notification is meant to enable the Commission appointed to tear down even the veil of apparent legality and regularity which may be worn by some transactions. The object is not only to affix responsibility on individuals who may be really guilty even if a few of them could be said to have been mentioned in the other notification. Such notifications could not justly or fairly be spoken as covering \"the same matter\". It is left to the Central Commission to determine whenever it is .faced with an objection whether a particular matter has already been properly enquired into by the State Commission. A.s the two notifications authorise enquiries into matters which are substantially different in nature and object, the enquiry by the Central Commission cannot be said to be barred by reason of the appointment of the State Commission. If the objectives are different, the examination of common areas of fact and law for different purposes will still be permissible. (Paras 17, 18, 20, 23 and 24) Per Chandrachud, J. Considering the terms of the notifications issued by the State Govern- ment and the Central Government and the matters into which the respective Commissions are directed to enquire, it is obvious that the object and pur- pose of the two enquiries are basically of a different character._ The enqui- ries highlight the difference and show that they are directed to different ends. The primary object of the State Government in appointing its Commission is to ascertain whether improper or excessive payments were made, undue favours were shown, irregularities or fraud had occurred in the conduct of official business etc., whereas the Commission appointed by the Central Government is specifically directed to enquire \"whether the Chief Minister practised favourtism and nepotism in regard to various matters mentioned in the notification. (Para 170) It must also be recognised that it would hardly ever be possible except in Utopian conditions that the State Government will appoint a Com- mission to enquire into acts of corruption, favouritism and nepotism on the part of its Chief Minister though such a situation is theoretically possible. Thus the objection of the State Government that the notification of the Central Government offends against clause (b) of the proviso to Section 3(1) of the Act is factually unfounded and theoretically unsound. {Para 171) The contention that Section 3( I) of the Act shoulc. not be construed as authorising the Central Government to appoint a Commission for the pur- pose of enquiring into the conduct of a sitting Minister and of a State is baseless.

'Ihe ~ub-sution tmpowers the CentYal GoveYnment to appoint a Ccmmissicn fer making an iriqui1y into any ddinite matter of pub- lic importance and the conduct of the Ministers of State Government in the purported discharge of their cfficial functions is certainly a definite matter of public importance. There is no substance in the contention that the Central Governm~t does riot even possess the power to collect facts in regard to allegations of corruption made by a section of the State Legislature. That power must undoubt€dly be exercised sparingly and with re!.traint because under the guise of directing an inquiry under the sub-section the Central Government cannot interfere with the day-to-day working of the Sta14!

On this view the c-ontention that Section 3(1) should be read fiown and the impugn€d notification should be set aside as falling out- side t~e scope of that section has to be rejected. (Paras 173, 173A and 174) Per Untwalia, Shinghal and Jaswant Singh, JJ. There is no substance in the contention that the Commissions set up by the State and by the Central Government are to enquire into the same matters. The notification of the State Government has not in terms appoint- ed any Commission for enquiry into matters of alleged corruption, nepotism etc., of the Chief Minister or any other Minister of the plaintiff-State. The items mentioned in the State notification are said to be irregularities com- mitted or excess payments made in certain matters relating to contracts etc., and in none of these clauses is mentioned as to who is said to be responsible for the alleged irregularities or mal-administration. By the terms of reference in the notification issued by the Central Government specific matters relating to acts of nepotism etc., of the Ministers of the State are to be enquired into. If some common,matters are found then the notification issued by the Central Government itself excludes such a matter from the jurisdiction of the Com- mission appointed by it. (Para 242) Per Kailasam, J. (dissenting) The Act has enacted provmons for the purpose of avoiding any conflict by the two Governments appointing two separate Commissions to enquire into the same matter. The very object of these provisions would be defeated by the construction sought to be put upon them by the Union Government. The objection to the appointment of the Commission by the Union Government when there is already a Commission appointed by the State is sought to be got over by the Union on the plea that by the impugned notification the enquiry is not directed against the same matters for which the State has appointed a Commission of Inquiry. As the purpose of the two Provisos to Section 3(1) is to avoid conflict, the words \"same matter\" in the Provisos should be given a wide interpretation and only matters that are not referable to the subject-matter of the enquiry by the Commission appointed by the State can be taken over by the Centre. By giving wide meaning to the words ''the same matter\" the contention of the Central Government that the enquiry into the conduct of the Chief Minister' about the same incidents.will make it a different matter, cannot be accepted. {Para 277) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(Para 64) (ii) Under the emergency powers of the Constitution as it stands at present, the semblance of a federal structure in our Con$titution is completely removed for the duration of the emergency. In State of Rajasthan v. Union ef India, (1977) 3 SCC 592, the Supreme Court has also recognised \"residuary executt'v'e power\" in the Central Government similar to residuary legislative power of Parliament. It could therefore be urged that a consideration of the question whether a State Government or its Chief Minister is or is not carrying out the trust which the constitutional power places in the hands of the State Government and its head so as to determine whether any exercise of extra-ordinary powers under Article 356 is called for or not, is a matter which lies within the powers of the Central Government. If the President deems it necessary to give the State Government or its Chief Minister an opportunity of being heard before an impartial Commission of Inquiry it could certainly not be said that such a mode of exercise of power under Article 356 i:s not wholly covered by the words necessarily implied by this Article. (Paras 36 and 41) (iii) In democratic countries not only modern practice but a statute can provide for enquiries of the kind which are meant to be conducted under the Act. The Act gives a very wide and undefined scope of enquiries the only limit being that they must relate to matters which are to be conducted under the Act should be of definite public importance. Th e Ac~, however, contains no provisions for giving any effect to the findings of the Commission or for enforcing ,my order which could be made by the Commission. The proceedings of the Commission could only result in a report which has to be laid before the Legislature concerned under Section 3(4). The obvious jntention behind the- Act is to enable the machinery of democratic govern- ment to function more efficiently and effectively. It could hardly b t• construed as an Act meant to thwart democratic mf'thods. (Paras 30 and 33 ~ (iv) The duality or duplication of organs of Government at the Central and State levels doe's not reflect a truly federal demarcation of powers based on any separatist sPntiments which could threaten the sovereignty and integrity of the Indian Republic to which members of our Constituent Assembly deemed ardently devoted because central supervision is implied. All G nvernors although undertaking to devote themselves to the service and wellbt' ing of the peoplP of their respective States owe an undivided allegiance to the Constitution and the law. Each of them is appointed by th e President and holds office during the pleasure of the President to whom h e sends his reports with a view to any proposed action under Article 356.

That is, it must be related to the provisions of the Constitution and the manner in which they can indubitably be presumed to naturally and reasonably function. The one principle which is deducible in all the applications of basic structure doctrine is that whatever is put forward as a basic limitation upon legislative power must be correlated to one or more of the express pr;visions of the Constitution from which the limitation should naturally and necessarily springforth. The doctrine of basic structure requires that any limitation on legislative power must be so definitely discernible in the Constitution itself that there can be no doubt or mistake that the prohibition is a part of the basic structure imposing a limit on even the power of constitutional amend- ment. (Paras 111 to 120) No doubt, as a set of inferences from a document (i.e. the Constitution), the doctrine of \"the basic structure\" arose out of and relates to the Consti- tution only and does not, in that sense, appertain to the sphere of ordinary statutes or arise for application to them in the same way. But. if, as a result of the doctrine, certain imperatives are inherent in or logically and neces- sarily flow from the Constitution's \"basic structure\", just as though they are its express m~ndates, they can be and have to be used to test the validity of ordinary laws just as other parts of the Constitution are so used. (Para 125) Cases show that whenever the doctrine has been expanded or applied it is only as a doctrine of interpretation of the Constitution as it actually exists and not of a Constitution which could exist only subj~ctively in the minds of different individuals as mere theories about what the Consti1ution is. It was in fact, used by all the Judges for only this purpose with differing results simply because their assessments are inferences as what was part of the basic structure in our Constitution differed. If this be the correct view, the so- called federalism as a fetter on legislative power must find expression in some express provision to be recognised by courts. If the theory of necessary implications is to be applied h~re the eQ.trenched provisions of our Constitu- tion, for which a special procedure for amendment is prescribed within Arti- cle 368 itself, together with other provisions, give the exprC'ss limits to which the operation of the federal principle is confined in the Constitution. None of the expressly mentioned fealures could by any necessary implication im- pinge upon the expressly given and distributed lC'gislative powers. If the .scheme of distribution of lc·gislative powers is basic and express, with its own express limitations implied or unspecified alleged limitations going b<.>yond that scheme are eliminated by the very force of the express provisions.

(vi) The collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the State Legislature cannot be equated to an inquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry . Act~ Collective responsibility does not abridge or truncate the power of the Central Government to appoint a Commission under the Act. Collective responsibility is basically political in origin and mode of operation. It may arise even in cases which may not call for an enquiry under the Act and all matti:rs investigated under the Act may have no bearing on any collective resporuibility. The enquiry under Section 3 of the Act has been ordered by the Cc-ntral Government so as to determine who is actually responsiblt' for certain actions and what could be the motive behind them. The sphere of this enquiry is very different from that in which the collective responsibility functions. The power under Article 164(2) of the Constitution which imposes collective rt>sponsibility on the Ministers as a body is not to find out facts or to establish the actual responsibility of the Chief Minister or any other Minister or Ministers for particular decisions ur governmental acts. That can be more suitably done, when wrongful acts or decisions are complained. of, by means of inquiries under the Act. The proceclure of Parliamentary Committees and the power of such Committees to enquire into legally and ethically wrong acts of Ministers was found to be unsatis- factory and unsound. The principle of individual as well as collective ministerial responsibility can work most efficiently only when cases requiring proper sifting and evaluation of evidence and discussion of questions involved have taken place in pro(·eedings before a Commission appointed nndPr the Act. The whole question of collective responsibility !)r individual responsibility of a Minister is related to the continuance of a Minister or Ministers in office. The only sanction for its enforcement is the pressure of public opinion particularly in terms of withdrawal of political support bv members of Parliament or the State Legislature as the case may be. Th~, appointment of thf' Commission <Jf Inquiry to investigate a matter which should in the ordinary course have gone to a court of law is generally a confession of want of sufficient evidence to take it to court combined with an att!'mpt to satisfy the public need and deaire to discover what had really gone wrong and how and where if possible. The Commission of Inquiry has therefore a function of its own to fulfil. It has an orbit of action of its own within which it can move so as not to conflict with or impede other forms of action and modes of redress. Therefore, the provisions of either Article 75(2) or Article 164(2) could not operate as bars against the imtitution of f' nquiries hy Commissions set up under the Act. (Paras 45 to 4 7, 50, 53 and 54) (vii) Article 194(3) of the Constitution also does not operate to prohibit the appointment of Commissions under the Act. Article 105 and 194 far from dealing with the legislative powers of the Houses of Parliament or of State Legislatures respectively are confined in scope to such powers of each house as it may exercise separately functioning as a House. It also covers the immunities and privileges of each House as a House as well as its Members. Interpreted on the principle of 'noscitur a sociis' the word \"powera\" takes its meaning and colour not only from its context but also from the other words used in association with it. A House of Parliament or a State Legislature cannot try any one or any case directly, as a court of justice can, but it can procee~ quasi~judic~ally .any c~~ of contei:npt o~ ~ts authority and take up motions concernmg its privileges and 1mmun1t1es because in doing so, it only seeks removal of obstruction to the due per- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

If any question of jurisdiction arise• as to whether a matter falls for decision by lfgialature or not it has to be decided by the ordinary courts in appropriate proceedings. For example, the juris- dictioR to try a criminal offente such as murder committed even within a House vests in the criminal courts and not in the Houae of the Legislature. It could not therefore be contended by the plaintiff that the Ministers answerable to a legislature are governed by a separate law which exempts them from liabilities under the ordinary law. (Paras 55, 56 and 6S) Indira .Nehru Gandhi v. Raj .Narain, (1975) Supp SCC 1, relied on (viii) Article 248 of the Constitution vests in Parliament exclusive power to legislate with respect to matters not enumerated in either the Concurrent or State List. This power is a residuary power vesting in Parliament. In addition, Parliament has overriding powers of legislating even for matten in the State list for limited durations if the Council of States by resolution supported by not les1 than two-thirds of its members declare that it is necessary to do so in national intere1t or during the continuance of a procla- mation of emergency. Inconsistency between the laws made by the Parlia- ment and a State Legislature on an item found in the Concurrent List i1 to be resolved in favour of the law made by Parliament. (Para 36) (ix) The question whether the Act could be pass<'d by Parliament must be determined exclusively by the provisions of Chapter 1 of Part XI (Articles 245-255) which refers to the Legislative Lists in the Seventh Schedule because the question is really one of legislative powers and not administrative relations or directions. Unless such an Act has the effect of being in excess of ordinary legislative power it cannot be so deemed when it merely supplements and facilitates due discharge of constitutional powers. The Indian Constitution is lengthy and comprehensive. Nevertheless, to expect its contents to be so all-embracing as to necessarily specify and deal with every conceivable topic of legislation on all constitutional matters exhaus- tively so as to leave no room for doubt is to expect the humanly impracticable if not the impossible. To build up an argument on the supposed reasonable- ness of such an expectation and some loosely drafted comprehensive definition of either 'Constitutional Law' or a 'Constitution• that what is not so specified and identifiable as a !lubject of legislation must be necesaarily prohibited i1 very unrealistic. In the present case, Entry 94 of List I provides for enquiries with respect of any of the matters in that List. I tern 97 corres- ponds to the residuary legislative powers of Parliament under Article 248 and provides for any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those Liata. R.e1ort to Article 248 read with Item 97 of List I could not overcome any specific constitutional bar against legislation on investigation into the conduct of State Min4ten in the discharge of their duties. There is certainly no such express and 1pecific bar in the Constitution. It is, therefore, difficult to 1ee how one can arise by some nece.iSary implication of provisions dealing with entirely different topics. There seems to be no legal or rational nexus between such a supposed bar or limitation and th~ subjects dealt with in the Article&. Alternatively Entry 45 of the Concurrent Li~t provides for enquiries for the purpose of any of the matters specified in List II or List Ill.

A Minister would thus become a legally irresponsible despot above the ordinary law. Such a consequence of the constitutional provision could not be within the contemplation of our Constitution makers. Such a view would probably be violative of Article 14. (Paru 65, 66, 71, 73 to 76) M,Culloeh v. Ma,yland, 4 Wheat 316 (1819), 11li,d on (.--) The term \"inquiries\" used in Item 94 of List I and Item 45 of List Ill, without any limitations upon their nature or specification of their character or objects, is wide enough to embrace every kind of enquiry. \"Any of the matters specified\" is broad enough to cover anything reasonably related to any of the enumerated items even if done by holders of ministerial offices in the States. Even assuming that neither of these two Entries could cover enquiries against Ministers in the States, Article 248 read with Entry 97 must necessarily cover an enquiry against Ministers on matters of public importance. A contrary view ·would have the wholly unacceptable conse- quence of placing the Ministers of State Government above the law. The fact that reckless charges may perhaps be made is not a ground for doing away with enquiries under the Act because facing such an enquiry is one of the hazards of holding ministerial office and after all the enquiry is held through impartial and competent persons who have held high judicial office.

(1937) 56 CLR 65 7, 682, relied on (xi) As the powers conferred by Section 3 upon the Central and State Governments including the power to institute enquiries of the kind set up under each of the two notifications are covered by express constitutional provisions, no question of any exclusion either by necessary implication or any other principle arises. Exp,essio Unius &, Exdusio Alterius is miscon- ceived. Constitution makers intended to cover the making of provisions by Parliament for enquiries for various objects which may be matters of public importance without any indications of any other limits except that they must relate to subjects found in the Lists. Thus there is express provision to cover the enactment of Section 3 and there is no room whatsoever for applying the maxim. (Para 79 and 80) Colqulwun v. Brooks, (1888) 21 QBD 52, r,lied on (.--ii) The argument that what i.s not .!pecifically mentioned must be deemed to be deliberately excluded so that nothing short of a Constitution amendment could authorise legislation upon it is really to invent a casus omissu.s when there is no such gap in the law. The court cannot so interpret a statute as to produce a casus omissus.

(i) It is not possible to accept the contention that if the language of Section 3(1) is construed widely it will not only enable the Central Govern- ment to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to enquire into the conduct of State Ministers but will also enable the State Governments to appoint similar Commiasions to enquire into the conduct of Central Ministers and that such a situation would offend against the provisions of Articles 75(3) and 164(2) of the Constitution. Neither the appointment of thf' Commission nor even the rejection by the Commission of all or any of the allegations referred to it for its enquiry would make the Council of Ministers any the less responsi- ble to the respective legislatures. Because acts of corruption, nepotism or favouritism are alleged or proved against an individual Minister, it cannot be held that the entire Council of Ministers would be collectively responsible to the Legislature. If an individual Minister uses his office as an occasion or pretence for committing acts of corruption, he would be personally answer- able for his unlawful acts and no question of collective responsibility of Council of Ministers can arise in such a case.

Stat, of Madras, (1970) 3 SOR 505: (1970) l SCC 443, 449, followed (ii) It is also impossible to hold that the appointment of Commission of Inquiry constitutes an interference with the privilege of the Legislature under Article 194(3). (Para 180) (iii) India undoubtedly i1 a Union of States which can be described as a federal or quasi-federal constitution. The balance of power between the Central and the State Governments ought never to be disturbed but that is a different thing from saying that inherent and implied limitations should be read into legislative powers or that because India is a Union of States, one must read into the Constitution powers and provisions which are not to be found therein but which may seem to follow logically from what the Constitution provides for expressly. Parliament has certainly legislative competence to enact the Act. It u; well established that entrieli in the Legislative Lists must receive not a narrow or pedantic but a wide and liberal construction and, considered from that point of view, the word \"enquiries\" which occurs in Entry 94 of List I and Entry 45 of List III must be held to cover the power to pass an Act providing for appointment of Commitsions of Inquiry. Since the power to appoint a Commission to enquire into the conduct of sitting Ministers of State Governments which is comprehended within Section 3 ( l) of the Act does not offend against the principle of collective responsibility of the State's Council of Ministers or against the privileges of the State Legislative Assembly and since it does not also confer on the Central Government the power to control the State executive, the provision must be held to be a valid exercise of the legislative competence of Parliament. (Paras 189 and 190) Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justic, S. R. Tendolkar, 1959 SCR 279, follow,d (iv) Even if the Entries 94 of List I and 45 of List III do not justify the passing of the Act the residuary Entry 97 of List I will in any event support the legislative validity of the Act. (Paras 191 and 192) (v) The contention based on the assumption that the central executive cannot, save by constitutional amendment, be given power to control the functions of the State executive thtough the medium of a Commission of Inquiry is without substance, because the impugned legislation has not conferred on the Central Government any power tq control the executive functions of the State Government. It is clear fro:r_n the provisions and the general scheme of the Act that the Commission is appointed as a purely fact finding body which has no power to pronounce a binding or definitive judgment. It has to collect facts through the evidence led before it and on a consideration thereof it is required to submit iti report which the appoinling authority may or may not accept. These are sensitive matters of public importance and should not be left to the normal investigational agency such as the Police. The police investigation is a unilateral enquiry into an accusation since the person whose conduct is the subject-matter of enquiry has no right or opportunity to cross-examine the witness whose statements ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On tJ:ie other hand, under the Act there is a right of cross-examination, right of audience and right of representation through a legal practitioner. It is undeniable that the person whose conduct is being enquired into and if he be a Chief Miµis\"ter or a Minister the doings of the Government itself are exposed to the fierce light of publicity. But that is a risk which is inherent in every enquiry directed at finding out the truth. It does not however justify the submission that the enquiry constitutes an interference with the executive functions of the State Government or that it confers on the Central Government the power to control functions of the State Executive. It is in the interests of those against whom open allegatiom of corruption and nepotwn are made that they should have an opportunity of repelling those allegations before a trained and independent Commission which is not hide-bound by the technical rules of evidence. It is only by establishing the truth that the purity and integrity of public life can be preserved. Therefore, the power conferred by Parliament on the Central Government to appoint a Commission under the Act for the purpose of finding facts in regard to allegati9ns of corruption etc., cannot be held to constitute interference with the executive functions of the State Government. The Central Government may or may not take any action depending upon .the nature of the findings recorded by the Commission. (Paras 182 to 186) M. V. Rajwad, v. Dr. S. M.

It is true that administrative relations between the Union and the States are dealt with in Chapter 2 of Part XI and though the provisions contained therein connot be altered save by a constitutional amendment, the A~t does not bring about any change in the Centre-State relationship as envisaged by Part XI. The Act .merely empowers the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of collecting facts with a view to informing its own mind. The revelations before the Commission may conceivably produce an impact on the credibility of the State Gevernment but the enquiry is directed not to the manner in which the State Government or the State executive conducts itself in the discharge of its constitutional functions but the manner in which its Ministers have used their office as a cloak for committing acts of corrup- tion and favouritism. It is possible that the Commission may or may not accept the accusations against the Minister or emphasise that the private doings of the Minister have nothing to do with the public administration of State's executive affairs. Therefore, the contention that by empowering the Central Government to appoint a Commission for enquiring into the conduct of State Ministers, Parliament has legislated on Centre-State relationship is without any force.

Once legislative competence is established and no violation of any specific coni,;titutional provision is made out the validity of th e Act cann ot be assailed on the ground that it supple- ments a comtitutional provision. The fallacy of the State's argument consists in the ~ssumption that every law \" in respect of\" a subject-matter dealt with hy tllt' C onstitution amounts n ece1,sarily an amendment to the Constitution. The Act does not deal with the subject-matter of the Centre- State relafrmship directly or indirectly. There is, therefore, no question of its creating a new rel,,tionship between th e Union and the States not known to the Comtitution or inconsistent with what is provided for in Chapter 2 of Part XI of the Constitution. Therefore, even assuming that legislation on the question of Centre-Stat e relationship is impliedly barred, the impugned Act does not fall within the vice of that r ule and cannot be therefore pronounced as unconstitutional. If a law is within the legislative competence of the Legislature it cannot be invalidated on the supposed ground that it has added som Pthing to or has supplemented a constitutional provision so long as the addition or supplementation is not incon:.istent with any provision of the Constitution. The doctrine of implied prohibition which is necessarily based on thr principlt• of inherent limitations has been rejected by this Court in the Fundamental Rights Case and Indira Gandhi Case.

There is no exercise of any supervisory or disciplinary jurisdiction by the Central Government against the State Government by the appointment of a Commis- sion. The Centre, however, must be and is concerned with and interested in knowing and ascertaining facts as regards the allegations made against any Minister of the State. (Para 230) M. V. Rajwade v.

Commission of Inquiry, (1969) I SOR 387,followed (iii) It is incongruous and highly anamoloua that the State Government would think of instituting an enquiry against itself. Although technically and literally the Ministers are appointed by the Governor and hold office at his pleasure, in reality, the Governor in his discretion cannot by himself set up a Commission of Inquiry against a sitting Minister. Therefore, the power of the Central Government to set up such a Commission is not exclud- ed. After ascertainment of facts, further action may follow or be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution or the law. (Para 231) (iv) The contention based on Article 164(2) that the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State and that therefore a Minister is in no other W§lY responsible, answerable or account- able or cannot be subjected to an enquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry Act is based on a misconception of the true import and meaning of the doctrine of collective responsibility and as such cannot be countenanced. (Paras 232 to 235) State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Bakshi Ghulam M9hammad, 1966 Supp. SOR 401 followed (v) If any article of the Constitution permits the Centre to encroach upon the legislative and executive field of the State then there can be no doubt that the encroachment is legal and valid. Entry 94 in the Union List empowers Parliament to legislate concerning enquiries for the purpose of any matter in that List, that is to say, if any kind of enquiry is necessary for any kind of purpose connected with any of the matters in List I, then Parlia- ment is empowered to make a law for the purpose of providing for the machinery of enquiry for the purposes of any of the matters specified in List II and List III. Empowering the Central Legislature to make a law for the purpose of enquiry in regard to matters specified in List II is in no sense empowering it to legislate vis-a-vis such matters.

If there has been corruption, nt\"potism, favouritism or mal-administration in connection with auy executive action of the State Government, the law made undrr Entry 45 of the Concurrent List can undoubtedly cover an enquiry under the Act by a commissi0n appointed thereunder which is a fact finding body for the purpose of finding the facts. If Parliament is competent to legislate and the Ct>ntral Government is empowered to make an executive order asking the C. B.

The Union Government can supersede the State Governments under Article 365, give directions in certain specified matters under Articles 256 and 257 and during the period of emer- gency, the power of the Union Executiv~ to give directions to the State Governments will extend to any matter and the Legislative power of the Union Government will extend to matters even in the State List. The question that arises for consideration, however, is whether the Union Govern- ment can order an enquiry into the governmental functions of the State which is not specifically conferred on the Union by the Constitution. (Paras 259 and 260) (iii) Reading the Act as a whole, the Commission is given wide powers of enquiry compelling attendance of witnesses and persons who are liable to be prejudicially affected, giving them a right of cross-examination and when a report is submitted by the Commission Section 3(4) contemplates action to be taken by the appropriate Government.

Those pronouncements are only an authority for the proposition that enquiry into the acts of the person who had ceased to be a Chief Minister may continue to be a matter of public importance. Further, if Section 3 of the Act is construed as enabling the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry into the conduct of a State Minister in office it would result in empowering the Central Government which is a delegate of Parliament to exercise powers which would never have been contemplated by the Parliament.

Dhillon, (1972) 2 SOR 33: ( I 97 l) 2 SCC 779, referred lo and explained The observation in Dhillon's case does not decide the question whether the residuary legislative power of the Union includes a right to direct enquiry into the governmental functions of the State. As there is no provision in the Constitution conferring such a power, the reference to the Lists will not solve the problem. (Para 260) (vi) The reliance by the Union Government on Entry 94 in List I and Entry 45 in List III in the Seventh Schedule for power to enact the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 is misconceived. Entry 94 is confined to matters in List I and Entry 45 enables the Union to make laws for enquiries for the purpose of any of the matters specified in Lists II and III. The word \"inquiries\" would not include the power to make enquiry into the misuse of the governmental powers by the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State Government while in office. In the present case, the enquiry into the misconduct in exercising governmental functions cannot be discerned from any of the Entries in List II or List III. If such a power is conceded to the Union, it cannot be denied that the State Government will also have the power to legislate empowering the State to enquire into the misuse of governmental powers by a Union Minister relating to matters in List II and List III. This circumstance is a strong indication that the word \"enquiries\" in Entry 45 of List lll should not be given a wide meaning as conferring a power on the Union and the State Governments, powers to enact a provision to embark on an enquiry as to the misuse of governmental powers by the other. From the proviso to Section 3(1) which bars the State Government from appointing the Commission to enquire into the same matter when already the Central Government has appointed a Commission and vic~-versa it is clear that the section could not have contemplated the appointment by the Central Government of a Commission to enquire into the abuse of the power by the State Government being aware of the fact that auch a construction would enable the State Government to appoint a Commission to enquire into the misuse of the power of the Central Govern- ment in any of the matters relating to List lI & Ill.

This, however, does not mean that courts, acting under the guise of judicial power, can nullify, defeat or distort the reasmaably clear meaning of any part of the Constitution in order to give expression to some theory of their own about the broad or basic scheme of the Constitution. The power of judicial interpretation even if it includes what may be termed as interstitial law-making cannot extend to direct conflict with express provisons of the Constitution or to ruling -them out of existence, as the express provisions cannot be curtailed by importing limits based on a mere theory of limitations on legislative powers.

J.-\"India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.\" The very first mandate of the first article of our Constitution to which we owe allegiance thus prohibits, by necessary implication, according to the plaintiff in the original suit now before us under Article l 3 l of the Constitution of India, any constitutionally unjustifiable trespass by theo Union Government upon the domain of the powers of the States. The State of Karnataka, has, therefore sued, for a declaration that a notification dated May 23, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Central Notification') constituting a Commission of Inquiry in purported exercise of its powers under Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), is illegal and ultra vires. This declaration is sought on one of two alternative grounds: firstly, that the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, does not \"authorise the Central Government to constitute a Commission of Inquiry in regard to matters falling exclusively within the sphere of the State's legislative and executive power\" ; and, secondly, that if the provisions of the Act do cover the Central Government Notification, , they are ultra vires for contravention of \"the terms of the Constitution as well as the federal structure implicit and accepted as an inviolable basic feature of the Constitution\". Consequentially, \"the plaintiff seeks a perpetual injunction to restrain the respondents, the Union of India and Shri A. N. Grover, the one- man Commission of Inquiry into ''charges of corruption, nepotism, favouri- tism and misuse of Governmental power against the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State of Karnataka\", from acting under the Central Government's notification, 2. The plaintiff State's case is: that, the Congress party was returned by the electors by a majority at an election }fold in the State in 1972 ; that, the majority party in the Legislature elected Shri Devraj Urs as its leader who then formed his Government as required by Article 163 of the Constitu- tion; that, the Government thus installed, by what mmt be deemed to be the will and decision of the State Legislature, continues to enjoy the confidence of the Legislature and is in office ; that, in the recent Lok Sabha elections, the Congress party headed by Shri Devraj Urs achieved a resound- ing success by having won 26 out of 28 seats so that theJanata party, which is in power at the Centre, must be deemed to have been rejected by the electorate, but it is indirectly, through the appointment of a Central Commission of Inquiry, trying to discredit the Congress party and its leaders in the State of Karnataka, and, thereby, interfering with the democratic machinery of control and supervision of the Government of the State provided by the Constitution itself. :J. On April 26, 1977, the Union Home Minister sent a letter to the Chief Minister of the State communicating the allegations contained in a Memorandum submitted by certain members of the opposition party in the Karnataka State Legislature and asked him to mak~ his comments. The Chief Minister gave a reply dated May 13, 1977, a copy of which was attached to the plaint. 4. The Chief Minister, in his reply, complains that \"Slanderous propa- ganda has been unleashed without any verification of the truth or otherwise of the allegations or past history of most of the charges\". He points out that broadcasts and Press reports had given him an intimation of the allegations sent to him even before they were received by him with the Home Minister's letter.

The insinuation was that the whole object of manipulated charges against the Chief Minister was to vilify him and his Government and to bring him down in the estimation of the public so as to destroy the support which the Congress party had from the people of the State. It was thus a charge of malice in fact . . 5. The Chief Minister also took shelter behind the federal principles said to be embodied in our Constitution and described them as \"the corner- stone of national unity and national integrity\". He asserted : ''The Consti- tution is the so1trce of all power for the various organs of the Centre and the State and all actions and exercise of all power under any of the statutes either by the Centre or by the State must conform to and be subordinated to the scheme of distribution of powers, legislative and executive, under the federal scheme of the Constitution\". 6. The Chief Minister also admitted, in his letter to the Union Home Minister, that the Constitution \"in certain exceptional circumstances provides for the Centre making inroads into the exclusive domain of the State Legislature or the State executive\". But, he denied that the excep- tional circumstances, expressly provided for in the Constitution, for interference by the Centre, existed in the instant case. 7. Evidently, the Chief Minister meant that there v;as no room for invoking the emergency provisions under Article 356 of the Constitution which provides for the assumption by the President of India of any of the functions of the Government and by the Union Parliament of the functions of the State Legislature, provided \"the President is satisfied on receipt of a report from the Governor of a State or otherwise that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in terms of the Conatitution\". 8. The Chief Minister also invokes the aid of the principles of democracy which, according to him, permeate the whole scheme of the Constitution, so that Chief Ministers and other State Ministers can be called to account only by the State Legislature to which they are responsible. He asserted that \"the Cabinet system of Government is a basic feature of the Indian Constitution\". This implies, according to him, that all control over ministerial actions vests in the State Legislatures only and not in the Union Government, subject, of course, to exceptions expressly provided . With regard to the actions of the State Government, he complained that the assumption of inquisitorial or supervisory functions by the Union Government at the instance of \"an extra-constitutional agency, however high, would destroy the basic character of the Cabinet system of Government and would rob the Legislature of the State and its people, of the constitutionaliy guaranteed right of having a Government of their choice subject to their control\". He claimed that the State had exclusive right to investigate charges relating to matters falling ''within exclusive domain of the State under the Constitution\". He warned against the dangers to national interest by undue interference with the federal scheme contemplated by the Constitu- tion. 9.

He offered to clear himself of these charges. He pointed out that 4 of the charges related to his colleagues and had been discussed in the Legislature. He also said that 3 charges had already been enquired into by the former Prime Minister. He said that he did not want these to be roopened. He cited the speech of Shri Om Mehta, a former Minister of State, in the Lok Sabha, on May 5, 1976, where it was stated that some memoranda had been sent, containing allegations of corruption and misuse of power made against the Chief Minister and other Ministers of Karnataka by some members of the Legislative Assembly, as long ago as 1973. According to that statement, there were 99 allega dons out of which 16 concerned the Chief Minister perso- nally. Shri Mehta was said to have declared that the allegations against the Chief Minister were found to lack substance after the settled procedure of inviting comments from the Chief Minister had been observed. The Chief Minister then dealt at considerable length with the individual charges. 10. In the plaint before us, it .was pointed out that charges of the nature now referred to the one•m\"an Commission by the Central Government had been made over since 1972 elections both on the floor of the Legislature and elsewhere. It also said that they had been explained and answered on the floor of the Legislature repeatedly. The Chief Minister complained that the same allegations had been repeated after a new Government had assumed office at the Centre. . ~1. It ~as also assert~d _in the plaint !hat, ~n OI:der to allay any suspi- cion 1n the minds of the public in the State, and, m view of the continued agitation for a judicial probe, and, in accordance with the highest and best traditions of Government, the State Government, by a notification, dated May 18, 1977, appointed a Commission of Inquiry under Sec~ion 3(1) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. A copy of the notification of the State Government was attached to the complaint. It was all~ed that a copy of it had also been sent to the Home Minister on May 18, 1977. 12. One of the submissions by the plaintiff is that the State Government notification dated May 18, 1977, appointing its own Commission to inquire into all the matters and irregularities, to which additions could be made and of which further particulars could be provided, covers all that could be enquired into by the Grover Commission under the notification dated May 23, 1977, which specifically excludes matters covered by the Karnataka Government's notification dated May 18, 1977. Reliance is placed on proviso (h) to Section 3( 1) of the Act which prohibits the Central Govern- ment from appointing another Commission ''to inquire into the same matter for so long as Commission app~inted br ~he State Government is functioning, unless the Central Government 1s of op1mon that the scope of the inquiry should be extended to two or more Statesn. 13. The written statement filed on behalf of the Union of India raist__M two preliminary objections as follows before replying seriatim to the para- graphs in the plaint. The preliminary objections are: ( 1) The suit by the State of Karnataka is not maintainable inas- much as the impugned notification S.0. 365(E) dated May 23, 1977 constituting the Commission of Inquiry does not affect the plaintiff- State.

The inquiry is against the Chief Minister and certain other Ministers as individuals and not against the State of Karnataka. The inquiry is rather in the interest of State that 1uch corruption, nepotism, favouritism should not exist in the State. The State of Karnataka is not directly interested in the inquiry proposed to be held ,against the Chief Minister and certain other Ministers of the State. The individuals ocq1pying the office of Chief Minister and Ministers are distinct from the State itself. (2) Article 131 of the Constitution of India gives original jurisdiction to the Hon'ble Supreme Court in any dispute between the Government o~ India and one or more States etc., if the dispute involves any question of law or fact on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. There being no dispute between the Government of India and the State , the suit is not maintainable. There is no legal right of the plaintiff-State to nlP the present suit. 14. The Union of India denied that the matters now to be enquired in- to by the Grover Commission constituted a resuscitation of previous charges and allegations which had been disposed of. Male fides in the institution of the Commission of Inquiry is denied. The validity of all provisions of thf' Act is staunchly defended. The inquiry ordered by the Central GovPrnment is, it is asserted, quite compaent and not covered by thr> State Gove~nrnent notification. It is denied that the federal scheme or democ;. atic principles embodied in the Constitution are affected by the institution of a Commission of Inquiry of the kind set up. It is submitted that the Central Government Commission of Inquiry was ordered to enable an appropriate and completely impartial fact finding process to take place so that either the Central Govern- ment or any other authority or ~ven members of the public may, in accor- dance with democratic principles, act in a manner which is constitutionally proper and fully justified. In any case, the conduct of the Chief MinistPr of a State with regard to affairs of State and the manner in which he used hi~ official position were, according to Union Government, matters of public importance into which the Central Government was quite competent to order impartial fact finding inquiries in public interest. 15. On the above set of pleadings, the following issues were framed this Court: by J. 2. Central Act? Is the suit maintainable? Is the impugned notification ultra vires the powers of the Government under Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry 3. If Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act authorises tlw C-entqtl Government to issue the impugned notification, is the section itself unconstitutional? 16. An important preliminary question to be decided, for the r easons already indicated, concerns the nature of the two inquiries, one by the State Government and another instituted by the Central Government. If the two notifications cover substantially \"the same matter\", it may not be necessary to deal with other questions at all. The parties have very fully argued their cases on thi<J question even though no separate or specific issue has been ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

They have argued on the assumption that a decision on it is implied in the trial of other issues in the c;ase. We will, therefore, take it up first separately as a preliminary question which we should decide before taking up other matters in jssue. A determination of this question has an important bearing on matters argued for purposes of deciding each of the three issues framed above. Even if the question was not directly or indirectly involved in the decision of each of the three issues framed above, a decision on it seems necessary for clearing the ground for a correct approach to the whole case. It is certainly not a question we co'uld abstain from deciding simply because no specific issue was framed separately on it at the outsrt. Although, in view of the fact that the question has been put in issue and so understood and very fully argued by the parties, a separate and specific issue need not be framed upon it, yet, because of the crucial importance of it, we formulate it now separately and specifically as follows : Do bo1 h the State and the Central Government inquiries relate to the \"same matter\" within the meaning of proviso ( b) to Section 3 ( 1) of the Act so as to bar an inquiry by the Centra.l or Union Government so long as the State Commission is functioning?

The fiist thing that strikes one, on a bare reading of the two iotifications is that, wheri>as thP State notification seems scrupulously to Lvoid any mention of any particular act or part of any individual whatsoever, he whole objPct of the Central Government notification seems to be to nquire into thP correcln<'sS of the allegations made against the Chief \\.finister of the State principally and into allegations against other !ipecified ndividuals incidentally. The objects and subject-matter of the Central }overnment notification become clear<'r by looking at Annexures 1 and 2 of t giving particulars of transactions to be investigated. The first five items >f Annexure I are !>eparate transactions in each of which the Chief Minister >f the State is himself alleged to have played the principal role in such a way ,s to indicatf' his exclusive responsibility. In other transactions, such as n items 10, 11 and 13, the Chief Minister is shown as having participated vith others. And, in the remaining transactions mentioned, the allegations lo not place the responsibility on any particular individual, but they seem lesigncd to elicit the truth of allegations of favouritism, nepotism, and misuse >f powl'r against whoever may be responsible.

Ltd. fgj(C~® ION LINE;\" True Prinf 638 SUPREME COURT CASES (1977) 4 sec Government notification begins by a statement which shows that its object is to determine whether the Chief Minister or any other Minister of the Government of the State of Karnataka, indulged in nepotism, favouritism, or misuse of governmental powers in a numb& of transactions which are listed as items l to 25 there. On the other hand, the State Government notification, without mentioning the persons who might be responsible for any excessive or improper·payments, or favouritism, or misappropriation, or irregularity, mentions certain contracts in favour of various companies, or parties under 32 heads. It then states, as a separate item of inquiry, the question as to who were the persons responsible in the lapses; if any, mentioned earlier. In other words, apart from their parts in certain lapses the responsibility of the Chief Minister or any other Minister of the Govern- ment of Karnataka could not be inquired into by the Commission appointed under the State notification. And, all that the State notification seems to empower its Commission to enquire into, with regard to transactions mentioned there is whether there was any excessive payment or irregularity involved. Hence, it speaks of responsibility for \"lapses\" as though one could assume that there was no dishonest motive. The emphasis, in the State notification, is on the question of observance or non-observance of rules coupled with the question whether certain paymt-nts were proper. And, the question of affixation of respontibility is confined to \"lapses\" in the course of these transactions only. 18. Even if a transaction has been made completely in accordance with the rules, it may, nevertheless, be an act of favouritism tainted with corrup- tion or dishonesty. Less deserving partit-s could be deliberately preferred over more deserving parties in such transactions. It is not difficult to make out compliance with the rules or to show on paper that the most deserving party has received the benefit of a contract. Indeed, even the most deserving party may receive a contract or a benefit under a decision taken by a Government or its Ministers who may have received an illegal gratification for it without anything whatsoever appearing on the records of the Government about the bribe received by the Minister concerned. Hence, in addition to tht- fact that the items mentioned in the two notifications mostly do not tally with each other, it appears to us that the objects of the State notification do not go beyond investigation into the illegality or irregularity of any transaction and \"responsibility\" only of persons concerned to point out what they were. If one may so put it, the State notification is meant to -Set up a Commission which has to inquire whether the veil worn by certain transactions is correct in form and covers it fully, but the Central Government notification is clearly meant to enable the Commission appointed to tear down even the veil of apparent legality and regularity which may be worn by some transactions. It authorises the Grover Commission to inquire into and discover the reality or substance, if any, behind certain (mostly other) transactions. The object of the Central Government notification seems clearly not only to affix responsibility for transactions mentioned there on individuals who may be really guilty even if a few of them could be said to have been mentioned in both notifications. We do not think that such notifications would justly or fairly be spoken of as covering \"the same matter\", as contemplated by proviso (b) to Section 3(1) of the Act, because the State Commission is there to examine the appearancP or the surface whereas the Central Commission is expected to delve deeper into what could only lie behind or below it . 19.

Ltd. ~(C(C® IONLINEf True Prinf STATE OF KARNATAICA v. UNION OF INDIA (Beg, C.J.) 639 or illegality has been committed in a particular transaction by its Govern- ment or a Minister. But, it would obviously be more helpful to determine why it has been committed. And, it should be still more important for it to find out who, however highiy placed, is really responsible for the commission of that irregularity and whe 1her any dishonesty or corruption has operated at the highest levels in the State even if the form is proper and regular. If the State notification shows no concern for what seem to us to he the much more important objects of the Central Government notification, one could perhaps guess that the indifference of the State towards the more serious matters is not without some object or significance. Nevertheless, we do not propose to pass any judgment on the motives of the Staie Government or the fact that the most important or significant features of what has been alleged against the Chief Minister and members of his Government have been left out by the State Government notification even if the object of that notification was quite bona fide and proper so far as it went . We think, however, that the State notification does not go far enough. But, the Central Government notification does proceed further. It squarely levels charges against persons who, according to the allegations made, may have acted in a manner which makes them not only theoretically responsible but actually guilty of corruption. 20. For the success of the policies of any State or Government in it, in any part of the country over which its authority runs, it should be shown to be capable of carrying out the constitutional mandat 1!s contained in Part IV of the Directive Principles of State Policy ·so as to make the basic human rights guaranteed by our Constitution a reality and not a mirage. That, for the masses of our people, is the basic purpose of the whole Con- stitution which cannot b e allowed to be frustrated. If the basic rights of the people are not to be stultified and to appear chimerical, those in charge of the affairs of the State, at the highest levels, must be above suspicion. Thi~ is only possible if their own bona fides and utterly unquestionable integrit, ~re assured a.nd apparent in the context of the high purposes of our Constitution and the dire needs of our poverty stricken masses. We cannot view allega- tions of corruption lightly. We think that the interests of the States and of the Union ar.e not antithetical when there are charges of corruption and misuse of powt>r against those in authority anywhere . To serve the common interL'Sts of th C' whole peop le , on whose behalf our Constitution speaks, the States and the Union cannot stand apart. They must <;tand together united in purpose and action . It is as important that unjustified and malicious attacks and charges aga inst individuals in high places should be unmasked ,mcl the reality bd1ind th e m 1•xpo:,ed for what it is worth, as it is that justified Lomplaints mu'it tind adr,quate means of redress so that the interests of the dumb millions o f ow countrymen are <luly safeguarded against unscrupulou~- ness wh erever found. If, as we find in this case, the State notification i· meant only to superficially scratch the ~urface of the allegations mad.:, whereas the C C'ntral Government notification is meant to probe into the crux or the heart of what m a y or m a y not have gone wrong with the body politic in the State of Karn a taka. we could not be too technical or astute in finding reasons to hold that th C' subject matter of the two enquiries is substantially tJ, c ~amc. Obviously, this could not really be so. A bare reading of the two notifications, set out in full above, shows that, 21. In the circumstance-s of this case, it may be more graceful for the Chief Minist('r of the State of Karnataka to waive his technical objections, as he seems to do in undertaking to place all the material before whichever ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

He could take the opportunity to honourably face and repel the charges which, according to him, have been repeatedly but unjustifiably and maliciously made against him over a sufficiently long period. He could thus be able to establish that he is serving the interests of his State, its inhabitants, and, indeed, of the country as a whole, if his assertions are correct. 22. The plaintiff has not suggested a-nywhere that the Grover Commis- sion is not presided over by an individual of unquestionable integrity and independence who has been a Judge of this Court. Mr. Lal Narain Sinha, appearing for the plaintiff, has, very frankly and properly, conceded that he cannot successfully presa want of bona fides on the part of the Central Government in issuing its notification. This means that the question whether th~ Commission is either unnecessary, except as a weapon of political warfare, as well as any doubts about whether it could be or was to be misu11ed in this case, must be dismissed as unsustainable. The State Government must itself be deemed to admit that circumstances necessitated the appointment of a Commission, by appointing its own, to inquire into analoious mattus which deserved investigation due to their public importance. 2S. We find that the Central Government notification itself excludes from its purview those charges which may be fairly said to fall within the scope of the Commission set up by the State Government. We are not concerned with matters which may be subsequently added so as to expand the scope of inquiry by the State Commission. We think that the provisions of proviso (b) to Section 3(1) of the Act will prPvent the State Government from adding such mattns as are already covered by the Central Government notification. We, however, leave it to the Grover Commission itself to determine, whenever it is faced with such an objection, whether a particular matter is already being properly enquired into by the State Commission. 24:. In view of what we~ have obsPrved above, it would perhaps be proper for the Government of Kai nataka itself to withdraw its own noti- fication if it thinks that certain members of the State Government will be unduly embarrassed by having to face inquiries by two Commissions on matters which may have some connectious or even some common areas. Indeed, to get to the heart of a transaction, its surrounding or superficial shell, which ia all that the State Commission can inquire into with regard to some transactions, may havl' to be pierced, or, to some degree, traversed before the core of these transactiom can be reached. As we hold that the two notifications authorise inquiries into matters which are substantially different in nature and object, the ('nquiry by the Grover Commission cannot be said to be barred by reason of the State Government notification under proviso ( b) to Section 3 (I) of the Act, even if, in ordrr to deal with the substantially different subject matt~r, in view ?f t~e divergmce in objects, certain areas of fact or rules governmg transactions may be common. If the objectives are different the examination of common areas of fact and law for different purposes will still be permissible. 25. Without doubting the motives of the State GovE-rnment in appoint- ing its own Commi11sion perhaps we may observe that, in a case involving charges of the kind made against the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State, it would be better if the State's own Commission did not even remotely appear to have been set up merely in anticipation of a thorough ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Although the prompt action of ,the State Government may seem quite commendable and bona tide, in appointing its own Commission in the context and circumstances disclosed above, its continued existence may not give exactly that impression after what we have held above on an analysis of the apparent objects of the two Commissions judged by the contents of the two notifications. In any case, the subject matter, not being subs- tantially same, the Central Government Commission could proceed with its investigations if other objections, which we now proceed to examine, are not really fatal to the validity of the Central Government's notification. 26. Those other objections to the validity of the Central Government's notification may be summarised as follows: 26A. Firstly, it is submitted that express provisions of the Constitution relating to the federal structure, distribution of executive and legislative powers between the State and. the Union, joint responsibility of a State's Council of Ministers, conditions under which they can hold office or may be dismissed, the State Legislature's exclusive control over their actions and ~onduct of affairs of the State Government, are infringed by it, so that, if all this could be done, under the cloak of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Act, by the Central Government, this provision of the Act is, pro tanto, invalid. -Secondly, and following logically and naturally from the first set of propositions, as their necessary consequence, the notification constitutes violations by the Central Government of what must be held to be parts of the basic features or the basic structure of the Constitution which do not permit the destruction of either federalism or democracy by issuing executive fiats. Thirdly, carrying the logic of the last mentioned set of submissions a step further, it is urged that, as the basic features of the Constitution have been held by this Court to be outside the procedure for amendment contained in Article 368 of the Constitution, it must, a fortiori, be held to be outside the legislative competence of Parliament as contemplated by Articles 245-255 in Part XI of the Constitution read with provisions of the Legislative Lists in Schedule 7. Fourthly, it is suggested, in the alternative, that, in any case, a necessary implication of the express provisions of the Constitution is that a control by the Union Government over the day-to-day working of the Governments in 'the States by the adoption of the legislative procedure found in Part XI of the Constitution must have a result which can only be achieved by a constitutional amendment under Article 368 of the Constitution. Fifthly, it is submitted that even if interference with the day-to-day working of the governmental machinery in the States is not barred by the basic structure of the Constitution, yet, the situations in which such interference is warranted, having been specifically laid down in the emergency provisions contained in Articles 352-360 found in Part ~VIII of the Constitution, any other mode of interference with the operations of State Governments, not expressly provided by the Constitution itself, must be deemed to be outside the ordinary legislative competence of Parliament. Sixthly, the plaintiff's Counsel submitted that, in any event, the provisions of the Act must be so construed or interpreted, by reading them down if necessary, as to preclude interference by the Union Government with the operations of the State Government or the conduct of its Ministers keeping in view all the submissions mentioned above.

It is true that learned Counsel for the plaintiff kept reverting to what he really meant to put forward as the basic or inviolable features of the Constitution, yet, he felt reluctant to unequivocally commit himself to the view that the Act contained provisions which constituted a violation of the basic structure of the Constitution which has been held to include both democracy and federalism. Apparently, this somewhat shifting position arose from a realisation that the Act may have very little, if anything at all, to do with provisions meant to ensure democratic government, and that our Qonstitution has, despite whatever federalism may be found in its structure, so strongly unitary features also in it that, when the totality of those provisions is examined, it becomes difficult to assert confidently how much federalism such a Constitution contains, whether, those parts of it which seem to override the federal elements of our Constitution are not more basic or significant than what is described as its federalism, and whether possible actions under the Act, intended to authorise investigation, presumably with a view to finding remedies, into whatever dishonesty or corruption may be discovered in the conduct of governmental affairs by Ministers, are not really meant to safeguard or help rather than to destroy or hinder democratic government. 28. It is interesting to note what Sir Cyril Salmon, Lord Justice of Appeal, said in a lecture on \"Tribunals of Inquiry\" : In all countries, certainly in those which enjoy freedom of speech and a free Press, moments occur when allegations and rumours circulate causing a nation-wide crisis of confidence in the integrity of public life or about other matters of vital public importance. No doubt this rarely happens, but when i(does, it is essential that public confidence should be restored, for without it no democracy can long survive. This confidence can be effectively restored only by thoroughly investi- gating and probing the rumours and allegations so as to search out and establish the truth. The truth may show that the evil exists, thus enabling it to be rooted out, or that there is no foundation in the rumours and allegations by which the public has been disturbed. In either case, confidence is restored. 29. In the lecture mentioned above, it was pointed out that the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, was passed in England to displace the procedure by which Select Parliamentary Committees were used \"to investigate alleged wrongdoing in high places\". About the Select Committee procedure he said : Such a method of investigation by a political tribunal was wholly unsatisfactory. Being a progressive people it took us only little more than about 300 years to do anything about it. In the United States of America, however, which is still more progressive than we are, they still use virtually the same method. Congressional Committees of investigation, like our Parliamentary Committees, consist of mem hers representing the relative strength of the majority and minority parties. Clearly such bodies can never be free from party political influences. This is a very real defect in any tribunal investigating allegations of public misconduct-particularly as the subject matter of the inquiry often has highly charged political overtones. He observed : The hi$tory of such investigations in England by Parliamentary Committees is, to say the least, unfortunate.

In 1912 the Post Master General in a Liberal Government accepted a tender by the English Marconi Com- pany for the construction of State-owned wireless telegraph stations throughout the Empire. There followed widespread rumours that the Government had corruptly favoured the Marconi Company and that certain prominent members of the Government had improperly profited by the transaction. The Select Parliamentary Committee appointed to investigate these rumours represented the respective strengths of the Liberal and Conservative Parties. The majority report of the Liberal members of the Committee exonerated the members of the Government concerned whereas a minority report by the Conservative members of the Committee found that these members of the Government had been guilty of gross impropriety. When the reports came to be debated in the House of Commons, the House divided on strictly party lines and by a majority exonerated the Ministers from all blame. This is the last instance of a matter of this kind being investigated by a Select Committee of Parliament. In other words, • 'it was because in England investigation by a political tribunal of matters causing grave public disquiet had been discredited that the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, was passed, with a view to setting up some permanent investigating machinery to be available for use when required\". Furthermore, he pointed out that even in America ad hoe tribunals are not infrequently appointed to avoid a matter being referred to a Congressional Committee, as, for example, the Warren Commission to investigate the murder of President Kennedy . 30. It is thus clear that in democratic countries not only modern practice but statute can provide for inquiries of the kind which are meant to be conducted under our Act of 1952. The Preamble of our Act shows that it was meant to \"provide for appointment of the Commissions of Inquiry and for vesting such Commissions with certain powers\". Section I, sub-section (2) of the Act indicates that it extends to the whole of India; but, a proviso to it puts certain limitations to which its operation is subjected so far as the State of Jammu & Kashmir is concerned inasmuch as, for this State, inquiries set up must relate to matters appertaining to such entries in List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule as may9be applicable to the State. There is nothing in the Act to show any such limitations with regard to any other State. 31 . Section 2 of the Act provides: 2.

After the two sections, set out above, which disclose the apparently very wide and undefined scope of inquiries to be conducted under the Act, the only limit being that they must relate to matters of \"definite public importance\", follow sections conferring upon Commissions under the Act powers of a civil court for the purpose of eliciting evidence, both oral and documentary, and powers to punish those guilty of its contempts. Section 6 of the Act, however, makes it clear that statements made by a person in the course of his evidence before the Commission ''will not subject him to or be used against him in any civil or criminal proceeding except in a prosecution for giving false evidence by making such statements11 • But, this protection is not extended to statements made in reply to questions not required by the Commission to be answered, or, those made on matters which are not relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiry. The Act, however, contains no provisions for giving any effect to the findings of the Commission or for enforcing any order which could be made by the Commission against any person as a result of an inquiry . In fact, the only orders a Commission under the Act is empowered to make against anybody are those relating to adduction of evidence, whether oral or documentary, and those which may be required to protect the Commission against \"acts calculated to bring the Commission or any member thereof into disrepute\". The proceedings of a Commission could only result in a Report which is to be laid before the Legislature concerned under the provisions of Section 3(4) of the Act. Hence, the obvious intention behind the Act is to enable the machinery of democratic government to function more efficiently and effectively. It could hardly be construed as an Act meant to thwart democratic methods of government. 34. Even in countries with undiluted unitary systems of Government there is devolution of powers of local self-Government for restricted purposes. In our country, there is, at the top, a Central or the Union Government responsible to Parliament, and there are, below it, State Governments, responsible to the State Legislatures, each functioning within the sphere of its own powers which are divided into two categories; the exclusive and the concurrent. Within the exclusive sphere of the powers of the State Legislature is local Government. And, in all States there is a system of local Government in both urban and rural areas, functioning under State enactments. Thus, we can speak of a three-tier system of Government in our country in which the Central or the Union Government comes. at the apex with certain subjects which are exclusively left to the States concerned ordinarily or in normal times. But, even problems which arise within the territories of States may fall within the sphere of overriding Central power in emergencies . And, if a subject is considered important enough to be regarded as the concern of the whole nation, the Constitution makers have th emselves placPd it either in the exclusively Central Legislative List I or m the concurrent Legislative List Ill of items mentioned in Schedule VII. 35.

There the people of India living in the States and of the Union Territories are directly represented so that their interests and rights could be presumed to be well looked after and protected by their direct representatives. The Council of States has 12 members in it nominated by the President for their special knowledge or experience in matters of art, science, or social service, and not more than 238 representatives of the States and elected by members of the legislative assembly of each State in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote and from the Union Territories in the manner prescribed by law made by the Parlia- ment (Article 80). The representation of the legislative bodies of the States and of the Union Territories is certainly a. recognition of the federal principle. But, this does not mean that the Central Government is precluded from all interference in matters concerning individual States. For determin- ing the extent of that interference and the circumstances in which it is possible we have to turn to other provisions of our Constitution. 36. Article 245\\ l) of our Constitution gives the territorial operations of the laws made by Parliament and the State Legislatures. Article 246(1) t.nacts that items in List I of the Seventh Schedule fall exclusively within the domain of Parliament and those in List II come exclusively within the legislative power of the State Legislatures, but those in List III are to be concurrent. Article 248, however, vests Parliament with exclusive power to legislate with respect to matters not enumerated in either the concurrent or State list. This is what is spoken of generally as the \"residuary power\". In addition, Parliament has overriding powers of legislating even for matters in the State list for limited durations if the Council of States by resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of its members declares that it is necessary to do so in national interest or during the continuance of a proclamation of emergency (Articles 249 and 250). Inconsistency between laws made by the Parliament and a State Legislature, on an item found in a concurrent list, is to be resolved in favour of the law made by Parliament (Article 254). And, far-reaching powers, contained in Articles 352-360 in Part XVIII of the Constitution, enable the President to suspend not only the enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens, and their operation as fetters on legislative powers, but also the functions of the State Legislatures which can be assumed by Parliament and of State Governments which can be taken over by the President. It is true that the emergency powers are so drastic th::tt they can be abused. We have not, however, got before us a case of the exercise of emergency powers or of abuse of powers. We are only considering here the extents of what are put forward as federal and democratic features of Government which may or may not be capable of suspension. As the Constitution stand!! at present, the exercise of the emergency powers, whose validity is not questioned before us by any party in this case, can completely remove even the semblance of a federal structure in our Constitution for the duration of an emergency. 37. A look at Chapter II of Part XI on administrative relations between the Union and the States, shows us provisions for directions. which can be given to the State Governments even in normal times by the Central Govern- ment described in Articles 256-257, as \"the Government of India\".

(1) The executive power of every State shall be so exercised as not to impede or prejudice the exercise of the executive power of the Union, and the executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for that purpose. 38. The extent of the normal executive powers of the Union are indicated as follows by Article 73(1) of the Constitution: 73. (I) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of the Union shall extend- ( a) to the matters with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws; and ( b) to the exercise of such rights, authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable by the Government of India by virtue of any treaty or agreement : Provided that the executive power referred to in sub-clause (a) shall not, save as expressly provided in this Constitution or in any law made by Parliament, extend in any State to matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has also power to make laws. And, the extent and limitations of the executive power of a State are given in Article 162 as follows : 162. Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws : Provided that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of a. Stat(' and Parliament have power to make laws, the executive power of the State shall be subject to, and limited by, the executive power expressly conferred by this Constitution or by any law made by Parlia- ment upon the Union or authorities thereof. 39. The wide scope of executive powers of the Union Government was considered by this Court not long ago in Stale of Rajasthan v. Union of India1, where, after examining the relevant constitutional provisions, one of us observed in the context of what was sought to be construed as a \"direction\" to the State Government, given by the Home Minister in the Union Govern- ment, to dissolve a State Assembly: (SCC pp. 623-24) I may point out that there are various aspectll of relations between the Union and the States governed by different provisions of the Constitution.

Articles 256 and 257 mention a wide range of subjects on which the Union Government may give executive directions to State Governments. Article 73{l)(a) of the Constitution tells us that the executive power of the Union extends to all matters on which \"Parliament has power to make laws\". Article 248 of the Constitution vests exclusively in the Parliament residuary powers of making laws on any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent or State Lists. Article 256 ~f the Constitution covers cases where the President may want to give directions in exercise of the executive power of the Union to a State Government in relation to a matter covered by an existing law made by Parliament which applies to that State. But, Article 257( 1) imposes a wider obliga- tion upon a State to exercise its powen in such a way as not to impede the exercise of executive power of the Union which, as would appear from Article 73 of the Constitution, read with Article 248 may cover even a subject on which there is no existing law but on which some legislation by Parliament is possible. It could, therefore, be argued that although, the Constitution itself does not lay down specifically when the power of dissolution should be exercised by the Governor on the advice of a Council of Ministers in the State, yet if a direction on that matter was properly given by the Union Government to a State Government, (here is a duty to carry it out. The time for the diasolution of a State Assembly is not covered by any specific provision of the Constitution or any law made on the subject. It is possible, however, for the Union Government, in exercise of its residuary executive power to consider it a fit subject for the issue of an appropriate direction when it considers that the political situation in the country is such \"that a fresh election is necessary in the interest of political stability or to establish the confidence of the people in the Government of a State. 40. In th.at case, after considering the extent of federalism in our Constitution it was also observed (p. 1383) (SCC p. 623) : If then our Constitution creates a Central Government which is 'amphibian' in the sense that it can move either on the federal or unitary plane, according to the needs of the situation and circumstances of a case, the question which we are driven back to consider is whether an 3.3.Sessment of the 'situation' in which the Union Government should move either on the federal or unitary plane are matters for the Union Government itself or for this Court to consider and determine.

In the first quotation given above, what was spoken of as a \"resi- duary executive power\" of the Central Government, analogous to the \"residuary\" legislative powers of Parliament, was relied upon in support of the alleged \"direction\" from the Centre. In the case before us it could certainly be urged that a consideration of the question whether a State Government or its Chief Minister is or is not carrying out the trust which constitutional power places in the hands of a State Government and its head, so as to determine whether any exercise of extraordinary powers under Article 356 of the Constitution is called for or not, is certainly a m~!~er ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

UNION OF1NDIA (Beg, C.J.) 649 which lay within the powers of the Central Government, Article 356 speaks of the \"satisfaction\" of the President from a report of the Governor \"or otherwise\" whether a particular situation has arisen in which the Govern- ment of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Such a matter would certainly be a matter of public im- portance. If the President deems it necessary tt, give the State Government or its Chief Minister an opportunity of being heard before.an impai;tial Commission of Inquiry constituted under the Act, it could certainly not be said that such a mode of exercise of power under Article 356 is not fully covered by what is necessarily implied by this article of the Constitution. Indeed, such a procedure would be a very fair and reasonable one. And, in judging the validity of provisions even hypothetical situations to which they could apply could be taken into account and not merely those p~esent in the case before the Court. We do not think that an examination of the express provisions of the Constitution advances the case of the plaintiff. On the other hand, the Central Government can place reliance on, inter alia\" provisions of Article 356 of the Constitution for powers which co~d be held to be necessarily implied in the provisions of the Constitution-that is to say, a power to order an inquiry for the purposes of the satisfaction required by Article 356. And the machinery provided by tl-.. e Act could, it seems to us, be utilised to decide whether action under Article 356 is really called for. 42. Reliance was, however, placed strongly on provisions CJf the Cons- titution setting up what, in the words of Dr. Ambedkar, one of the prime architects of our Constitution, is \"a Dual Polity\" by which, as was explain- ed in the case of State of Rajasthan (supra), he meant a Republic \"both unitary as well as federal\" according to the ne,eds of the time and circum- stances. This \"Dual Polity\" of ours is a product of historical accidents, or, at any rate, of circumstances other than those which result in genuine federa- tions in which the desire for a separate identity and governmental indepen- dence of the federating urAits is so strong that nothing morf: than a union with a strictly demarcated field of Central Government's powers is possible. A confederal polity carries the attenuation of Central authority to the extent of confining combined or concerted action to the more strictly limited field of collaboration only to matters such as foreign affairs and defence so that it sets up a mechanism of cooperative action in limited areas which can hardly be spoken of as a Government. A genuine federation is a combina- tion of political units which adhere rather tenaciously to the exclusion of the Central authority from strictly de\\I).arcated spheres of State action, but there is a Central or Federal \"Government\". The extent of Federalism set up depends upon the extent of demarcation in the executive, legislative and judicial spheres. In a truly Federal Constitution this demarcation is carried out in a very carefully comprehensive and detailed manner. The limits are clearly specified. We will thus have to examine our Constitution to deter- mine how much of it is found here . 43. No doubt, throughout the long course of our history, our successive rulers had been trying to build up a unity of India by establishing their im- perial sway politically and administratively over the whole country, but, it was really the British who succeeded in giving reality to such an objective. And, even they preserved a duality of systems of Government. There was a British India under the Governor-General presiding over the destinies of the various provinces under Governors as Imperial sub-agents, but all acting on behalf of an Empnor whose governments ruled from Westminster and Whitehall.

These two parts were sought to be knitted together into a federal polity by the Government of India Act, 1935. Federal principles, including a F ederal Court, were embodied in it so as to bring to- gether and co-ordinate two different types of political systems and sets of authorities. But, after the Constitution of our Republic, came the gradual disappearance of Princely States and a unification of India in a single polity with duality of agencies of Government only for the purposes of their more effectivt! and efficient operations under a Central direction. It was, more or less, an application of the principle of division of labour under at least Cen- tral supervision. In other words, the duality or duplication of organs of government on the Central and State levels did not reflect a truly federal d emarcation of powers based on any separatist sentiments which could threaten the sovereignty and integrity of the Indian Republic to which mem- bers of our Constituent Assembly seemed ardently devoted, particularly after an unfortunate division of the country with certain obviously disastrous results. ff. However, we may examine the express provisions of our Constitu- tion r elating to the organs of Government in the States which, no doubt, give the appearance of full-fledged separate States for certain purposes. Each State has its own Governor exercising the executive power of that State. But, all Governors, although undertaking to devote themselves to the service and well-being of the people- of their respective States, owe an undivided allegiance to '' the Constitution and the law\". Each of them is appointed by the President and holds office during the pleasure of the President to whom he sends his reports with a view to any proposed action under Article 356 of the Constitution. The Governor's authority, under the warrant of his appointm e nt, is traceable to the President to whom he is to submit his resignation if h e resigns. 45. Article 163 speaks of the Council of Ministers \"with the Chief Minister at th e head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, f'xcept in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to C'Xercise his functions or any of them in his discretion\". Now, the Council of Ministers, theore tically appointed by the Governor, is certainly \"collec- tively responsible to the L egislative Assembly of the State\" [see: Article 164(2)]. But, this \" collective r esponsibility\" does not, as has been errone- ously att C'mpted to be argued before us, abridge or truncate the power of the C entral Government to appoint a Commission under Section 3 of the Act. In fact, this \"collective responsibility\" has a scope and mode of operation which are ve ry different from those of an inquiry under Section 3 of the Act ev Pn though the same or similar matters may, sometimes, give rise to both. \"Collectiv e responsibility\" is basically political in origin and modP of operation. It may arise even in cases which may not call for any inquiry under Section 3 of the Act. And, matters investigated under Section 3 of the Act may have no bearing on any \"collective responsibility\". 46. ThP object of collective responsibility is to make the whole body of persons holding Ministerial office collectively, or, if one may so put it; \"vicariously\" responsible for such acts of the others as are referable to their collective volition so that, even if an individual may not be personally res- ponsible for it, yet, he will be deemed to share the responsibility with those who may have actually committed some wrong.

UNION OF lNDIA (Beg, C.J.) 651 mission has been ordered by the Central Government so as to determine who is actually responsible for certain actions and what could be the motive be- hind them. The sphere of this enquiry is very different from that in which \"collective responsibility\" functions. Explaining \"collective responsibility\", as understood in England, two writers on constitutional matters (see: \"Some Problems of the Constitution\" by Geoffrey Marshal! and Graeme C. Moodie) say: (at p. 71): If responsibility is taken in the formal constitutional sense, there would seem, granted collective governtnental responsibility, to be no clear distinction to be drawn between Ministers inside and those outside the Cabinet. To be responsible in this sense simply is to share the con- sequences of responsibility-namely to be subject to the rule that no member of the Government may properly remain a member and dis- sociate himself f,rom its policies ( except on occasions when the Govern- ment permits a free vote in the House). They add: The substance of the Government's collective responsibility could be defined as its duty to sub~t its policy to and defend its policy before the House of Commons, and to resign if defeated on an issue of confi• dence. 47. Each Minister can be and is separately responsible for his own decisions and acts and omissions also. But, inasmuch as the Council of Ministers is able to stay in office only so long as it commands the support and confidence of a majority of members of the Legislature of the State, the whole Council of Ministers must be held to be politically responsible for the decisions and policies of each of the Ministers and of his department which could be presumed to have the support of the whole Ministry. Hence, the whole Ministry will, at least on issues involving matters of policy, have to be treated as one entity so far as its answerability to the Legislative Assembly representing the electors is concerned. This is the meaning of the principle underlying Article 164(2) of the Constitution. The purpose of this provision is not to find out facts or to establish the actual responsibility of a Chief Minister or any other Minister or · Ministers for particukr decisions or Governmental acts. That can be more suitably done, when wrongful acts or decisions are complained of, by means of inquiries under the Act. As already indicated above, the procedure of Parliamentary Committees to in- quire into every legally or ethically wrong act was found to be unsatisfactory and unsdund. The principle of individual as well as collective ministerial responsibility can work most efficiently only when cases requiring proper sifting and evaluation of evidence and discussion of questions involved have taken place, where this is required, in proceedings before a Commission appointed under Section 3 of the Act. 48. Text-book writers on Constitutional Law have indicated how collective ministerial responsibility to Parliament, which has essentially a political purpose and effects, developed later than individual responsibility of Ministers to Parliament which was also political in origin and operation. It is true that an individual Minister could, in England, where the principle of individual and collective responsibility of Ministers was evolved, be res- ponsible either for wrongful acts done by him without the authority of the whole cabinet or of the monarch to support them, or under orders of the King who could, in the eye of law, do no wrong.

For establishing his legal liability recourse to ordinary courts of law is indispensable. 49. Responsibility to Parliament only means that the Minister may be compelled by convention to resign. Out of this liability arose the principle of collective responsibility. Thus, in Wade and Phillips on \"Constitutional Law\" Eighth Edn., p. 87, we find: \"Just as it became recognised that a single Minister could not retain office against the will of Parliament, so later it became clear that all Ministers must stand or fail together in Parliament, if the Government was to be carried on as a unity rather than by a number of advis-ers of the Sovereign acting separately,,. This development of collective responsibility was thus described in 1878 by Lord Salisbury : For all that passes in Cabinet every member of it who does not resign is absolutely and irretrievably responsible and has no right after- wards to say that he agreed in one case to a compromise, while in another he was persuaded by his colleagues. . . . It is only on the principle that absolute responsibility is undertaken by every member of the Cabinet, who, after a decision is arrived at, remains member of it, that the joint responsibility of Ministers to Parliament can be upheld and one of the most essential principles of parliamentary responsibility esta- blished. 50. The whole qu<'stion of responsibility is related to the continuance of a l\\tlinister or a Government in office. A Minister's own acts or omissions or those of others in the department in his charge, for which he may feel morally responsible, or, for which others may hold him morally responsible, may compel him to resign. By an extension of this logic, applied to indivi- dual Ministers at first, emerged the principle of \"collective responsibility,. which we find enacted in Articles 75(2) and 164(2) of our Constitution. The only sanction for its enforcement is the pressure of public opinion ex- pressed particularly in terms of withdrawal of political support by membns of Parliament or the State Legislature as the ciJe may be. 51. As Prof. S. A. de Smith points out in his Constitutional and Adminis- trative Law, 1971, at p. 170 to 179, the principle operates in a nebulous moral-cum-political sphere, sometimes forcing an individual Minister to re:.ign, u in the case of Mr. Profumo, and, on other occasions, involving the fate of the whole Ministry, depending upon the extent to which the Cabinet as a whole could be, in the circumstances of a particular case, deemed to be responsible for a particular decision or action or inaction. In England, the principle operates as a matter of convention backed by political judgment, as reflected in Parliament whereas, for us, the principle is stated in our Constitution itself, but it, nevertheless, depends upon convention and upon public opinion, particularly as. reflected_ in Parliament or _in _the State Legislature, as the case may he, for its effectiveness. The prmc1ple thus exists separately and indrpendentiy from the legal liability of a Minister, holding an office in the Union or a State Government. 52. An investigation by a Commission of Inquiry should facilitate or help the formation. of sou1;1d public opinion.

UNION OF INDIA (Beg, C.J.) 653 responsible to the House for a wrong statement made to it did not prevent an inquiry by a Commission into matters on which he had made the state- ment. His individual actions, however, did not bring into operation the principle of collective responsibility becaul>e his colleagues in the Government could not reasonably be held guilty of dereliction or breach of any duty. 53. A Commission of Inquiry could not properly be meant, as is some- times suspected, to merely whitewash ministerial or departmental action rather than to explore and discover, if possible, real facts. It is also not meant to serve as a mode of prosecution and much less of persecution. Proceedings before it cannot serve as substitutes for proceedings which should take place before a court of law invested with powers of adjudication as well as of awarding punishments or affording reliefs. Its report or findings cannot relieve Courts which may have to determine for themselves matters dealt with by a Commission. Indeed, the legal relevance or evidentiary value of a Commission's report or findings on issues which a Court may have to decide for itself, is very questionable. The appointment of a Commission of Inquiry to investigate a matter which should, in the ordinary course, have gone to a Court of law is generally a confession of want of sufficient t'vidence --as in the case of the appointment of the Warren Commission in the U.S .A. to inquire into facts concerning the murder of the late President Kenn<'dy- to take it to Court combined with an attempt to satisfy the public need and desire to discover what had really gone wrong and how and where if possible. A Commission of Inquiry has, therefore, a function of its own to fulfil. It has an orbit of action of its own within which it can move so as not to con- flict with or impede other forms of action or modes of redress. Its report or findings are not immune from criticism if they are either not fair and impartial or are unsatisfactory for other reasons as was said to be the case with the Warren Commission's rt'port. St. Provisions of either Article 75(2) or Article I 64(2) could not operate as bars against the institution of inquiries by Commissions set up under the Act. To infer such bars as their necessary consequences would be to misunderstand the object as well as the mode and sphere of operation of the principles found in both Articles 75(2) and 164(2) of the Constitution and also the purpose, scope, and function of Commissions of Inquiry s-et up under the Act. 55. In a somewhat desperate attempt to find some constitutional prohibition against the inquiries on which the Grover Commission has embarked, learned Counsel for the plaintiff relied on Article 194(3) of the Constitution. The particular clause (3) of Article 194 has to be read in the context of other clauses of Article 194 as well as the remaining provisions of the Constitution as indicated by Article 194(1). We may here set out the whole of Article 194 which reads as follows : 194. ( l) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and to the rules and standing orders regulating the proct'dure of the Legislature, there shall be freedom of speech in the Legislature of every State. (2) No member of the Legislature of a State shall be liable to any proceedings in any Court in respect of anything said or any vote given by him in the Legislature or any rommittee thereof, ann no person shall be so liable in respect of thl'.' publication by or under the authority of a House of such a Legislature of any report, paper, votes or proceedings.

( 4) The provisions of clauses ( 1), (2) and (3) shall apply in relation to persons who by virtue of this Constitution have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of, a House of the Legis- lature of a State or any committee thereof as they apply in relation to members of that Legislature. 56. Article 194 reproduces the terms of Article 105 with this evident difference that, whereas Article 194 is applicable to Houses of a State Legis- lature, Article 105 applies to the two Houses of Parliament. Each of these two articles subjects \"the powers, privileges and immunities\" of each House as well as all its Members and its Committees not only to the laws made by the appropriate h•gislature but also to all the other provisions of the Constitu• tion. It is clear, from these articles, that they do not apply to Legislative powers of Parliament or of the State Legislatures which are specifically dealt with by Articles 245 to 255 of the Constitution. Articles 105 and 194, far from dealing with the legislative powers of Houses of Parliament or of State Legislatures respectively, are confined in scope to such powers of each House as it may exercise separatelf functioning as a House. It also covers immunities and privileges o each House as a House as well as of its mem• hers. The correct principle of interpretation to apply is \"rwscitur a sociis\", or, in other words, the word \"powers\" gets its meaning and colour not only from its context but also from the other words used in association with it. 57. It is evident, from the Chapter in which Article 194 occurs ~s well as the heading and its marginal note that the \"powers\" meant to be indica- ted here are not independent. They are powers which depend upon and are necessary for the conduct of the business of each House . They cannot also be expanded into those of the House of Commons in England for all pur• poses. For example, it.could not be contended that each House of a State Legislature has the same share of legi~ative power as the House of Commons has, as a constituent part of a completely sovereign legislature. Under our law it is the Constitution which is sovereign or supreme. The Parliament as well as each Legislature of a State in India enjoys only such legislative powers as the Constitution confers upon it. S,milarly, each House of Parliament or State Legislature has such share in legislative power as is assigned to it by the Constitution itself. The powers conferred on a House of a State Legislature are distinct from the legislative powers of either Parlia- ment or of a State Legislature for which, as already observed, there are separate provisions in our Constitution. We need not travel beyond the words of Article 194 itself, read with other provisions of the Constitution, to clearly reach such a conclusion. 58. There is, if we may say so, considerable confusion still in the minds of some pf'ople as to the scope of the undefined \"powers, privileges and immunities\" of a House of a State Ltgislature so much so that it has some- times been imagined that a House of a State Legislature has some judicial or quasi-judicial powers also, quite apart from its recognised powers of punishment for its contempts or the power of investigations it may carry out by the appointment of its own committees.

UNION OP INDIA (Beg, C.J.) 655 if it was clearly understood that, even in England, where the Constitution is largely conventional, the exercise of judicial powers directly by Houses of the Legislature, including powers such as those of impeachment, are practically obsolete. Whatever remained of the power enjoyed once by the High Court of Parliament, when the King could himself sit, as a part of Parliament with the Houses of Parliament, to administer justice is now con- centrated in the House of Lords, exercised through a Committee of Law Lords. 59. Every power of the House of Parliament in England is subject to an Act of Parliament . The Act with which we are concerned is an Act of our Parliament. We have to satisfy ourselves by reference to our Consti- tution and not the British Constitution that the provisions of the Act before us are within the legislative competence of Parliament. But, if we could ignore the provisions of our Constitution relating to distribution of legislative powers, which is what the arguments based on Article 194(3) seem to imply, we would be left with no yard-stick for determining the legislative compe- tence of our Parliament. It would be absurd to take that view simply because that is the position in England. Nobody could, in England, question the validity of an Act of Parliament on the ground that it is in excess of the power vested in a sovereign Parliament to legislate. If we c;:ould apply that principle here the Act before us would be a sufficient answer to all argument against its validity. 60. If that principle does not apply in our country because of the provisions of our Constitution, which constitute courts judges of constitu- tionality of even Acts of Parliament, we have to test the provisions of the Act on the anvil of express provisions of our own Constitution and not on the erroneously supposed powers of a House of Commons in England which could never ignore or invalidate the provisions of any Act made by the Parliament there although it could play a decisive role in its repeal if it so desired. 61. A source of confusion about the \"powers\" and \"privileges\" of the House of Commons even in England was sought to be removed long ago by Sir Erskine May when he pointed out in his \"Parliamenta,y Procedura and Practice\", in 1844, that Coke's dictum and Blackstone's views, according to which the ordinary law courts could not judge matters relating to \"Lex Parliamenti\", on the ground that \"the High Court of Parliament hath no higher\", were out of date even in Seventeenth Century England. He said about such views: The views belonged to a time when the distinction between the judicial and legislative functions of Parliament was undraw11 or only beginning to be drawn and when the separation of the Lords from the Commons was much less complete than it was in the Seventeenth Century. Views about the High Court of Parliament and its powers which were becoming antiquated in the time of Coke, continued to be repeated far into the Eighteenth Century, although after the Restoration principles began to be laid down which were more in accord with the facts of the modern Constitution. But much confusion remained which was not dismissed by the use of the phrase \"privileges of Parliament\". 62. Sir Erskine May went on to indicate ~he three notions resulting from this \"confusion of thought\" in the course of English Constitutional ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

He wrote: Three notions arise from this confusion of thought : (I) That the courts, being inferior to the High Court of Parlia- ment, cannot call in question, the decision of either Home on a matter of privilege. (2) That the lex et conseutudo parlia~nti is a separate law, and, therefore, unknown to the courts. (3) That a Resolution of either House declaratory of privilege is a judicial precedent binding on the courts. 63. Now, what learned Counsel for the plaintiff seemed to suggest was that Ministers, answerable to a Legislature were governed by a separate law which exempted them from liabilities under the ordinary law. This was never the Law in England. And, it is not so here. Our Constitution leaves no scope for such arguments, based on a confusion concerning the \"powers\" and \"privileges\" of the House of Commons mentioned in Articles 105(3) and l 94(3). Our Constitution vests only legislative power in Parliament as well as in the State Legislatures. A House of Parliament or State Legis- lature cannot try anyonP or any case directly, as a Court of Justice can, but it can proceed quasi-judicially in cases of contempts of its authority and take up motions concerning its \"privileges\" and \"immunities\" because, in doing so, it only seeks removal of obstructions to the due performance of its legislative functions. But, if any question of jurisdiction arises as to whether a matter falls h€re or not, it has to be decided by the ordinary courts in appropriate proceedings. For example, the jurisdiction to try a criminal offence, such as murder, committed even within a House vests in ordinary criminal courts and not in a House of Parliament or in a State Legislature. In Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain 2 , this Court held that a House of Parliament cannot, in exercisP of any supposed \"powers\" under Article 105, dccidt· election disputes for which special authorities. hav~ been constituted under the Representation of People Act, 1951, enacted in com- pliance with Article 329. Similarly, appropriate provisions for appointments of suitable persons, invested with power to determine, in accordance with a procedure which is fair and just and regular and efficient, for ascertainment of facts on matters of public importance, is provided by the Act. If such provisions ar<' covered by specific provisions relating to legislative competence of Parliament and one of the items in Central List I or the Concurrent List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, we need not go to other provisions which would, strictly speaking not be relevant unless th ey could be relied upon to clearly carve out some exception operating against such legislative competence. 64. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff has relied also upon the provisions of Chapter II, P,\\rt XI, containing Articles 256 to 263 of the Constitution. Here, we find A1·ticles 256 and 257(1) of the Constitution which we have already examined above to bring out the extent of Government of India's power to give necessary directions to every StatP. Th0 term \"State\" used there could not possibly be held to apply merely to a geographical entity or territory. Article l, sub-article (2) and Article 3 of our Constitution make a distinction be tween \"the State\" and its territory.

Hence, \"directions\" to the \"State\", as these terms are used in Articles 256 and 257, must necessarily mean directions to States as legal entities which must have legal representa- tives. There need be no difficulty in treating State Governments as representatives of their respective individual States. Can we, with such a Constitution as ours, say that the Union Government must take no interest, and, consequently, no action whatsoever which savours of interference with governmental functions of a State Government? In the Dissolution of State Assemblies case (supra) we have already stated the views of this Court on such a subject at some length indicating there the kind of federation we have in this country with what has been characterised as \"a strong unitary bias\", or, at any rate, with powers given to the Union Government of supervision and even supersession, in certain circumstances, of State Government tem- porarily to restore normalcy or to inject honesty, integrity, and efficiency into State administrations where these essentials of good government may be wanting. 65. Neither Chapter II, Part XI of the Constitution, dealing with the administrative relations between the Union and the States, nor any other part of the Constitution could• be held to imply a prohibition against the exercise of any legislative power of Parliament. Indeed, a glance through Chapter II in Part XI shows that, apart from Articles 256 and 257(1), it deals only with some special matters, such as maintenance of national high- ways, waterways, and railways, constructions to be undertaken for objects of national or military importance, delegation of certain powers, some arbitrations, recognition throughout the territory of India of certain public acts and judicial proceedings of the Union and of every State, determination of disputes relating to waters, and certain other matters involving co-ordina- tion between the States. It could not be said to exhaust all matters which may involve the interests of particular States as well as of the Union. There is nothing in any of the provisions here or elsewhere in our Co~stitution which could, by a necessary implication, be said to impose conditions on the exercise of legislative powers distributed by Chapter I of Part XI of the Constitution read with the three lists in the Seventh Schedule. Such a question must, therefore, be determined exclusively by the provisions of Chapter I of Part XI which refer us to the legislative lists in the Seventh Schedule. We cannot forget that we are really concerned here with legislative powers and not with administrative relations or directions. It is true that those powers cannot be so exercised as. to displace or amend the Constitution. But, unless they have that effect, provisions meant to supplement and facili- tate due discharge of constitutional powers cannot be deemed to be in excess of ordinary legislative power. 66. Entry 94 in List I of exclusively Central subjects of legislation reads as follows: 94. Inquiries, surveys and statistics for the purpose of any of the matters in this list. It is true that matters affecting relations between the Union Government and the State Government are not found mentioned specifically anywhere in the Union List. It was, therefore, urged that \"inquiries,, mentioned here, even if they extend beyond surveys and statistics, must, nevertheless, be confined to \"matters in this list\".

We do not think that the term \"constitutional law\" can be either clearly or exhaustively defined although its nature can be roughly indicated i~ the way in which text-book writers have attempted to do it. For example, Professors E. C . S. Wade and Godfrey Phillips (See: Constitutional Law, Eighth Ed. page 4) say : There is no hard and fast definition of constitutional law. In the generally accepted use of the term it means the rules which regulate the structure of the principal organs of government and their relationship to each other, and determine their principal functions. In other words, it could be expected to contain only the basic framework. It is not part of its nature to exhaustively deal with all governmental matters. 68. As there is no written Constitution in Britain, the authors quoted above said: \"the Constitution has no separate existence since it is the ordi- nary law of the land\". They added : \"There is a common body of law which forms the Constitution, partly statutory, partly common law, and partly conventions\". It is not possible in England to equate all that passes as \"constitutional law\" with rules enforceable through Courts of law because conventions, which cannot be so enforced, are also, apparently, treated as parts of it since they also contain rules of conduct. Thus, not all \"constitu- tional law\" need be written or be even ''law\" in the commonly accepted sense of this term. In any case, there can be no clear cut distinction between what could or should and what could not or should not be comprehended within the body of rules called \"constitutional law\". In practice, it will be found that what is embodied even in a written Constitution depends some- times on the peculiar notions for the time being of people who make it. It reflects their views about what should be considered so basic or fundamental as to find a place in the constitutional document. For example, one of the provisions of the Swiss Constitution of 1893 prohibits \"sticking of animals for butchers' meat unless they have previously been stunned\". According to normal notions of \"constitutional law\", such a subject should not have found a place in it. Others think that a constitution should contain nothing more than the barest possible outlines of the structure of the Government of a country. The test, whether \"constitutional law\" or not, could be done by the exercise of ordinary legislative powers. 69. Prof. K. C. Wheare, in his\" Modern Constitutions\", wrote a chapter on \"What a constitution should contain\", where he observes: A glance at the Constitutions of different countries shows at once that people differ very much in what they think it necessary for a Consti- tution to contain . The Norwegians were able to say all that they wanted to say in about twenty-five pages; the Indians occupy about two hundred and fifty pages in their Constitution of l 950. A principal line of division is found between those who regard a Constitution as primarily and almost exclusively a legal document in which, therefore, there is a place for rules of law but for practically nothing else, and those who ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

UNION OP INDIA (Beg, C.J.) 659 think of a Constitution as a sort of manifesto, a confession of faith, a statement of ideals, a 'charter of the land', as Mr. Podsnap called it. He opined that \"the one essential characteristic of the ideal or the best form of Constitution is that it should be the shortest possible\". And, Chief Justice John Marshall of the United States said in 1819 in McCulloch v. Maryland': A Constitution to contain an accurate detail of all the sub-divisions of which its great powers will admit, and of all the means by which they may be carried into execution, would partake of the prolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind. It would probably never be understood by the public. Its nature, therefore, requires that only its great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be dedqced from the nature of the objects themselves. 70. It is true that our Constitution-makers did not try to conform to the standards indicated above. This was due largely to the historical background and the manner of our Constitution making. We did not start with a clean slate. We accepted as our starting point the scheme embodied in the Government of India Act, 1935, enacted by the British Parliament evidently in an attempt to provide quite a comprehensive and foolproof set of legal rules for the governance of our country. On it, were engrafted a set of provisions containing principles, sometimes conflicting, culled from the Constitutions of various countrier, including Japan, and results of judicial wisdom and experience gathered from all corners of the earth, so that we have a Constitution which, as Mr. Granville Austin suggests in his book on \"The Indian Constitution : The Cornerstone of a .Nation\", resembles a coat of various colours. 71. Our Constitution may be lengthy and considerably more com- prehensive and elaborate than Constitutions of other countries. Neverthe- less, to expect its contents to be so all-embracing as to necessarily specify and deal with every conceivable topic of legislation on all constitutional matters exhaustively, with sufficient particulars, so as to leave no room for doubt as to what Juld be meant by it-as though a topic of legislation had to be stated, with necessary particulars, like a charge to an accused person-is to expect the humanly impracticable if not the impossible. And, to build an argument founded on the supposed reasonableness of such an expectation and some loosely drafted comprehensive definition of either \"constitutional law\" or a \"Constitution\", to convince us that what is not so specified and identifiable as a subject of legislation, given in the Constitution, must be necessarily prohibited at least as a topic of ordinary legislation, although it may become permissible by an amendment of the Constitution, by an addition to it, appears very unrealistic to us. At any rate, our Constitution does not inhibit the growth or development of supplementary constitutional law through channels other than Article 368. 72. Excessive particularity is not consistent, as already indicated above with the generally accepted notions of a basic or what may be characterised as the \"structural\" law of the State delineating its broad basic features only. The most that could be expected from the human foresight of Constitution- makers is that they should provide for that residual power of legislation which could cover topics on which, consistently with the constitutional 3. 4 Wheat 316 (1819) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Such a provision our Constitution-makers did make. 73. Item 97 corresponds to the residuary legislative powers of Parlia- ment under Article 248. It reads as follows : 97. Any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those lists. It gives effect to Article 248. No doubt, resort to Article 248, read with Item 97 of List I, could not overcome any specific constitutional bar against legislation on investigation of conduct of Ministers of any State Government in the discharge of their duties had there been one. There is certainly no such express and specific bar in our Constitution. And, it is difficult to see how one can arise by some necessary implication of provisions dealing with entirely different topics. There is no indication anywhere in our Constitution that, while enacting the provisions from which we are asked to infer a bar against or limitation upon legislation on such a topic as inquiries, that our Constitution-makers had any such bar or limitation even remotely in their minds. There seems no legal or rational nexus between such a supposed bar or limitation and the subjects dealt with in the articles relied upon. As already indicated above, the Constitution-makers cannot always mention and Pxhaust every conceivable topic. l think that it is in order to meet precisely such a situation that Article 248 read with Entry 97 was inserted. Hence, I think that Article 248 read with Entry 97 of List I will fully cover Section 3 of the Act even if Item 94 of List I does not. 74. Alternatively, Entry 45 of the Concurrent Schedule was relied upon on behalf of the Union. follows: List III of Seventh This item reads as 45. Inquiries and statistics for the purposes of any of the matters. specified in List II or List Ill. To fall under I tern 45 of List III the topic of inquiry must relate to one of the entries specified in List II or List III. If neither Items 94 and 97 of List I nor Item 45 of List III which refers to inquiries relating to topics in List 11 as well, could cover Section 3 of the Act, it would necessarily follow that such an enactment, assuming that Section 3 was meant to cover an inquiry against a State Minister's conduct in the exercise of powers enjoyed by him by virtue of his office, was not contemplated at all by our Constitution-makers. If such an argument was correct, Section 3 would, on the assumption made, fall entirely outside the legislative competence of both Parliament and State Legislatures because there would be no legislative power conferred upon any Legislature to deal with such a subject as it could not be covered by any entry in any list. Indeed, if we have correctly understood the argument of learned Counsel for the plaintiff in the form it finally took, this is precisely what is submitted to us for acceptance. It was contended that this was so because the conduct of governmental affairs by State Governments and their Ministers is subject exclusively to the control by State Legislature and those of the Union Government by Parliament alone by reason of the constitutional provisions we have already examined and explained. 75. To accept such contentions of the learned Counsel for the plaintiff is to place Ministers, both in the States and in the Union Governments, completely outside the scope of legal answerability on the ground that they ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

UNION OP INDIA (Beg, C,J,) 661 were only politically responsible to and controllable by appropriate legislatures even when they, in the course of purported exercise of official powers, act dishonestly and co1 ruptly and even commit criminal off~nces. This would mean that even if a Minister receives bribes, as we genuinely hope that none in the whole country does, he could not be made answerable in ordinary courts or be subjected to criminal proceedings. If no inquiry under any law into his conduct was possible simply because the act complained of was done by a Minister in purported exercise of a power vested in him by virtue of his ministerial office, he wouid be placed in a privileged position above the ordinary processes of law applicable to other citizens. Mere holding of ministerial office would confer immunity from any inquiry. He would thus become a legally irresponsible despot above the ordinary law. 76. To determine whether there is a prima facie case for a criminal offence facts have td be necessarily investigated or inquired into. But, if every type of inquiry and investigation except one by the House of the Legislature of which he is a member is barred, the very first step towards a prosecution for any serious crime would be shut out in limine. No question of any further legal proceedings would arise under any enactment. Such a consequence of the constitutional provisions relied upon by learned Counsel for the plaintiff could not, in our opinion;· be possibly within the contempla- tion of our Constitution-makers. Indeed, such a view would clearly violate the express and very salutary provisions of Article 14. 77. We p refer to infer and hold that the term 'inquiries', as used in Item 94 of List I and Item 45 of List III, without any limitations upon their nature or specification of their character or objects, is wide enough to embrace every kind of inquiry, whether a criminal offence by anyone is disclosed or not by facts alleged . Entry 45 in List III must include inquiries to cover allegations against all persons which bring them within the sphere of Entry I of List III relating to criminal law. All that \"inquiries\" covered by Item 45 require is that they must be \"for the purpose of any of the matters specified in Li:.t II or List III\". The language used-\"any of the matters specified\"-is broad enough to cover anything reasonably related to any of the enumerakd items even if done by holders of ministerial offices in the States. Other subjects will be found in State List II. And, even assuming that neither Entry 94 of List I nor Entry 45 of List III, would cover inquiries against ministers in the States, relating to acts connected with the exercise of ministerial powers, we think that Article 248, read with Entry 97 of List I, must necessarily cover an inquiry against Ministers on matters of public importance whether the allegations include violations of criminal law or not. A contrary view would, in my opinion, have the wholly unacceptable consequence of placing Ministers in State Governments practically above the law. We must lean against an interpretation which has consequences which, had they flowed from an express enactment of Parliament or of a State Legislature, would have invalidated the provision for conflict with Article 14. 78 . It would not be out of place to mention that even for the purposes of an inquiry into the conduct of Judges of the Supreme Court or of High Courts an Act of Parliament was passed for the specific purposes of Article 124 to provide, through appropriate investigation and inquiry, \"proof of the misbehaviour o~ incapacity of a Judge\" before proceedings under Article 124(4) could be initiated for tht>ir removal. [See: The Judges' (Inquiry) Act 51 of 1968) .

It is true that, as somebody has observed, reckless charges are perhaps hurled against tho!;e holding public offices in our country with the abundance of confetti at a wedding, yet, we cannot do away with inquiries under the Act for this reason. The liability to face such inquiries before a duly appointed impartial Commission is one of those hazards which individuals holding ministerial office have to face. They can perhaps find solace in the thought that inquiries which are thorough and impartial, conducted by competent persons who have held high judicial office, are the best means of clearing them of charges which are really unfounded and malicious. 79. As we think that the powers conferred by Section 3 upon the Central and State Governments, including the power to institute inquiries of the kind set up under each of the two notifications, are covered by the express constitutional provisions mentioned above, no question of any exclusion, either by necessary implication or by any principle supposed to form a part of or to flow from the basic structure of the Constitution, can arise here. Nor can we, upon the view we take, read down and so interpret Section 3 of the Act as to exclude from its purview inquiries of the kind instituted under the two notifications. To do s-o would be to give an incentive to possible misuse and perversion of governmental machinery and powers for objects not warranted by law. Such powers carry constuutional obligations with them. They are to be exercised like the powers and obligations of trustees who must not deviate from the purposes of their trusts. Whether a Minister has or, has not abused his powers and privileges could be best determined by fair and honest people anywhere only after a just and impartial inquiry has taken place into complaints made against him so that its results are before them. 80. It is evident from the foregoing discussion that the principle relied upon by the plaintiff's learned Counsel repeatedly, in support of which a passage from Crawford' s \"Statutory Construction\" ( 1940 Edn.) (Paragraph 195 at pp. 334-335) was also cited, as the basis of the submissions of the learned Counsel, was that what is expressly provided for by the Constitution must necessarily exclude what is not so provided for. This reasoning is an attempted misapplication of the principle of construction \"Expressio Unius Esl Exclusio Alterius\". Before the principle can be applied at all the Court must find an express mode of doing something that is provided in a statute, which, by its necessary implication, could exclude the doing of that very thing and not something else in some other way. Far from this being the case here, as the discussion above has shown, the Constitution-makers intended to cover the making of provisions by Parliament for inquiries for various objects which may be matters of public importance without any indications of any other limits except that they must relate to subjects found in the Lists. I have also indicated why a provision like Section 3 of the Act would, in any case, fall under Entry 97 of List I of Schedule VIl read with Articles 248 and 356 of the Constitution even if all subjects to which it may relate are not found specified in the lists. Thus, there is express provision in our Consti- tution to cover an enactment such as Section 3 of the Act. Hence, there is no room whatsoever for applying the \"Expressio Urzius\" rule to exclude what falls within an expressly provided legislative entry. That maxim has been aptly described as a \"useful servant but a dangerous master\" (per Lopes L. J. in Colquboun v. Brooks'). The limitations or conditions under which 4.

To advance the balder and broader proposition that what is not specifically mentioned in the Constitutioa. must be deemed to be deliberately excluded from its purview, so that nothing short of a constitutionaJ amend- ment could authorise legislation upon it, is really to invent a \"Casus Omissus\" so as to apply the rule that, where there is such a gap in the law, the Court cannot fill it. The rule, however, is equally clear that the Court cannot so interpret a statute as ''to produce a casus omissus\" where there is really none (see: The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Henderson Brothers). 1 . If our Con- stitution itself provides for legislation to fill what is sought to be construed as a lacuna how can legislation seeking to do this be held to be void because it performs its intended function by an exercise of an expressly conferred legislative power? In declaring the purpose of the provisions so made and the authority for making it, Courts do not supply an omission or fill up a gap at all. It is Parliament which can do so and has done it. To hold that Parliament is incompetent to do this is to substitute an indefensible theory or a figment of one's imagination-that the Constitution stands in the way somehow-for that wuich only a clear constitutional bar could achieve. 82. This brings me to the next question to be considered : are there any special rules relating to the construction of Constitutions in general or of our Constitution in particular? And, if there be any such rules, would their application support the restrictive construction, submitted on behalf of the plaintiff for our acceptance, on the Parliament's power to enact Section 3 of the Act? These seem to be important questions which need answers with some clarity if possible. 83. A written Constitution, like any other enactment, is embodied in a document. Th ere are certain general rules of interpretation and construc- tion of all documents which, no doubt, apply to the Constitution as well. Nevertheless, the naturr of a Constitution of a sovereign Republic, which is meant to endure and stand the test of time, the strains and stresses of chang- ing circumstances, to govern the exercise of all governmental powers, conti- nuously, and to determine the destiny of a nation, could be said to require a special approach so that judicial intervention does not unduly thwart the march of the nation towards the goals it has set before itself. 84. Napoleon Bonaparte once said that the best Constitution for any country is one which is both short and vague. Obviously, he meant that a Constitution must have the capacity to develop and to be easily adapted to the changing needs of the nation, to the vicissitudes of its fortunes, to the growth and expansion of various spheres of its life-social, economic, politi- cal, legal, cultural, and psychological. If the Constitution is unable to per- form this function it fails. Prof. Willis, whose work on \"Constitutional Law of th, United States\" has been cited before by this Court, has said (at p. 19): Our original Constitution was not an anchor but a rudder. The Constitution of one period has not been the Constitution of another period. As one period has succeeded another, the Constitution has be- come larger and larger. This elasticity ur adaptability of the American Constitution may account for its durability. 85. Although, a written Constitution, which is always embodied in a 5.

This approach seems to flow from what may be called a basic principle of construction of documents of this type : that the paramount or predominant objects and purposes, evident from the contents, must prevail over lesser ones obscurely embedded here and there. The Constitutional document, in other words, mu,t be read as a whole and construed in keeping with its declared objects and its functions. The dynamic needs of the nation, which a Constit,ution must fulfil, leave no room for merely pedantic hairsplitting play with words or semantic quibblings. This, however, does not mean that the Courts, acting under the guise of a judicial power, which certainly extends to even making the Constitution, in the sense that they may supplement it in those parts of it where the letter pf the Constitution is silent or may leave room for its development by either ordinary legislation or judicial interpretation, can actually nullify, defeat, or distort the reasonably clear meaning of any part of the Constitution in order to give expression to some theories of their own about the broad or ba'.iic scheme of the Constitution. 86. The theory behind the Constitution which can be taken into account for purposes of interpretation, by going even so far as to fill what have been called the \"interstices\" or spaces left unfilled, due perhaps to some deliberate vagueness or indefiniteness in the letter of the Constitution, must itself be gathered from express provisions of the Constitution. The dubiousness of expressions used may be cured by Courts by making their meanings clear and definite if necessary in the light of the broad and basic purposes set before themselves by the Constitution-makers. And, these meanings may, in keeping with the objectives or ends which the Constitu- tion of every nation must serve, change with changing requirements of the times. The power of judicial interpretation, even if it includes what. may be termed as \"intersticial\" law making, cannot extend to direct conflict with express provisions of the Constitution or to ruling them out of existence. What the express provisions authorise cannot be curtailed by importing limits based on a mere theory of limitations on legislative powers. 87, The statement of general principles of construction set out above, is borne out by earlier pronouncements of this Court-some emphasizing the clearly expressed meanings of words used in the Constitution, which cannot be deviated from, others laying stress on the paramount purposes and objec- tives of the Constitution-makers, some asserting the undoubted power of Courts to declare void legislation in conflict with the constitutional provi- sions, others pointing out the plenitude of legislative powers conferred by the Constitution upon Parliament and the State Legislatures, presumed to know best the needs of the people, so that Courts could not lightly invalidate statutes. I will briefly refer to some of the past pronouncements of this Court where emphasis would naturally differ from case to case according to the particular context in which some rule of construction arose for consi- deration. 88. Kania, C. J., quite clearly laid down a basically sound approach, if I may so characterise it with great respect, to the interpretation of the Constitution in A. K. Gopalan v.

Th, Commonwealth of Australia7 observed that \"a Constitution must not be construed in any narrow and pedantic sense\". Mr. Justice Higgins in Attorney-General of New South Wales v. Brewery Employees' Unio~ observed: \"Although we are to interpret WC\\l'ds of the Constitution on the same principles of interpretation as we apply to any ordinary law, these very principles of interpretation compel us to take into account the nature and scope of the Act that we are interpreting-to remember that it is a Constitution, a mechanism under which laws are to be made and not a mere Act which declares what the law is to be\". In In re the Cen- tral ProrJinces and Berar Act XIV of 19388 , Sir Maurice Gwyer, C. J., after adopting these observations said : \"especially is this true of a Federal Constitution with its nice balance of jurisdictions. I conceive that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret it; but I do not imply by this that they are free to stretch or pervert legal or constitutional theory or even for the purpose of supplying omis- sions or of correcting supposed errors\". There is considerable authority for the statement that the Courts are not at liberty to declare an Act void because in their opinion. it is opposed to a spirit supposed to pervade the Constitution but not expressed in words. Where the fundamental law has not limited, either in terms or by necessary implication, the general powers conferred upon the Legislature, we cannot declare a limi- tation under the notion of having discovered something in the spirit of the Constit\\ltion which is not even mentioned in the instrument. It is difficult upon any general principles to limit the omnipoten·ce of the sovereign legislative power by judicial interposition, except so far as the express words of a written Constitution give that authority. It is also stated, if the words be positive and without ambiguity, there is no authority for a Court to vacate or repeal a Statute on that ground alone. But, it is only in express constitutional provisions limiting legislative power and controlling the temporary will of a majority by a permanent and paramount law settled by the deliberate wisdom of the nation that one can find a safe and solid ground for the authority of Courts of justice to declare void any legislative enactment. Any assumption of authority beyond this would be to place in the hands of the judiciary powers too great and too indefinite either for its own security or the protection of private rights. 89. In State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh10, this Court held that where two constructions are possible, \"the Court should adopt that which will im- plement and discard that which will stultify the apparent intention of the makers of the Constitution\". 90. Another principle which this Court has repeatedly laid down, for cases in which two constructions may be reasonably possible, is that it should adopt one which harmonizes rather than one which produces a conflict bet- ween constitutional provisions (see: I.

Courts have been advised to adopt the construction \"which will ensure smooth and harmonious working of the Constitution and eschew the other which will lead to absurdity or give rise to practical inconvenience or make well-established provisions of existing law nugatory\" (See : Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala''). 9~ In Kesavananda Bharati's case Sikri C. J., said about the mode of construing tlw Constitution : One must not construe it as an ordinary statute. The Constitution, apart from setting up a machinery for Government, has a noble and grand vision in the Preamble. 93. In that very case Khanna, J. observed : A Constitution cannot be regarded as a mere legal document to be read ac; a will or an agreement nor is Constitution like a plaint or a written statement tiled in a suit between too litigants. It provides for the framework of the different organs of the State, viz. the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. A Constitution also reflects the hopes and aspirations of a people. 94. Repeatedly, this Court has declared that a broad and liberal cons- truction in keeping with the purposes of a Constitution must be given pre- ference over adherence to too literal an interpretation (see: e.g. Sakal Pap,rs (P) Ltd. v.

In particular, the plenitude of power to legislate, indicated by a legislative entry, has to be given as wide and liberal an interpretation as is reasonably possible.

P. 18, this Court said: .. .it is an elementary cardinal rule of interpretation that the words used in the Constitution which confer legislative power must receive the most liberal construction and if they are words of wide amplitude, they must be interpr et e d so as to give effect to that amplitude. It would be out of place to put a narrow or restricted construction on words of wide amplitude in a Constitution. A general word used in an entry like the present one must be construed to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be held to be included in it. 96.

These words really refer to the matters contained in each of the Entries I to 96. The words \"any othl'T matter\" had to be used because Entry 97 List I follows Entries 1-96 List I. It is true that the field of legislation is demarcated by Entri E'S 1-96 List I, but demarcation does not mean that if Entry 97 List I confers additional powers we should refuse to give effect to it. At any rate, whatever doubt there may be on the interpretation of Entry 97 List I is removed by the. wide terms of Article 248. It is framed in the widest possible terms. On its terms the only question to be asked is: Is the matter sought to be legislated on included in List II or in List III or is the tax sought to be levied mentioned in List II or in List III? No question has to be asked about List I. If the answer is in the nPgative, then it follows that Par- liament has power to make Laws with respect to that matter of tax. 97. It will be seen that the test adopted in Dhillon' s case was that if a subject does not fall within a specifically d emarcated field found in List II or List 111 it would fall in List I apparently because of the amplitude of the residuary field indicated by Entry 97, List I. Legislative entries only denote fields of operation of legislative power which is actually conferred by one of the articles of the Constitution. It was pointed out that Article 248 of the Constitution conferring legislative power is \"framed in the widest possible terms\". The validity of the Wealth Tax Act was upheld in that case. The argument that a wide range given to Entry 97 of List I, read with Article 248 of the Constitution, would destroy the \"federal structure\" of our Republic was rejected there. On an application of a similar test here, the powers given to the Central Government by Section 3 of the Act, now before us, could not be held to be invalid on the ground that the federal structure of the State is jeopardized by the view we are adopting in conformity with the previous decisions of this Court. 98. I may next refer to what may be regarded as certain special features of our Constitution so as to indicate its broad purposes and objectives. 99. Our Constitution has, in it, not only an elevating preamble setting forth the presumed will of the whole people of India, conceived of as one entity, but a set of Fundamental Rights in Part III, Directive Principles of State Policy in Part IV of the Constitution, a rough separation of powers between the Executive, the L egislative, and the judicial branches of Govern- ment, a pragmatic federalism which, while distributing legislative powers between the Parliament and State Legislatures, with a concurrent iield also, and indicating the spheres of governmental powers of State and Central Governments, is overlaid, as already indicated above, by drongly 'unitary' features, particularly exhibited by lodging in Parliament the residuary legislative powers, and in the Central Government the executive power of appointing State Governors, and Chief Justices and Judges of High Courts, powers of giving appropriate directions to the State Governments, and of even displacing the State Legislatures and Governments in exceptional cir- cumstances or emergencies of not very clearly defined ambits or characters. No other \"federation\" in th e world has exactly similar unitary features. One wonders whether such a system is entitled to be dubbed \"federal\" in a sense denoting anything more than a merely convenient division of functions operative in ordina1 y times. The function of ''supervision\" is certainly that of the Central Government with all that it implies. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It may be noticed that the basic allegiance contemplated by the Constitution is, legally speaking, to the Constitution itself about whose advent this Court once said (in Virendra Singh v. The State of U. P. 11). . . . at one moment of time the new order was born with the new allegiance springing from the same source for all, grounded on the same · basis: the sovereign will of the people of India with no class, no caste, no race, no creed, no distinction, no reservation. 101. The Constitution, as its Preamble makes it clear, is of a sovereign republic. The legal sovereignty which it represents includes legal legislative sovereignty which must embrace the power of making any law on any subject. Such legislative power to enact any law must, therefore, vest some- where in a legislative organ of the Republic. It cannot be placed anywhere outside these organs. To .apply the t~st formulated in Dhillon's case (supra) the Parliament alone would have the power to enact by a simple majority, by reason of Article 248 re.ad with Entry 97 of List I, if it falls neither in List II nor in List III. As indicated above, the contention on behalf of the plaintiff, if accepted, would expel the power of legislation itself on any matter involving an inquiry into the conduct of governmental affairs by a Minister in a State Government from the legislative Lists and place it under Article 368. This means that, although the express provisions of the Cons- titution, broadly interpreted, as they should be, would prima facie authorise a provision such as Section 3 of the Act, yet, we should imply a constitutional prohibition against such on enactment by Pc1rliament even if its wide terms could, as they prima facie do, include inquirias against State Ministers exercising governmental powers. 102. As indicated above, the first step of the argument mentioned above is a theory of what the Constitution must necessarily contain as con- trasted with ordinary law. To support this submission, a passage was cited from the judgment of Wanchoo, J., in J.C. Golaknathv. State of Punjabn which contains the following question from Ivor Jennings on \"The Law and the Constitution\" (1933 Edn. at p. 51 onwards): A written Constitution is thus the fundamental law of a country• the express embodiment of the doctrine of the reign of law . All public authorities-legislative, administrative and judicial-take their powers directly or indirectly from it ... whatever the nature of the written Cons- titution it is clear that there is a fundamental distinction between cons- titutional law and the rest of the law. . . There is a clear separation, therefore, between the constitutional law and the rest of the law. The learned Judge then went on to observe: It is because of this difference between the fundamental law (namely, the Constitution) and the law passed under the legislative pro- visions of the Constitution that it is not possible in the absence of an express provision to that effect in the fundamental law to change the fundamental law by ordinary legislation passed thereunder, for such ordinary legislation must always conform to the fundamental law (i. e. the Constitution). In Golaknath's case, Wanchoo, J. had also pointed out at page 827: The Constitution is the fundamental law and no law passed under mere legislative power conferred by the Constitution can affect any 21.

But subject to such express power given by the Constitution itself, the fundamental law, namely the Constitution, cannot be changed by a law passed under the legislative provisions con- tained in the Constitution as all legislative acts passed under the power conferred by the Contitution must conform to the Constitution and can make no change therein. There are a number of articles in the Cons- titution, which expressly provide for amendment by law, as, for exam- ple, 3, 4, 10, 59(3), 65(3), 73(2), 97, 98(3), 106, 120(2), 135, 137, 142(1), 146(2), H8(3), 149, 169, 171(2), 186, 187(3), 189(3), 194(3), 195, 210(2), 221(2), 225, 229(2), 239(1), 241(3), 283(1) and(~), 285(2), 287, 300(1), 313,345,373, ScheduleV, Clause 7andScheduleVI, Clause 2 l ; and so far as these articles are concerned they can be amended by Parliament by ordinary law-making process. But so· far as the other afticles are concerned they can only be amended by amendment of the Constitution under Article 368. Now Article 245 which gives power to make law for the whole or any part of the territory of India by Parlia- ment is \"subject to the provisions of this Constitution\" and any law made by Parliament whether under Article 246 read with List I or under Article 248 read with Item 97 of List l must be subject to the provisions of the Constitution. If therefore the power to amend the Constitution is contained in Article 248 read with Item 97 of List I, that power has to be exercised subject to the provisions of the Constitution and cannot be used to change the fundamental law (namely, the Constitution) itself. 103. The passages cited above cannot provide a foundation for the theory that \"constitutional law\" and the rest of the law can, in respect of their contents or subject-matter, be placed in two sharply divided or distinct and water-tight compartments with no overlapping or uncertain fields bet- ween them. It must not be forgotten that Wanchoo, J. repeatedly explained, by putting in the words \"namely, the Constitution\" within brackets, that he was really concerned with indicating the special features of a very detailed or comprehensive Constitution such as ours. Indeed, as regards the subject matter of the laws contained in the Constitution and those which may be introduced by the ordinary law making procedure, the above mentioned judgment of Wanchoo, J. itself indicates how even certain parts of the law found in our written Constitution may be amended by the ordinary law making procedure. This passage was used by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff to urge that additions or changes in \"Constitutional Law\" cannot be made by ordinary law making procedure but must take place only in accordance with the provisions found in Article 368 unless the Constitution expressly provides otherwise. This contention, however, overlooks the fact that Article 368 of the Constitution only provides the procedure for an amendment of '·the Constitution\", and says nothing about any amendment of other laws by the introduction of or changes in laws which may concei- vably be classed or construed as \"constitutional laws\" because of their sub- ject matter. This passage should not be torn out of its context, in which the difference in procedure, between the one for an amendment of \"the Constitution\", provided by Article 368, and that for ordinary legislation, contemplated by Articles 245 to 248, was under consideration. It was in that connection that the observation was rightly made that, unless there is specific authority given by constitutional provisions for changing the law laid down by \"the Constitution\" itself, by adopting only the ordinary law making procedure, a change in the law contained in express provisions of \"the Constitution\" itself could not be brought about without complying ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

This follows obviously from the very notion of a Constitution as an embodiment of a \"fundamental law\" which serves as a touchstone for all other \"laws\". The \"fundamental distinction\" between \"the constitutional law\" or \"the fundamental law\" and the ordi- nary laws, referred to there, was meant to bring out only this difference in the uses made of laws which, being ''fundamental\", can test the validity of all other laws on a lower normative level and these other laws which are so tested. In that very special or restricted sense, the law not found in \"the Constitution\" could not be \"constitutional,\" or \"fundamental\" law. Other parts or the law, even though they may appertain to important constitutional matters, are not parts of ''the Constitution\", and, therefore, could nQt test the validity of laws made by Parliament. What was said with reference to the a<.,.tual provisions of the Constitution could not, however, be used to infer some bar on legislative power which is not there in the Constitution at all for reasons repeatedly indicated above. 104. In an earlier part of thi5 judgment, it is held that legislative power to enact a provision such as Section 3 of the Act could be found, in any event, in Article 248 read with Entry 97 of List I, even if it could possibly be urged that it is not covered by Entries 94 of List I and 45 of List [II, which seem to exhaust the three lists in so far as the subject matters of inquiries are concerned. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff tried to introduce wme doubts on the ground that there is no specific entry in any of the lists to cover the conduct of Ministers in State Governments in relation to governmental functions. And, it was submitted, reference to subjects specified in the lists would exclude those which are unspecified. It could be urged in reply that, as indicated in Dhillon' s case (supra), a legislative entry only indicates the field of operation of the power, but the sources of ordinary legislative power are to be found in one of the Articles 245, 246, 24 7, 248, 249, 250, 252 or 253 of the Constitution, and so far as the field of operation of the legislative power is concerned, both Entry 94 of List I and Entry 45 of List III are so widely worded as to embracP inquiriPs touching any of the fields indicated by any of the entries in thP lists. A Minister must necessarily exercise governmental powers in relation to onP of the these fields. It is not necessary to specify which that field is. The field of power to legislate about inquiries is indicated in wide f'nough tPrms to make it unnecessary to specify the field, in the law made itself, to which the inquiry must relate. It is enough if the enquiry set up relates to a matter of \"public importance\". Again, it is not a necessary part of an entry in a legislative list, which only roughly indicates a field of legislation, that it must al-,o specify the classes of persons who may be affected by the legislation. That is neither a constitutional nor a reasonable requirement. 105. This Court has already held that overlapping of fields of operation of legislative power does not take away the legislative power. Indeed, as we have said, both Entrif's 94 of List I and 45 of List Ill must necessarily be related to a variPty of fields of operation of legislative power. And, in any case even if an inquiry on a matter of \"public importance\" relates to an unspecified field, it should be covered by Entry 97 of List I itself. Therefore, it is immaterial whether we hold that Entry 97 of List I by itself singly or that entry, read with Entry 94 of List I, could be deemed to cover the field of operation of such legislation. What is material and important is that the three Entries-94 and 97 of List I and 45 of List III are bound to cover between them, legislation authorising inquiries such as the one entrusted t~ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

If the subject of inquiries against Ministers in State Governments is not mentioned specifically either in any of the articles of the Constitution or in the legislative lists it does not follow from it that legislation covering such inquiries is incompetent except by means of a constitutional amendment. On the contrary, such a subject would be prima facie covered by the wide terms of Article 21-8 for the very reason that the Constitution contains no express or implied bar which could curtail the presumably plenary powers of legislation of our Parliament. 106. Once we have located the legislative power in one of the articles of the Constitution, authorising ordinary legislation by Parliament for inqui- ries covered by Section 3 of the Act, and we find also the appropriate entries in legislative Lists I and III indicating the fields of operation of that legislative power of Parliament, the well recognised principle which would apply and exclude an implied bar against the exercise of that plenary power has been stated by this Court and also by other Courts in Commonwealth countries on several occasions. That principle follows logically from R. v. Burah13 which is the locus classicus on the subject. The general principle laid down in Burak' s case was that once what is conferred upon a Parliament or other Legislature is legislative power, its plenary character must be presumed so that, unless the instrument conferring the power to legislate itself contains some express limitation on the exercise of legislative power, the ambit of that power cannot be indirectly cut down by supposed implications. The cases on this subject were comprehensively considered by this Court in Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra} where the majority view was that there can be no merely implied limitations on expressly conferred legislative powers. This Court there referred to and adopted the principles laid down in Burah's case. Palekar, J. quoted the following passage from it (in Kesavananda Bharati's case at p. 607) (SCC p. 707} : The established Courts of Justice, when a question arises whether the prescribed limits have been exceeded, must of necessity determine that question; and the only way in which they can properly do so, is by looking to the terms of the instrument by which, affirmatively, the legislative powers were created, and by which, negatively, they are restricted. If what has been done is legislation, within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power, and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited it is not for any Court of Justice to inquire further, or to enlarge constructively those conditions and restrictions. In that case, Judges of this Court also relied upon Attorney-General for the Province of Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion of CanadaH where Earl Loreburn had said (at p. 583) : In the interpretation of a completely self-governing Constitution founded upon a written organic instrument such as the British North America Act, if the text is explicit the text is conclusive, alike in what it directs and what it forbids. When the text is ambiguous, as for example, when the words establishing two mutually exclusive jurisdictions are wide enough to bring a particular power within either, recourse must be had to the context and scheme of the Act. 107.

Barwick, C. J., also cited the following passage from the Amalgamated Society of Engineers v. Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd. 18 : 'The nature and principles of legislation' (to employ the words of Lord Selborne in Burah's cas,), the nature of dominion self-government and the decisions just cited entirely preclude, in our opinion, an a priori contention that the grant of legislative power to the Commonwealth Parliament as representing the will of the whole of the people of all the State of Australia should not bind within the geographical area bf the Commonwealth and within the limits of the enumerated powers, ascer- tained by the ordinary process of construction, the States and their agencies as representing separate sections of the territory. 108. In Victoria's case ~supra), Barwick, C. J., although not in entire agreement with the way in which Sir Owen Dixon, C. J., had expressed himself in West v. CommisJioner of Taxation (N. S. W.) 11 opined that it was only another way of putting what had been consistently laid down as the principle of interpretation of Constitutions of British self-governing Dominions since Burah' s case. The passage thus explained was : ... the principle is that whenever the Constitution confers a power to make laws in respect of a specific subject matter prima facie it is to be understood as enabling the Parliament to make laws affecting the operations of the States and their agencies. The prima facie meaning may be displaced by considerations based on the nature or the subject matter of the power or the language in which it is conferred or on some other provision in the Constitution. 109. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff, conscious of the basic principles of construction of the plenary constitutional power to legislate, tried to sustain his very gallant attacks upon the validity of Section 3 of the A:ct by referring to express provisions of the Constitution where, as we have explained above, we coqld discover no such bar by a necessary implication. However, the theory of the basic structure of the Constitution kept \"popping up\", if we may so put it, like the \"jack in the box\", from behind the constitutional provisions, from time to time. It was said to \"underlie\" constitutional provisions. 110. Thus, the plaintiff's learned Counsel did not entirely give up reliance on what has been described as ''the basic structure of the Constitu- tion•• although he, very astutely and rightly, tried to put the express provisions of the Constitution in the forefront. Whatever may be said about the strategic value for the plaintiff of this mode of using the doctrine of \"the basic structure of the Constitution\", it does not relieve us from the necessity of considering whether an application of such a doctrine could be involved in the case before us. We cannot overlook that Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra) where, although, a majority of learned Judges of this Court rejected the theory of \"implied limitations\" upon express plenary legislative powers of constitutional amendment, yet, we accepted, I say so with the utmost respect, again by a majority, limitations which appeared to be not easily distinguishable from implied limitations upon plenary legislative powers even though they were classed as parts of '' the basic 26.

We are bound by the majority view in Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra) which we have followed in other cases. We have, however, to make it clear and explicit enough to be able to determine, without inconsistency and with some confidence, the type of cases to which it could and others to which it could not apply as specific cases come up before us for consideration. 111. What, therefore, is this doctrine of \"the basic structure of our Constitution\" of which, according to some leclrned Judges of this Court, expressing the majority views on this doctrine, \"federalism,, is a part? We can only answer this question by quoting from certain passages from the opinions of the learned Judges who were parties to the decision of this Court in Kesavana.nda Bharati's case (supra). 112. Sikri, C. J., who accepted the doctrine of implied limitations, and, consistently with its logic, found that the basic structure of the Cons- titution forms an orbit of exercise of power which is outside the purview of Article 368, relied on the observations and dicta found in Melbourne Corporation v. The Commonwealth• and Au.slralian National .Airways Pol. Lid. v. Tiu Commonwealth\". 113. The learned Chief Justice cited Starke, J.'s views expressed in Melbourne Corporation's case : The federal character of the Australian Constitution carries impli- cations of its own .•.• The position that I take is this: The several subject matters with respect to which the Commonwealth is empowered by the Constitution to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth are not to be narrowed or limited by implication. Their scope and amplitude depend simply on the words by which they are expressed. But implications arising from the existence of the States as parts of the Commonwealth and as consti- tuents of the federation may restrict the manner in which the Parlia- ment can lawfully exercise its power to make laws with respect to a particular subject-matter. These implications, or perhaps it were better to say underlying assumptions of the Constitution, relate to the use of a power not to the inherent nature of the subject-matter of the law. Of course whether or not a law promotes peace, order and good government is for the Parliament, not for a Court, to decide. But a law although it be with respect to a designated subject-matter, cannot be for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth if it be directed to the States to prevent their carrying out their functions as parts of the Commonwealth. Again Gibbs, J. was quoted: The ordinary principles of statutory construction do not preclude the making of implications when these are necessary to give effect to the intention of the legislature as revealed in the statute as a whole .•. . . . Thus, the purpose of the Constitution, and the scheme by which it is intended to be given effect, necessarily give rise to implica- tions as to the manner in which the Commonwealth and the States respectively may exercise their powers, vis-a-vis each other. After considering a number of cases the Chief Justice stated his conclusion on implied limitations as follows (at pp. 163-164) {SCC pp. 364-65): 28. (1947) 74 CLR 31 _ 29.

It was the common understanding that fundamental rights would remain in substance as they are and they would not be amended out of existence. It seems also to have been a common understanding that the fundamental features of the Constitution, namely, secularism, democracy and the freedom of the individual would always subsist in the welfare state. In view of the above reasons, a necessary implication arises that there are implied limitations on the power of Parliament that the expression \"amendment of this Constitution\" has consequently a limited meaning in our Constitution and not the meaning suggested by the respondents. 114. Sikri, C. J. recorded his finding on the basic structure in Kesava- nanda Bharati's case (supra) as follows (at pp. 165-166) (SCC p. 366): The true position is that every provision of the Constitutiol'l can be amended orovided in the result the basic foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the same. The basic structure may be said to consi~t of the following features: (1) Supremacy of the Constitution; (2) Republican ~nd Democratic form of Government; (3) Secular character of the Constitution; (4) Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary ; · (5) Federal character of the Constitution. The above structure is built on the basic foundation, i. e. the dignity and freedom of the individual. This is of supreme importance. This cannot by any form of amendment be destroyed. The above foundation and the above basic features are easily discernible not only from the Preamble but the whole scheme of the Constitution, which I have already discussed. 115. Similarly, Shelat and Grover, JJ., after surveying principles of interpretation and construction of the Constitution, accepted the theory of implied limitations on the power of Parliament as well as doctrine of a basic structure. They recorded their conclusion as follows (at pp. 280-281) (SCC p. 454) : The basic structure of the Constitution is not a vague concept and the apprehensions expressed on behalf of the respondent;s that neither the citizen nor the Parliament would be able to understand it are unfounded.

They distinguished earlier cases of this Court. They purported to apply well established principles of interpretation and construction such as the Mischief Rule in Heydon's cast, the need to view the Constitution as a whole, and its history and objects. They said (at p. 307)(SCC p. 475) : While interpreting a provision in a statute or Constitution the primary duty of the Court is to find out the legislative intent. In the present case our duty is to find out the intention of the founding fathers in enacting Article 368. Ordinarily the legislative intent is gathered from the language used. If the language employed is plain and unambiguous, the same must be given effect to irrespective of the consequences that may arise. But if the language employed is reasonably capable of more meanings than one, then the Court will have to call into aid various well settled rules of construction and•in particular, the history of the legislation-to find out the evil that was sought to be remedied and also in some cases the underlying purpose of the legislation -the legislative scheme and . the consequences that may possibly flow from accepting one or the other of the interpretations because no legislative body is presumed to confer a power which is capable of misuse. They cited the Preamble and the objectives underlying the Constitution and found (at p. 316) (SCC p. 482) : Implied limitations on the powers conferred under a statute consti- tute a general feature of all statutes. The position cannot be different in the case of powers conferred under a Constitution. A grant of power in general terms or even in absolute terms may be qualified by other express provisions in the same enactment or may be qualified by the implications of the context or even by considerations arising out of what appears to be the general scheme of the statute. They did not enumerate all the basic features of the Constitution but recorded their conclusion as follows (at p. 356) (SCC p . 512) : Though the power to amend the Constitution under Article 368 is a very wide power, it does not yet include the power to destroy or emasculate the basic elements or the fundamental features of the Cons- titution. 117.

He said (at p. 517) (SCC p. 637) : There is nothing vague or unascertainable in the Preamble and if what is stated therein is subject to this criticism it would be equally true of what is stated in Article 39(6} and (c) as these are also objectives fundamental in the governance of the country which the State is enjo'ined to achieve for the amelioration and happiness of its people. The elements of the basic structure are indicated in the Preamble and translated in the various provisions of the Constitution. The edifice of our Constitution is built upon and stands on several props, remove any of them, the Constitution collapses. These are : ( l) Sovereign Democratic Republic; (2) Justice, social, economic and political; (3) Liberty of thoughJ:, expression, belief, faith and worship; (4) Equa- lity of status and of opportunity. Each one of these is important and collectively they assure a way of life to the people of India which the Constitution guarantees. To withdraw any of the above elements the structure will not survive and it will not be the same Constitution, or this Constitution, nor can it maintain its identity if something quite different is substituted in its place, which the sovereign will of the people alone can do. 118. Khanna, J., while definitely rejecting the theory of implied limitations on plenary powers of legislation, nevertheless, thought that the need to reconcile the urge for change with the need for continuity imposed even upon the wide power of amendment of the Constitution the limitation that it must move within the orbit defined by its basic structure. He did not, and I say so with great respect, explicitly attempt a reconci- liation between his views on implied limitations with those on the basic structure, which at least resembled implied limits on the plenary power of legislation. He aho relied heavily on the Preamble to the Constitution. He explained later, in Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain80 , that he did not exclude such amendments in the chapter on Fundamental Rights as may form parts of the \"basic structure\" from the purview of what could not be touched by the power of amendment contained in Article 368 of the Constitution. The judgment of Khanna, J., tilted the balance, by a narrow majority of one, in favour of the \"the basic structure\" of the Constitution as a limitation on the t!xpressly conferred legislative power of amendment. 119. I need not set out similarly the views of Ray, Palekar, Mathew, Beg, Dwivedi, and Chandrachud, JJ., as they, while accepting the undeniable proposition that the Constitution contained what was basic, held the view, supported also by reference to the history of our Constitution-making and to its express provisions, that power to amend or change the Constitution in any manner and in any respect desired by the representatives of the people was also a part of that basic structure or the urges of the people which had found expression in Article 368 of the Constitution and which had to be fully recognised by giving it the widest possible amplitude. They too, therefore, recognised that there was \"a basic structure\" of the Constitution in the light of its history and contents and by an application of well established rules of construction. The difference between the majority and minority views was only on the question whether a wide scope of powers of amend- 30.

UNION OP INDIA (Beg, C.J.) 677 ment given to the representatives of the people was or was not a part of this basic structure or its functioning as evidenced by the express declarations and provisions of the Constitution. 120. I do not think that those learned Judges who, in Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra), found a narrower orbit for the _legislative power of amendment of the Constitution itself to move in meant to lay down some theory of a vague basic structure floating, like a cloud in the skies, above the surface of the Constitution and outside it or one that lies buried beneath the surface for which we have to dig in order to discover it. I prefer to think that the doctrine of \"a basic structure\" was nothing more than a set of obvious inferences relating to the intents of the Constitution-makers arrived at by applying the established canons of construction rather broadly, as they should be so far as an organic constitutional document, meant to govern the fate of a nation, is concerned. But, in every case where reliance is placed upon it, in the course of an attack upon legislation, whether ordinary or constituent (in the sense that it is an amendment of the Constitution), what is put forward as part of \"a basic structure\" must be justified by references to the expresa provisions of the Constitution. That structure does not exist in vacuo. Inferences from it must be shewn to be embedded in and to flow logically and naturally from the bases of that structure. In other words, it must be related to the provisions of the Constitution and to the manner in which they could indubitably be presumed to naturally and reasonably function. So viewed, the doctrine is nothing more than a way of advancing a well recognised mode of construing the Constitution. It should be used with due care and caution. No exposition of it which could make it appear as a figment of judicial imagination or as capable of such subjective interpretations that it may become impossible to decipher or fix its meaning with reasonable certainty could be accepted by us because that would amount to declaring its futility. In Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra), this Court had not worked out the implications of the basic structure doctrine in all its applications. It could, therefore, be said, with utmost respect, that it was perhaps left there in an amorphous state which could give rise to possible misunderstandings as to whether it is not too vaguely stated or too loosely and variously formulated without attempting a basic uniformity of its meanings or implications. The one principle, however, which is deducible in all the applications of the basic structure doctrine, which has been used by this Court to limit even the power of constitutional amendment, is that whatever is put forward as a basic limitation upon legislative power must be co-related to one or more of the express provisions of the Constitution from which the limitation should naturally and necessarily spring forth. The doctrine of basic structure, as explained above, requires that any limitation on legislative power must be so definitely discernible from the provisions of the Constitution itself that there could be no doubt or mistake that the prohibition is a part of the basic structure imposing a limit on even the power of constitutional amend- ment. And, whenever we construe any document, by reading its provisions as a whole, trying to eliminate or resolve its disharmonies, do we not attempt to interpret it in accordance with what we find in its \"basic structure\" or purposes? The doctrine is neither unique nor new. 121. I may here point out that in Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Rqj Narain (supra), when the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution was invoked to assail the provisions of Representation of People Act, Ray, C.

He said (at pp. 436-437) (SCC p. 61): To accept the basic features or basic structures theory with regard to ordinary legislation would mean that there would be two kinds of limitations for legislative measures. One will pertain to legislative power under Articles. 245 and 246 and the legislative entries and the provision in Article 13. The other would be that no legislation can be made as to damage or destroy basic features or basic structures. This will mean rewriting the Constitution and robbing the Legislature of acting within the framework of the Constitution. No legislation can be free from challenge on this ground even though the legislative measure is within the plenary powers of the Legislature. He went on to observe (at p. 437) (SCC p. 61): The theory of basic structures or basic features is an exercise in imponderables. Basic structures or basic features are indefinable. The legislative entries are the fields of legislation. The pith and substance doctrine has been applied in order to find out legislative competency, and eliminate encroachment on legislative entries. If the theory of basic structures or basic features will be applied to legislative measures it will denude Parliament and State Legislatures of the power of legislation and deprive them of laying down legislative policies. This will be encroachment on the separation of powers. 122. Mathew, J., observed in Smt. Indira Gandhi's cast (supra) (at pp. 525-526) (SCC p. 138) : I think the inhibition to destroy or damage the basic structure by an amendment of the Constitution flows from the limitation OJ:\\ the power of amendment under Article 368 read into it by the majority in Bharati's cast (supra) because of their assumption that there are certain fundamental features in the Constitution which its makers intended to remain there in perpetuity. But I do not find any such inhibition so far as the power of Parliament or State legislatures to pass laws is concerned. Articles 245 and 246 give the power and also provide the limitation upon the power of these organs to pass laws. It is only the specific provisions enacted in the Constitution which could operate as limitation upon the power. The Preamble, though a part of the Constitution, is neither a source of power nor a limitation upon the power. The preamble sets out the ideological aspirations of the people. The essential features of the great concepts set out in the Preamble are delineated in the various provisions of the Constitution. It is these specific provisions in the body of the Constitution which determine the type of democracy which the founders of that instrument established; the quality and nature of justice, political, social and economic which was their consideration, the content of liberty of thought and expression which they entrenched in that document, the scope of equality of status and of opportunity which they enshrined in it. These specific provisions enacted in the Constitution alone can determine the basic structure of the Constitution as established. These specific provmons, either separately or in combination determine the content of the great concepts set out in the Preamble. It is impossible to spin out any concrete concept of basic structure out of the gossamer concepts set out in the Preamble. The specific provisions of the Constitution are the stuff from which the basic atructure has to be woven. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Indira Gandhi's case (supra), Chandrachud, J., after making similar observations on the nature of the Preamble and pointing out that there was no agreed list of basic features of the Constitution given by learned Judges constituting the majority in Kesavananda Bharati's cas, (supra), said, on the applicability of the basic structure doctrine to the power of ordinary legislation (at pp. 669-670) (SCC pp. 261-262): . The constitutional amendments may, on the ratio of the Fundamental Rights case, be tested on the anvil of basic structure. But apart from the principle that a case. is only an authority for what it decides, it does not logically follow from the majority judgment in the Fundamental Rights case that ordinary legislation must also answer the same test as a constitutional amendment. Ordinary laws have to answer two tests for their validity : (I) The law must be within the legislative competence of the Legislature as defined and specified in Chapter I, Part XI, of the Constitution and (2) it must not offend against the provisions of Article 13( l) and (2) of the Constitution. 'Basic structure', by the majority judgment, is not a part of the fundamental rights nor indeed a a provision of the Constitution. The theory of basic structure is woven out of the conspectus of the Constitution and the amending power is subject to it because it is a constituent power. 'The power to amend the fundamental instrument cannot carry with it the power to destroy its essential features' -this, in brief, in the arch of the theory of basic structure. It is wholly out of place in matters relating to the validity of ordinary laws made under the Constitution. 124. Both Khanna, J., and I, however, expressed views there showing that aspirations of the people of India, set out in the Preamble as well as other parts of the Constitution, provided general guidance in judging the constitutionality of all laws whether constitutional or ordinary. I specifically said there that the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution could be used to test the validity of laws made by Parliament either in its consti- tuent or ordinary law-making capacities because \"ordinary law-making cannot go beyond the I ange of constituent power\". 125. No doubt, as a set of inferences from a document (i.e. the Constitution), the doctrine of \"the basic structure\" arose out of and relates to the Constitution only and does not, in that sense, appertain to the sphere of ordinary statutes or arise for application to them in the same way. But, if, as a result of the doctrine, certain imperatives are inherent in or logically and necessarily flow from the Constitution's \"basic structure\", just as though they are its express mandates, they can be and have to be used to test the validity of ordinary laws just as other parts of the Constitution are so used. 126. In Smt. Indira Gandhi's case (supra), the differences of approach between the learned Judges were not so much on the question whether \"the basic structure\" was to be deemed to be really an additional part of the Constitution (on this there is agreement that it could not) or only a principle of its construction, but on the question whether, once it was found to be a permissible mode of construction, what followed from it was applicable to test the validity of both constitutional as well as ordinary law-making. The majority view of learned Judges of this Court seemed to be that, it was not available to test the validity of the impugned provisions of the Representation of People Act because the expressly laid down ordinary law-making powers of Parliament are clear enough. In other words, it was held to be in- applicable there on the view that there was no ambiguity to be resolved about ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It \\fas applied to interpret the ambit of the constituent power as there was some uncertainty about its scope. It, however, seems to me that the test of \"free and fair elections\" and of \"equality before the law\" were used by this Court in judging the validity of the impugned provisions of the Representation of People Act in Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi's case (supra) although the majority oflearned Judges of the Bench preferred to do so without characterising these features as parts of a basic structure of the Constitution. But, when deciding the question whether the purported constitutional amendment could take away the powers of this Court to hear and decide on merits the election appeals pending before it, all the learned Judges who participated in the decision of that case seemed to rely, in varying degrees, either expressly or impliedly, upon the \"basic structure\" of the Constitution itself, as revealed by its ex- press provisions, to hold that, under the guise of exercising a legislative power, the Parliament could not, in effect, adjudicate on the merits of an individual case under the Constitution as it stood. 127. It is important to note that majority opinions of Judges who participated in the decision in Kesavananda Bharati' s case (supra) and those who took part in the decision in Smt. Indira Gandhi's case (supra), invalidating certain constitutional amendments, make out limitations founded on the basic structure of the Constitution by very detailed references to the express provisions of the Constitution. In Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi's case (supra), parts of the Constitution (Thirty-Ninth Amendment) Act of 1975 were struck down primarily because specific provisions of Article 368 of the Constitution left no room for doubt that what was conferred by the Constitution upon a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of the two Houses of Parliament present and voting, supported by resolutions of Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States, was a legislative power and not a judicial power judged both by its contents and procedure. Hence, it was held that, on the very terms of the specific power conferred, an exercise of judicial power, in purported exercise of legislative powers contained in Article 368 of the Constitution, was prima facie ultra vires, Such exercise of power contravenes the basic structure of the Constitution of which the legislative orbit of power indicated by Article 368 of the Constitution is also a necessary part. The principle asserted there was stated by me as follows: Neither of the three constitutionally separate organs of State can, according to the basic scheme of our Constitution today, leap outside the boundaries of its own constitutionally assigned sphere or orbit of authority into that of the other. These orbits were expressly chalked out by the law found in the Constitution. There could be no doubt, whatsoever, upon reading the provisions of the Constitution as a whole, that the orbits of legislative and judicial power are not the same. But, so far as the orbits of legislative power are concerned, it is clear that those of Parliament and of the State Legislatures are not mutually exclusive in every respect. There is also a concurrent field of legislation. And, there is nothing there which could come in the way of the plenary legislative power conferred upon our Parliament in fields assigned to it. These can be limited, at the most, by a necessary or unavoidable implication, such as the one which must flow from the conferment of judicial and legislative and executive powers separately, with unmistakably different characteristics, upon different authorities. The basic scheme of the Constitution could certainly be invoked to invalidate legislation by parliament, acting in ita ordinary law-making capacity, on a subject which ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

UNION OF INDIA (Beg, C.J.) 681 falls either exclusively within the orbit of an amendment of \"the Constitu- tion\" or in List II of the Seventh Schedule exclusively State subjects. But, as I have indicated above, this is not so here. 128. Thus, it is clear that whenever the doctrine of the basic structure has been expounded or applied it is only as a doctrine of interpretation of the Constitution as it actually exists and not of a Constitutiorr which could exist only subjectively in the minds of different individuals as mere theories about what the Constitution is. The doctrine did not add to the contents of the Constitution. It did not, in theory, deduct anything from what was there. It only purported to bring out and explain the meaning of what was already there. It was, in fact, used by all the Judges for only this purpose with differing results simply because their assessments or inferences as to what was part of the basic in our Constitution differed. This, I think, is the correct interpretation of the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution. It should only be applied if it is. clear, beyond the region of doubt, that what is put forward as a restriction upon otherwise clear and plenary legislative power is there a■ a constitutional imperative. 129. If this be the correct view about the basic structure, as a mode of interpreting the Constitution only, the so-called federalism as a fetter on legislative power must find expression in some express provision to be recognised by Courts. It may be mentioned here that a majority of Judges who decided the K,savananda Bharati's cas, (supra) have not treated \"federa- lism\" as part of the basic structure of the Constitution. And, none of them has discussed the extent of the \"federal\" part of this structure. It is not enough to point to Article I of the Constitution to emphasize that our Republic is a \"union,, of States. That, no doubt is true. But, the word \"union\" was used in the context of the peculiar character of our federal Republic revealed by its express provisions. We have still to find, from other express provisions, what this \"union\" means or what is the extent or nature of \"federalism\" implied by it. The Constitution itself does not use the word \"federation\" at all. In any case, after examining all the express provisions of the Constitution, relied upon by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff, I am unable to discover l:here any such fetter which could, by a necessary implication, prevent Parliament from enacting Section 3 of the Act. 130. Indeed, if the theory of necessary implications is to be applied here, the entrenched provisions of our Constitution, for which a special procedure for amendment is prescribed within Article 368 itself, together with the other provisions discussed above, give the express limits to which the operations of the federal principles is confined in our Constitution. None of the expressly mentioned features could, by any necessary impli- cation, impinge upon the expressly given and distributed legislative powers. The doctrine that express mention excludes that which is not so mentioned applies also to express limitations. If the scheme of distribution of legislative powers is basic and express, with its own express limitations, \"'implied\" or unspecified alleged limitations going beyond that scheme are eliminated by the very force of the express provisions . 131.

In that case, the Commission was required to inquire into and report on the administration of affairs of certain companies specified in a schedule annexed to the. notification. It was held there, inter alia, that mere possibility of misuse of powers given by the Act could not vitiate the power conferred by the Act. It was also held there that the Act was made by Parliament acting in fields indicated by Entries 94 of List I and 45 of List III of the Seventh Schedule so that the inquiries could be ordered \"for the purposes of any of the matters in List I, List II and List III\". Incompetence of Parliament to legislate on matters in List II could not, it was held, vitiate power to order inquiries relating to subjects in that list in view of the express terms of Entry 45 in List III. It was held that the scope of inquiry may also cover matters ancilliary to the inquires themselves. Furthermore, relying on Kathi Raning Rawat v. Stale of SarashlraD, it was pointed out (at p. 293): The Commission has no power of adjudiction in the sense of passing an order which can be enforced proprio vigore. A clear distinction must, on the authorities, be drawn between a decision which, by itself, has no force and no penal effect and a decision which becomes enforcea- ble immediately or which may become enforceable by some action being taken. 132.

Nevertheless, the objects of the Act were considered and indicated there. 133. The purposes for which a Commission can be set up under the Act was considered long ago by a Division Bench of the Nagpur High Court in M. V. Rajwadt v. Dr. S. M. Hassan• which was cited with approval by this Court in Brajnandan Sinha v.

Such apportion- ments could be safely entrusted only to exper\\s who have had considerable judicial experience and can deal with complete impartiality an~ dexterity with issues raised. The moral or collective responsibility which is political is a different matter which may no doubt be affected by the report of a Commission of Inquiry. Individual liability may have even more serious consequences for the Minister concerned than the collective responsibility which carries only political implications. 135. In Stal, of Jammu and Kashmir v. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad81 this Court pointed out that even if Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad had ceased to be the Chief Minister of the State of J ammu and Kashmir his past actions would not cease to be matters of public importance. It definitely disapproved the view of the High Court when it said (at p. 407) :· These learned Judges _of the High Court expresaed the view that the acts of Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad would have been acts of public importance if he was in office but they ceased to be so as he was out of office when the Notification was issued. In taking this view, they appear to have based themselves on the observation made by this Court in Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar (supra) that \"the ·conduct of an individual may assume such a dangerous proportion and may ,o prejudicially affect or threaten to affect the public well-being a1 to make such conduct a definite matter of public importance, urgently calling for a full inquiry\". The learned Judges felt that since Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad was out of office, he had become innocuous; apparently, it was felt that he could no longer threaten the public well-being by his acts and so was outside the observation in Dalmia's case. We are clear in our mind that this is a misreading of this Court's observation. This Court, as the learned Judges themselves noticed, was n?t laying down an exhaustive definition of matter■ of public importance. What is to be inquired into in any case are necessarily past acts and it is because they have already affected the public well-being or their effect might do so, that they became matters of public importance. It is irrelevant whether the person who committed those acts is still in power to be able to repeat them. 136. The clear implication of the last mentioned pronouncement, with which I find myself in complete and respectful agreement, was that even if a Minister in the exercise of his official power does acts which may amount to criminal offences, yet, inquiry into them may be made as a matter of public importance and not of just private importance. And, what can be done when he is out of office may, a fortiori, be ordered when he is in office. This Court also said there as follows with which also I entirely agree (p. 406) : ... it is difficult to imagine how a Commission can be set up by a Council of Ministers to inquire into the acts of its head, the Prime Minister, while he is in office. It certainly would be a most unusual thing to happen. If the rest of the Council of Ministers resolves to have any inquiry, the Prime Minister can be expected to ask for their resignation. In any case, he would himself go out.

If he went out himself, then the Commission would be set up to inquire into the acts of a person who was no longer in office and for that reason, if the learned Judges of the High C_ourt were right, into matters which were not of public ·importance. The result would be that the acts of a Prime Minister could never be inquired into under the Act. We find it extremely difficult to accept that view. 137: In P. V. Jagannath Rao v. Stat, of Orissa'' it was held by a Constitution Bench of this Court that the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry under Section 3 of the Act with the object of enabling the Government to frame \"appropriate legislative or administrative measures to maintain the purity and integrity of the political administration in the State\" was valid . 138. Again in Krishna Ballabh Sahay v. Commission of Enquir;,88 a similar view was taken and it was observed by this Court with reference to the charges of corruption into the conduct of MinistE>rs (at p. 394): It cannot be stated sufficiently strongly that the public life of persons in authority must never admit of such charges being even framed against them. If they can be made then an inquiry whether to establish 1:hem or to clear the name of the person charged is called for. . .. A perusal of the grounds assures us that the charges are specific, and that records rather than oral testimony will be used to establish them. 139. I may also say that I fully agree with the views expressed by Kailasam, C.J., of the Madras High Court, in M. Karunnanidhi v. Tiu Union of India'8. 140. I may mention that the considerations placed before us for assailing the legislative competence of Parliament, having been rejected by us as quite insubstantial, could not be utilised for \"reading down\" the provisions of Section 3 of the Act-a procedure which may be sometimes available for saving a provision from partial or total invalidity. \"Reading down\" is, after all, only a logical outcome of the principle of construction- Ul Res Magi.r Voleat Quam Pereat (See: Craies on \"Statute Law\" Sixth Edn, p. 103). 141.

UNION OF INDIA (Beg, C.J.) 68S the meaning and the ambit and the applicability of the particular provisions of the Constitution whose operations are of vital interest to every State. Indeed, the interpretations given to these provisions must necessarily be of great concern to the Union as well. They are matters which involve the interests of the whole of the people of India who gave unto themselves the Constitµtion whose provisions we have interpreted. 143. The Union of India, acting through the Central Government, could be said to represent the whole of the people of India. The individual States, acting through their Governments and Ministers, could be said Jo represent the people of each individual State and their mtere!\\ts. When differences arise between the representatives of the State and those of the whole people of India on questions of interpretation of the Constitution, which must affect the welfare of the whole people, and particularly that of the people of the State concerned, it appears to me, with great respect, to be too technical an argument to be accepted by us that a suit does not lie in such a case under Article 131 of the Constitution. 144. According to both sides to the case before us an exercise of powers under Section 3 of the Act is called for. They differ only on the que6tion whether the Government of the State concerned or the Central Government also, on the facts of this case, can exercise those powers. Their claims conflict. There is a lis. The parties to the dispute are before us. We had to decide it and we have done so. It seems to me that a distinction between the State and its Government is, at the most, one between the whble and an inseparable part of the whole. It would be immaterial as regards claims on behalf of either the State or its Government whether the two are distinct juristic entities. Even if they could be distinctly separate, which is doubtful, the claim of the Government would be that of the State. H5. In State of Rajasth.an v. Union of India4° this Court has recently considered the scope of Article 13 l. There, I said, inter alia, on this question (at p. 1393) (SCC p. 635) : I do not think that we need take a too restrictive or a hyper- technical view of the State's rights to sue for any rights, actual or fancied, which the State Government chooses to take up on behalf of the State concerned in a suit under Article 13 l. It may be explained here that this observation was not meant to lay down more than that there would be presumed to be a nexus between the interests of the State and of the people it represents when the Government of the State takes up an issue relating to the interpretation of the Constitution against an aetion taken, or, even, as was the case there, one contemplated by the Central Government. I would like to remove the impression that no such nexus is needed if the use of the words \"actual or fancied\", in the observations quoted above, create it. I, however, think that, in the case before us, the nexus between the rival claims advanced and the interests of the public of the State is reasonably made out. It is a different matter that I do not accept the view put forward on behalf of the State of K~rnataka that it alone and not the Union Government also has the power to set up a Commission under Section 3 of the Act on a matter of public importance primarily concering the State. H6. It has to be remembered that Article 131 is traceable to Sec- tion 204 of the Government of India Act. The jurisdiction conferred by it 40.

It is a remnant of the federalism found in that Act. It should, therefore, be widely and generously interpreted for that reason too so as to advan...:e the intended remedy. It can be invoked, in my opinion, whenever a State and other States or the Union differ on a question of interpretation of the Constitution so that a decision of it will affect the scope or exercise of governmental powers which arc attributes of a State. It makes no difference to the maintainability of the action if the powers of the State, which are Executive, Legislative, and Judicial, are exercised through particular individuals as they necessarily must be. It is true that a criminal act committed by a Minister is no part of his official duties. But, if any of the organs of the State claim exclusive power to take cognizance of it, the State, as such, becomes interested in the dispute about the legal competence or extent of powers of one of its organs which may emerge. 147. I do not think that the fact that the State acts through its Ministers or officials can affect the maintainability of a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution. Both Article 166(3) of our Constitution as well as Section 59(3) of the Government oflndia Act of 1935 provided for allocation of the business of the Government among the Ministers for \"the more convenient transaction of the business\". Tb.is implies that the State can act not merely through its Government as a whole but also through its individual Ministers as provided by the rules. Section 49(1) of the Govern- ment of India Act made this position absolutely clear by enacting : The executive authority of a Province shall be exercised on behalf of His Majesty by the Governor, either directly or through officers sub- ordinate to him. The equivalent to that is Article 154(1) of our Constitution which reads as follows: 154. Executive power of State.-(l) The executive power of the,State shall be vested in the Governor and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with this Constitution. 148. In King-Emperor v. Sibnath Banerji'1 the Privy Council had held that \"a Minister is an officer subordinate to the Governor\" for the purposes of Section 49 of the Government of India Act only. This observation was no doubt relied upon by this Court in A. Sanfaevi Naidu v. State of Madras (supra) with regard to the position of our Ministers for the purposes of Article 154(1) of the Constitution. These provisions, f.ar from establishing any antithesis between the official capacity of a Minister and the State for which he acts, only show that, as a Minister, he is an agent or a limb of the Government of the State, and, therefore, he can be treated as an \"officer\" for purposes of Article 154(1) which corresponds to Section 49 of the Government of India Act. The result is that a Minister's official acts cannot be distinguished fr;m those of the State on whose behalf he acts. With great respect for the view of my learned brethren who seem to hold other- wise, this feature cannot make a suit by the State under Article 131 of the Constitution incompetent merely because it relates to the exercise of a Minister's powers enjoyed by virtue of his office. There is nothing in Article 131 of the Constitution itself to debar the State, which must always 41.

UNlON OP INDIA (Beg, C.J.) 687 necessarily act through its officers or agents or Ministers, from suing the Central Government not only to protect one of its agents, officers, or Ministers from being proceeded against, in any way, by the Central Govern- ment, but to prefer its own claim to exclusive power to deal witlt him; and, this is what the plaintiff has done by means of the suit before us. 149. It is evident that a Minister has been treated, in the two cases cited before us as an \"officer\" for the very limited purpose of indicating that the State itself can act through him as he holds an office which enables him to act for it. They do not equate or assimilate his status <?r position with that of a Government servant. In my opinion, the Minister of a State, as the holder of an office provided for by the Constitution is, like a Judge of a High Court, a \"dignitary of State\" to \\I.Se the expression employed by Sir William Holdsworth, the eminent British constitutional lawyer and jurist, for a High Court Judge. His dignity and position is bound up with that of the State he represents. Hence, his State is entitled to sue to assert it. 150. It may be possible sometimes to distinguish a purely individual wrongful or criminal act, committed by a Minister, falling entirely outside the scope of his legal authority, as disconnected with his office. But, even this cannot, in my opinion, disable the State itself from suing for the pro- tection of its own authority to deal with the Minister concerned. It is, as I have already indicated, a different matter if we hold, as we have held here, that the claim of the State to have exclusive power to deal with its Minister is not sustainable for some reason. The right to advance a claim, which is all that Article 131 provides for, is to be distinguished from the strength of that claim in law . So long as the claim is of the State, the fact that a Minister, in exercising governmental power■, represents the State, can make no difference whatsoever to the maintainability of the suit by the State. 151. I think that the State concerned, which challenges the validity of the action of the Central Government againat one or more of its Ministers in respect of acts involving exercise of its governmental powers, would have · sufficient interest to maintain a suit under Article 13 l because it involves claims to what appertains to the State as a \"State\". It may be that, if the effect upon the rights or interests of a State, as the legal entity which constitutes the legally set up and recognised governmental organisation of the people residing within certain territorial limits is too remote, indirect, or infinitesimal, upon the facts of a particular case, we may hold that it is not entitlt>d to maintain a suit under Article 131. But, I do not think that we can say that here. 152. The following cases were cited by the plaintiff's Counsel: The GoM\"nor-Gtneral in Council v. The Prooince of Madrtu'1 ; United Provinces v. Governor-General in Council\" ; Attorney-General for Victoria at the Relation o.f Dale v. The Commonwealth\"; Attorne.,-General for Victoria (at the Relation of the Victorian Chamber of Manufaeturers) v. The Commonwealth\"'; State of Rajasthan v. Union of India (supra) . Except for the last mentioned case they are not directly helpful on the scope of Article 131 or on the right of a State to sue under it. They, however, indicate the kind of questions on which and the persons through whom the units and the Central authorities in a federation may litigate. 42.

The views expressed here will not, therefore, be deemed to have any bearing on questions relating to the validity of the State Government's notification which were not canvassed before us.

(concurring).-Consequent upon the result of the elec- tions held to the Karanataka Legislative Assembly in 1972, the Congress formed the Government with Shri D. Devaraj Urs as the Chief Minister of the State. That party was then in power at the Centre too, but it lost its longheld majority in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections after which the Janata Party formed the Government at the Centre. However in those elections to the Lok Sabha, 26 out of 28 seats allotted to the State of Karnataka were won by the Congress. 156. Certain opposition members of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly submitted to the Union Home Minister a memorandum containing allegations of corruption, favouritism and nepotism against the Chief Minister, Shri Devaraj Urs. In response to a request of the Union Home Minister, the Chief Minister offered his comments on the allegations but, while repelling the accusations as frivolous and politically motivated, the Chief Minister raised a point which forms the nucleus of the arguments advanced in the suit before us. He contended that the federal structure enshrined in the Constitution is the corner-stone of national integrity; that, the Constitution is the source of the power of the Centre and the States; that the exercise of all powers, whether by the Central Government or by the State Governments, must conform to the scheme of distribution of powers devised under the federal scheme of our Constitution ; that the erring Ministers of State Governments are accountable to the State Legislature only ; and that, the Central Government has no authority or control over the Govern- ment of a State in respect of matters which are within the State's exclusive domain, save in exceptional times when an emergency is in operation. The Chief Minister asserted that an enquiry into the charges levelled against him could only be held by or at the instance of the State Government. 157.

The validity of this notification is challenged by the State of Karnataka by the present suit brought under Article 131 of the Constitution. The Union of India and Shri A. N. Grover are impleaded to the suit as defendants l and 2 respectively. 158. The State of Karnataka contends by its plaint that the Central Government has no jurisdiction or authority to constitute the Commission in the purported exercise of its powers under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952; that the appointment of the Commission of Inquiry by the Central Government for inquiring into allegations against Ministers of the State Government while they continue to be in office and enjoy the confi- dence of the State Legislature is destructive of the federal structure of the Constitution and the scheme of distribution of powers provided for under it ; that the cabinet system of government under which the Council of Ministers is responsible to the Legislature of the State would fail of its purpose if the Union executive were to assume to itself the power to direct an inquiry into allegations made against State Ministers while they are in office; that the provisions contained in Section 3 of the Act of 1952 cannot be interpreted so as to clothe the Central Government with the power to appoint a Commission for inquiring into matters relatable to any of the entries in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, in respect of which Parliament has no power to make a law and the Union executive no power to take executive action; that such an interpretation would render Section 3 of the Act ultra vires the provisions of Part XI of the Constitution which deals exhaustively with the relations between the Union and the States; and that, the report of the Inquiry Commission appointed by the Union Govern- ment cannot serve any useful purpose as the Central Government is incompe- tent to take any remedial, executive or-legislative, action against the Ministers of the State Government or the State Government itself. 159. These contentions are traveraed by the Union of India by its written statement. It has, in the first instance, raised a preliminary objection that the suit itself is not maintainable as the appointment of the Commission to inquire into the personal conduct of the Chief Minister and other Ministers does not affect any legal right of the State of Karnataka. It further contends that the notification issued by the State Government neither covers the questions comprised in the notification of the Central Government nor does it cover all of the matters mentioned in the latter notification; that the Central Government is competent to constitute a Commission to inquire into a definite matter of public importance, namely, the conduct of a Minister of State Government; and that, the appointment of the Com- mission is neither destructive of the federal structure of the Constitution nor of any other basic feature thereof. 160. Three issues were framed by this Court on these pleadings.

On the preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the suit, I prefer to adhere to the view which I took in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India••, where a similar objection was raised by the Union Government to the suits filed by the State of Rajasthan and certain other States under Article 131 of the Constitution, challenging a directive of the Union Home Minister advising the dissolution of State Assemblies. I have had the benefit of perusing the judgment prepared by Brother Untwalia on behalf of himself and Brethren Shinghal and J aswant Singh in which they have taken the view that the Commission of Inquiry set up by the Central Government is not against the State or the State Government but is against an individual Minister or Ministers and since the setting up of the Commission does not involve any invasion of the legal rights of the State or the State Government, the suit is not maintainable under Article 131 at the instance of the State of Karnataka. I am free to confess that I have considerably profited by the judgment of my learned Brethren because their point of view, with respect, is not to be overlooked simply because I have already expressed a contrary opinion in an earlier decision. But having given a fresh and closer thought to the problem in the light of the view expressed by them and a fuller argument advanced in this case by the learned Additional Solicitor-General, I am inclined to the opinion that even taking a strictly legalistic view of the matter, the preliminary objection to the maintainability of the suit ought to be rejected. 162. The jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 131 of the Constitution should not be tested on the anvil of banal rules which are applied under the Code of Civil Procedure for determining whether a suit is maintainable. Article 131 undoubtedly confers 'original jurisdiction' on the Supreme Court and the commonest form of a legal proceeding which is tried by a Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction is a suit. But a constitutional provision, which confers exclusive jurisdiction on this Court to entertain disputes of a certain nature in the exercise of its original jurisdic- tion, cannot be equated with a provision conferring a ri~ht on a Civil Court to entertain a common suit so as to apply to an original proceeding under Article 131 the canons of a suit which is ordinarily triable under Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure by a Court of the lowest grade competent to try it. Advisedly, the Constitution does not describe the proceeding which may be brought under Article 131 as a 'suit' and significantly, Article 131 uses words and phrases not commonly employed for determining the jurisdic- tion of a Court of first instance to entertain and try a suit. It does not speak of a 'cause of action', an expression of known and definite legal import in the word of witness actions. Instead, it employs the word 'dispute', which is no part of the elliptical jargon of law . But above all, Article 131 which in a manner of speaking is a self-contained code on matters falling within its purview, provides expressly for the condition subject to which an action can lie under it.

J.) 691 parties referred to in clauses (a) to (c) must involve a question on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. 163. The quintessence of Article 131 is that there has to be a dispute between the parties regarding a question on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. A challenge by the State Government to the authority of the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry clearly involves a question on which the existence or extent of the legal right of the Central Government to appoint ·the Commission of Inquiry depends and that is enough to sustain the proceeding brought by the State under Article 131 of the Constitution. Far from its being a case of the \"omission of the obvious\", justifying the reading of words into Article 131 which are not there, I consider that the Constitution has purposefully conferred on this Court a jurisdiction which is untrammelled by considerations which fetter the jurisdiction of a Court of first instance, wh~ch entertains and tries suits of a civil nature. The very nature of the disputes arising under Article 131 is different, both in form and substance, from the nature of claims which require adjudication in ordinary suits. 16-t. The Constitution aims at maintaining a fine balance not only between the three organs of power, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, but it is designed to secure a similar balance betwec•n the powt>rs of the Central Government and those of the State Governments. The legislative lists in the Seventh Schedule contain a demarcation of legMative powers between the Central and State Governments. The t>xecutive power of the Central Government extends to matters with respect to which Parlia- ment has the power to make laws while that of the State extends to matters with respect to which the State Legislature has the power to makt> laws. Part XI of the Constitution is devoted specially to the delineation of relations between the Union and the States. That is a delicate . relationship, particularly if diffnent political parties are in power at the Centre and in the States. The object of Article 131 is to provide a high-powt>red machinery for ensuring that the Central Government and the State Governments act within the respective spheres of their authority and do not trespass upon each other's constitutional functions or powers. Therefore, a challenge to the constitutional capacity of the 'defendant' to act in an intended manner is enough to attract the application of Article 131, particularly when the 'plaintiff' claims that right exclusively for itself. If it fails to establish that right, its challenge may fail on merits but the proceeding cannot be thrown out on the ground that the impugned order is not calculated to affect or impair a legal right of the plaintiff. 165. In an ordinary civil suit, the rejection of a right assertt>d by the defPndant cannot corrPspondingly and of its own force establish the right claimed by the plaintiff. But proceedings under Article 131 are adjudicatory of the limits of constitutional power vested in the Central and State Govern- ments. The claim that the defendant (the Central Government here) does not possess the requisite power involves the assertion that the power to appoint the Commission of lnquiry is vested exclusively in the plaintiff (the State Government here). In a civil suit the plaintiff has to succeed on the strength of his own title, not on the weakness of hi~ adversary because the defendant may be a rank trespasser and yet he can lawfully hold on to his possession against the whole world except the true owner. If the plaintiff is not the true owner, his suit must fail. A proceeding under Article l 31 stands in sharp contrast with an ordinary civil suit.

There is no third alternative as in a civil suit wherein the right claimed by the plaintiff may reside neither in him nor in the defendant but in a stranger. A demarcation and definition of ~onstitutional power between the rival claimants and restricted to them and them alone is what a proceeding under Article 131 necessarily involves. That is how in such a proceeding, a denial of the defendant's right carries with it an assertion of the plaintiff's. Firstly, therefore, I am unable to appreciate that if•a State Government challenges the constitutional right1 of the Central Government to take a particular course of action, Article 131 will still not be attracted. Secondly, the contention of the State Government in the present proceeding is JlOt only that the Central Government has no power to appoint the Inquiry Commission for inquiring into the conduct of State Ministers but that such a right is ·exclusively vested in the State Government. There is, therefore, not only a denial of the right claimed by the Ce\"ntral Govern- ment but an assertion that the rigat exclusively resides in the State Government. In a sPnse, the instant case stands on a stronger footing than the Rajasthan case (supra) because there the challenge made by the State Governments could perhaps be characterised as purely negative in nature since the basic contention was that the Central Government had no power to dissolve the State Assemblies. There is, therefore, all the greater reason here for rejecting the preliminary objection. 166. The State of Karnataka has claimed an alternative relief that if Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act is construed as authorising the Central Government to issue the impugned notification, it is ultra vires as being in violation of Article 164(2) and the 'federal scheme' embodied in the Constitution. Whether this contention is well-founded or not is another matter but it seems to me difficult to hold that the State of Karnataka does not even have the legal right to contend that the provision of a parliamentary statute authorising the Central Government to act in a particular manner is unconstitutional. 167. The palliative of a writ petition under Article 226 which is suggested on behalf of the Union Government as a sovereign remedy in such matters is hardly any substitute for a proceeding under Article 131. It is notorious that writ petition has its own limitations and indeed many a petition under Article 226 is rejected with the familiar quip : \"Why don't you file a suit?\". Apart from disputes between the Government of India and a State Government, Article 131 contemplates other permutations and combinations in the matter of array of parties. A dispute between one or more States or between the Government of India and a State on one hand and another State or other States on the other hand cannot appropriately be decided by a High Court under Article 226 and that could not have been the intendment of the Constituti9n. Disputes of the nature described in Article 131 are usually of an urgent nature and their decision can brook no delay. It is therefore, expedient in the interest of justice that they should, as far as possible, be brought before and decided by this Court so as to obviate the dilatoriness of a possible appeal. An original proceeding decided by this Court is decided once and for all. 168. For these reasons I reject the preliminary objection raised by the Union Government and hold that the proceeding brought by the State of Karnataka is maintainable under Article 131 of the Constitution. 169.

Clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to Section 3(1) cut down the width of that power with a view to ensuring that the Central Government and the State Governments do not appoint parallel Commissions which will simul- taneously inquire into the 'same matter'. Since, in the instant case, the State of Karnataka had appointed a Commission of Inquiry before the Union Government issued the impugned notification, clause (b) of the proviso will be attracted. That clause says that if a Commission has been appointed to inquire into any matter (b) by a State Government, the Central Government shall not appoint another Commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the Commission appointed by the State Government is functioning, unless the Central Government is of opinion that the scope of the in- quiry should be extended to two or more States. The question for consideration is whether the appointment of the Commis- sion of Inquiry by the Central Government violates the injunction contained in this clause. 170. Considering the terms of the notifications issued by the State Government and the Central Government and the matters into which the respective Commissions are directed to inquire, it seems obvious that the object and purpose of the two inquiries is basically of different character. The very preambles to the two notifications highlight this difference and show that they are directed to different ends. The preamble of the Karna- taka notification recites : Whereas allegations have been made on the floor. of the Houses of the State Legisl\"°ture and elsewhere that irregularities have been com- mitted/excess payments made in certain matters relating to contracts, grants of land, allotments of sites, purchase of furniture, disposal of food-grains, etc. Now, therefore,. . . the Government of Karnataka hereby appoint ... the Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an inquiry into the said allegations, particularly specified below. · The preamble of the Central Government notification on the other hand recites: Whereas the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary to appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an inquiry into a definite matter of public importance, namely, charges of corrup- tion, nepotism, favouritism or misuse of governmental power against thE\" Chief Minister and certain other Ministers of the State of Karnataka, hereinafter specified ... The terms of reference of the two Commissions disclose the same funda- mental difference. The primary object of the State Government in appoint- ing the Com.mission is to ascertain whether improper or excessive payments were made, undue favours were shown, irregularity or fraud had occurred in the conduct of official business etc; and secondarily to find out as to \"who are the persons responsible for the lapses, if any, regarding the aforesaid and to what extent\".

COutlT CASES (1977) 4 sec ment to contend that the Central Government has appointed the Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of inquiring into the 'same matter' into which the Commission of Inquiry appointed by the State Government is directed to inquire. In fact, the Central Government notification provides expressly by Clause 2(a)(ii) that the Commission will inquire into the allegation contained in the memoranda submitted by certain members of the Karnataka State Legislature, \"excluding any matter covered by the notification of the Govern- ment of Karnataka\". 171. The argument that the two notifications cover the same matter suffers from a lack of recognition of ordinary political realities. It is hardly ever possible, except in Utopian conditions, that the State Government will appoint a Commission to inquire into acts of corruption, favouritism and nepotism on the part of its Chief Minister. It is interesting that Sir Thomas More coined the name 'Utopia' from the Greek ou (not) and topos (place) which together mean \"no place'~. It is inconceivable that a Commission of Inquiry will be appointed by a State Government without the concurrence of the Chief Minister and if the political climate is so hostile that he is obliged to submit to an inquiry into his own conduct, he will quit rather than concur. Indeed, a Council of Ministers which considers that the conduct of its Chief Minister and some of the Ministers requires examination in a public inquiry, shall have forfeited the confidence of the Legislature and would ordinarily have to tender its resignation. Thus, the objection of the State Government that the notification of the Central Government offends against clause ( h) of the proviso to Section 3 ( 1) of the Act is factually unfounded and theoretically unsound. 172. Having disposed of the objections which were of a preliminary nature, it is nl:!cessary now to consider the merits of the rival contentions on issues 2 and 3. 173. Shri Lal -Narayan Sinha, who appears on behalf of the State of Karnataka, contends that Section 3( 1) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act should not be construed as authorising the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry. for the purpose of inquiring into the conduct of a sitting Minister of a State Government. It is impossible, on a plain reading of the section, to accept this contention. Section 2(a)(i) and (ii) of the Act define \"appropriate Government\" to mean (i) the Central Government, in relation to a Commission appointed by it to make an inquiry into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List I or List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution; and (ii) the State Government, in relation to a Commission appointed by it to make an inquiry into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. 173A. Section 3(1) empowers the \"appropriate Government\" ifit is of opinion that it is necessary so to do, and obliges it if a resolution in that behalf is passed by the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of the State as the case may be, to appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance.

J.) 695 the provisions of Section 3(1) so as to limit the power of the Central Govern- ment to appointing Commissions of Inquiry for inquiring into the conduct of persons in relation to matters concerning the affairs of the Union Govern- ment only. Section 3(1) empowers the Central Government to appoint a Commission for making an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance. It is inarguable that the conduct of Ministers of State Govern- ments in the purported discharge of their official functions is not a definite matter of public importance within the meaning of Section 3(1). To what extent the principle of federalism will be impaired by such a construction will of course have to be examined with care but I see no substance in the contention that the Central Government does not even possess the power to collect facts in regard to allegations of corruption made by a section of the State Legislature against sitting Ministers of the State Government. That power must undoubtedly be exercised sparingly and with restraint because under the guise of directing an inquiry under Section 3( l). the Central Government cannot interfere with the day-to-day working of the State Government. One cannot also contradict that what appears to be a proper use of power may sometimes contain a veiled abuse of power, howsoever infinitesimally. But statutory constructiou cannot proceed on distrust and suspicion of those who are charged with the duty of administering laws. Section 3(1) must, therefore, receive its proper construction with the reserva- tion that mala fides vitiate all acts. Lack of bona fides was alleged but was not pressed in this case. In my opinion therefore, Section 3( 1) cannot be given a restricted meaning, as canvassed by the State Government. \\ 174. On this view, the contention that Section 3(1) should be read down and the impugned notification should be set aside as falling outside the scope of that section has to be rejected. But then it is urged by the State that if the section cannot be given a restricted meaning and has to be construed widely so as to authorise the Central Government to direc,t the holding of inquiries into the conduct of sitting State Ministers, the provision would be rendered unconstitutional for a variety of reasons. Those reasons must now be considered. 175. It is said in the first place that if the language of Section 3(1) is construed widely, it will not only enable the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to inquire into the conduct of sitting Ministers of State Governments but it will, applying the same rule of .. construction, also enable the State Government to appoint similar \"Commissions of Inquiry to inquire into the conduct of the Central Ministers. This, according to the State's Counsel, would offend against the provisions of Articles 75(3) and L64(2) of the Constitution. These articles provide respectively that the Central Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People and the State Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State. The argument is that the power to appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of inquiring into the con- duct of sitting Ministers of another Government is destructive of the principle of collective responsibility enunciated in these articles. This argument is :.aid to receive support from the circumstance that by virtue of Article 194(3), it is the privilege of the Legislative Ass,..mbly of the State to appoint a com- mittee for inquiring into the conduct of any its members, including a Minis- ter. That privilege, according to the learned Counsel, is as inviolable as the principle of collective responsibility. 176. I find it impossible to accept this contention.

Whatever may be the findings of a Commission of Inquiry, the Council of Ministers, whether at the Centre or in the States, continues to be collectively answerable or accountable to the House of the People or the Legislative Auembly. Indeed, neither the appointment of the Commission nor even the rejection by the Commission of all or any of the allegations referred to it for its inquiry would make the Council of Ministers any the less answerable to those bodies. The object of the two articles of the Consti- tution on which the State of Karnataka relies is to provide that for every decision taken by the Cabinet, each one of the Ministen is responsible to the Legislature concerned. It is difficult to accept that for acts of corruption, nepotism or favouritism which are alleged or proved against an individual Minister, the entire Council of Ministers can be held collectively responsible to the Legislature. If an individual Minister uses his office as an occasion or pretence for committing acts of corruption, he would be personally ans~er- able for his unlawful acts and no question of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers can arise in such a case. As observed by Hegde, J. while speaking for a Constitutional Bench of this Court in A. Sanj,,oi Naidu v. Stat, of Madrasl', the essence of collective responsibility of th~ Council of Ministen u that the Cabinet is responsible to thP. Legislature for every action taken in any of the ministries. In other words, the principle of collective responsibility governs only those acts which a Minister performs or can reasonably be said to have performed in the lawful discharge of his official functions. 177. The history of the principle of collective responsibility in England shows that it was originally developed as against the King. The Ministers maintained a common front against the King, accepted joint and several responsibility for their decisions whether they agreed with them or not, and resigned in a body if the King refused to accept their advice. In relation to the British Parliament, collective responsibility means that the Cabinet presents a common front. In Melboume's famous phrase, 'the Cabinet Ministers must all say the same thing'. The principle of collective responsibility perhaps compels Ministers to compromise with their conscience, but in matters of policy they have to speak with one voice, each one of them being responsible for the decision taken by the Cabinet. '8 178. In his book on ccconstitutional and ..4.dmini.rtratiu, Law\" (Ed. 1971, page 175), S. A. de Smith says that the collective responsibility of the Cabinet to the House of Commons is sometimes spoken of as democratic bulwark of the British Constitution. According to the learned author, collective responsibility implies that all Cabinet Ministera assume responsi- bility for Cabinet decisions and action taken to implement those decisions. A Minister may disagree with a decision or with the manner of its imple- mentation, but if he wishes to expreu a dissent in public he should first tender his resignation. 179. While explaining the principle of collective responsibility, Sir lvor Jennings in his book \"Cabinet Gooernmmt\" (Third Ed., 1959, p. 277) says: For all that passes in Cabinet (said Lord Salisbury in 1878) each member of it who does not resign is absolutely and irretrievably 47.

The learned author says that perhaps Mr. Joseph Chamberlain's definition of collective responsibility was better since he had occasion to study the matter both as enfant terrible under Mr. Gladstone and in his middle age under Lord Salisbury. According to Mr. Chamberlain Absolute frankness in our private relations and full discussion of all matters of common interest ... the decisions freely arrived at should be loyally supported and considered as the decisions of the whole of the Government. Of course there may be occ::isions in which the difference is of so vital a character that it is impossible for the minority ... to continue their support,· and in this case the Ministry breaks up or the minority member or members resign. 180. Thus the argument that Section 3(1) of the Act will offend against the principle of collective responsibility unless it is construed narrowly is without any substance. As regards the suggested involvement of Article 194 (3), \"in the absence of a specific provision in the Constitution that the conduct of a member of the Legislature shall be inquired into by the Legislature only, it is impossible to hold that the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry under the Act constitutes an interference with the privilege of the legislature. English precedents relating to the privileges of the House of Commons, which are relevant under Article 194(3), do not support the State's contention. 181. That disposes of an important limb of the State's submission. The other contentions of the State Government directed towards showing that the impugned notification is unconstitutional are these : (a) The charges contained in the impugned notification relate to corruption, nepotism, favouritism and misuse of governmental power by the Chief Minister and other Ministers in relation to the executive powers exercisable directly or through subordinate officers and neither the Central executive nor the Parliament can exercise any control over the State executive, except during an emergency; (b) India being a union of States one must, while interpreting the Constitution, have regard to the essential features and the general scheme of our federal or quasi-federal Constitution in which the powers of the Union of India and the States are clearly defined and demarcated. ''To hold otherwise would mean that the Union executive would effectively control the State executive which is opposed to the basic scheme of our federal Constitution\"; (c) Neither Article 248 of the Constitution which confers exclusive residuary powers of legislation on Parliament with respect to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or the State List nor the residuary Entry 97 in List I can include the power to make a law vesting in the Central Government a supervisory control over the State Government; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Such an empowerment can be made in the exercise of constituent power only after following the procedure prescribed by Article 368 of the Constitution ; and Legislative and administrative relations between the Union and the States having been defined in the Constitution, the provisions relating thereto are exhaustive of that subject and therefore legislation in regard to Centre-State relationship is prohibited by necessary implication.

The dominant note of these submissions is one and one only: that the Central executive cannot, save by a constitutional amendment, be given power to control the functions of the State exec\"utive through the medium of a Commission of Inquiry. Whether Parliament has the competence to pass the impugned legislation in the exercise of its legislative, as distinguished from constituent power is a separate matter, but before considering the validity of the State's contention in that behalf, it is necessary to examine whether the assumption underlying that contention is at alljustified, namely that by the impugned legislation, Parliament has conferred on the Central Government the power to control the executive functions of the State Government. For that purpose it is necessary to have a proper understanding of the scheme and· purpose of the Commissions of Inquiry Act and the true effect of its more important provisions. 183. The Commissions of Inquiry Act was passed by the Parliament in 1952 in order to provide for the appointment of Commiasions of Inquiry and for vesting them with certain powers. Section 3(1) read with Section 2(a) of that Act empowers, in so far as is relevant, the Central Government to appoint by notification a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance and perform such functions as may be specified in the notification. The Commission has thereupon to make the inquiry and perform its functions, one of which of course is to submit its report to the Government. Section 3(4) requires that the Central Government shall cause to be laid before the House of the People the report of the Commission of Inquiry together with a memorandum of the action taken thereon, within a period of six months of the submission of the report by the Commission. Section 4 confers on the Commission some of the powers possessed by a Civil Court while trying a suit, like. enforcing the attendance of witnesses, examining them on oath, discovery and production of documents, receiving evidence on affidavit, requisitioning any public record, etc. Having regard to the nature of the inquiry and the other circumstances of the case, the Government can under Section 5(1) direct that all or any of the provisions contained in sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Section 5 shall apply to the Commission. Some of these sub-sections empower the Commission to require any penon to furnish information to the Commission and to enter into any building or place wheFe any document relating to the subject-matter of the inquiry may be found. For the purpose of conducting any investigation pertaining to the inquiry, the Commission by Section 5A can utilise the services in the case of a Commission appointed by the Central Government, of any officer or invei;tigation agency of the Central Government. 184. It is clear from these provisions and the general scheme of the Act that a Commission of Inquiry appointed under the Act is a purely fact-finding body which has no power to pronounce a binding or definitive judgment. It has to collect facts through the evidence led before it and on a consideration thereof it is required to submit its report which the appointing authority may or may not accept. There are sensitive matters of public importance which, if left to the normal investigational agencie&, can create needless controversies and generate an atmosphere of. suspicion.

No doubt this rarely happens, but when it does it is essential that public confidence should be restored, for without it no democracy can long survive. This confidence can be effectively restored only by thoroughly investigating and probing the rumours and allegations so as to search out and establish the truth. The truth may show that the evil exists, thus enabling it to be rooted out, or that there is no foundation in the rumours and allegations by which the public has been disturbed. In either case, confidence is r estored. A police investigation is, at its very best, a unilateral inquiry into an accusation since the person whose conduct is the subject-matter of inquiry has no right or opportunity to cross-examine the witness whose statements are being recorded by the police. Section 8C of the Act, on the other hand, confers the right of cross-examination, the right of audience and the right of representation through a legal practitioner on the appropriate Government, on every person referred to in Section 8B and with the per- mi.!.sion, of the Commission, on any other person whose evidence is recorded by the Commission. Clauses (a) and (b) of Section 8B refer respectively to persons whose conduct the Commission considers it necessary to inquire into and persons whose reputation, in the opinion of the Commission, is likely to be prejudicially affected by the inquiry. It is undeniable that the person whose conduct is being inquired into and if he be a Chief Minister or a Minister, the doings of the Government itself, are exposed to the fierce light of publicity. But that is a risk which is inherent in every inquiry directed a,t finding out the truth. It does not, however, justify the specious submission that the inquiry constitutes an interference with the executive functions of the State Government or that it confers on the Central Government the power to control the functions of the State executive. After all, it is in the interest of those against whom open allegations of corruption and nepotism are made that they should have an opportunity of repelling those allegations before a trained and independent Commission of Inquiry which is not hide-bound by the technical rules of evidence. \"It is only by establishing the truth that the purity and integrity of public life can be preserved\" and that is the object which the Commissions of Inquiry Act seeks to achieve. 185. In M. V. Rajwad, v. Dr. S . M. Hassan' 9 , it was held by the N agpur High Court that Section 4 of the Act merely clothes the Commission with certain powers of a Civil Court but does not confer on it the status of a Court and that the Commission is only fictionally a Civil Court for the limited purposes enumerated in Section 5(4). The Court observed that there is no accuser, no accused and no specific charges for trial before the Commission, nor is the Government, under the law, required to pronounce one way or the other on the findings of the Commission. In other words: The Commission governed by the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 is appointed by the State Government 'for the information of its own mind' . . . It is, therefore, a fact-finding body meant only to 49.

These observations were extracted and quoted with approval by this Court in Brajnandan Sinha v. Jyoti Narain50 • 1.. It is, therefore, clear the power conferred py Parliament on the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry under Section 3( 1) of the Act for the purpose of finding facts in regard to the allegations of corruption, favouritism and nepotism against a sitting Chief Minister or Ministers cannot be held to constitute interference with the executive functions of the State Government. On receipt of the Commission's report, the Central Government may or may not take any action, depending upon the nature of the findings recorded by the Commission. If it decides to take any action, the validity thereof may have to be tested in the light of the constitutional provisions. But until that stage arrives, it is difficult to hold that the Central Government is exercising any control or supervisory jurisdiction over the executive functions of the State Government. As observed by this Court in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendol/car61 , \"the Commission has no p_ower of adjudication in the sense of passing an order which can be enforced proprio uigore\". 187. Thus, the very assumption on which the State's Counsel has built up the edifice of his argument seems to me to be fallacious. The rejection of that assumption furnishes at once an answer to most of his other wbmissions but, since the matter has been argued on both sides fully and earnestly, it is desirable to consider all the rival contentions and set (sic) the dispute (sic) is that India is a Union of States and that one must, while inter- preting the CoI)stitution, have regard to the essential features and the general scheme of our federal or quasi-federal Constitution by which, the powers of the Union of India and the States are clearly defined and demarcated. Quoting a learned author on \"Constitutional Law of India\", Vol. 2, page 1074, Counsel contends that to hold otherwise would mean that the Union executive would effectively control the State executive, which is opposed to the basic scheme of our federal Constitution. 188. The statement from the \"Constitutional Law of India\" on which Counsel relies is out of context because it occurs in relation to the question whether in dismissing the Ministry or in dissolving the Legislature, the Governor acts as an agent of the President or under his directions. While Pxpre•sing the opinion that a responsible Union Ministry would not be justified in advising the removal of a Governor merely because he takes action which does not fall in line with the policy of the Union Ministry, the learned author says that any other view would vest in the Union executive effectivP control over the State executive, which is opposed to the basic scheme of our federal Constitution. Apart from the consideration that the statement relied upon is out of context, I have already rejected the submission that the appointment by the Central Government of a fact-finding Commission of Inquiry for inquiring into the conduct of sitting States Ministers can be deemed to vest effective control over the State executive in the Central executive. Counsel's submission shall, therefore have to be examined keeping aside this aspect of the matter. 189. India, undoubtedly, is a Union of States and that is what 50.

Whether we describe our Constitution as federal or quasi-federal, one cannot ever blind one's vision to the stark reality that India is a Union of States. The Constitution contains a carefully conceived demarcation of powers, legislative and executive, between the Central Government on the one hand and the State Government.~ on the other. The balance of that power ought never to be disturbed, but that is a different thing from saying that inherent or implied limitations should be read into legislative powers or that because India is a Union of States, one must read into the Constitution powers and pro- visions which are not to be found therein but which may seem to follow logically from what the Constitution provides for expressly. 190. The first question which one must tackle is whether Parliament has the legislative competence to enact the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. This question, in my opinion, is concluded by a judgment of a Constitution Bench of this Court in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia (supra) in which the validity of the very Act was challenged in a matter in which a noti- fication was issued by the Central GovemmPnt under Section 3 of the Act for inquiring into the affairs of certain companies. It was held by this Court that Parliament had the.legislative competence to pass the law under Entry 94 of List I and Entry 45 of List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Entry 94 of List I relates to \"Inquiries, surveys and statistics for the purpose of any of the matters'' in List I, while Entry 45 of List III relates to \"Inquiries and statistics for the purposes of any of the matters specified in List II or List III\". It is well-established that entries in the legislative lists must receive not a narrow or pedantic but a wide and liberal constry.ction and, considered from that point of view, the word 'inquiries' which occurs in the two entries must be held to cover the power to pass an Act providing for appointment of Commissions of Inquiry. It is in the e~ercise of this power that the Parliament has passed the Com- missions of Inquiry Act, 1952. Since the power to appoint a Commission to inquire into the conduct of sitting Ministers of State Governments which is comprehended within Section 3 (I) of the Act does not off end against the principle of collective responsibility of the State's Council of Ministers or against the privileges of the Legislative Assembly and since it does not also confer on the Central Government the power of control over the State executive, the provision must be held to be a valid exercise of the legislative competence of the Parliament. 191. Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia in so far as it decides that the Commis- sions of Inquiry Act, 1952 falls within the legislative competence of Parlia- ment in view of Entry 94 of List I and Entry 45 of List Ill must, with rrspect, be affirmed and accepted as good law. I may, however, add that if for any reason it were to appear, which it does not, that thPse entries do not justify the passing of the Act, the residuary Entry 97 of List I will in any event support the legislative validity of the Act. That entry confers on Parliament the power to legislate on \"Any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III. , .\". Entry 97 is in the nature of a residuary entry and the words \"Any other matter\" which appear therein mean \"Any matter other than those enumerated in List I\". If Entry 94 does not cover the impugned Act, \"Inquiries\" of the nature contemplated by the Act will fall within the description '' Any other matter\" ; and if Entry 45 of List III - and, admittedly, the whole of the State List are to be kept out of considera- tion, the Act will relate to 'a matter not enumerated in List II or List III'.

UNION OP INDIA (Chandrachud, J.) 703 ground that it cannot, any more than other entries in Lists I and III, confer on Parliament the power to make a law vesting in the Central executive supervisory control over the State executive. That contention having been rejected, Entry 97 will in any event sustain the legislative validity of the Act. 192. It is unnecessary to consider the implications of Article 248 because that may require an examination of the question, which is needless here in view of the decision in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia, whether that article confers power which is not to be found in Article 246(1) read with Entry 97 of List I and whether an affirmative answer to this question will render Entries I to 96 of List I otiose. One may sum up the discussion on the question of Parliament's legislative competence by saying that adopting Uthe construction most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude\" of powers conferred by the Constitution and interpreting the legislative entrif's in \"a broad and liberal spirit\", the impugned Act cannot be held to suffer from want of legislative competence in the Parliament to enact it. Entry 94 of List I, Entry 45 of List Ill and failing these, Entry 97 of List I must sustain the Act. 193. That disposes of points {a) to (e) set out above, leaving for consideration points {f), (g) and {h). For the sake of easy reference, these points may be summarised thus: {i) Administrative relations between the Union and the States are dealt with in Chapter II of Part XI of the Constitution; (ii) The Commissions of Inquiry Act, as interpreted above, purports to supplement the provisions contained in Chapter II, Part XI; (iii) Parliament cannot supplement any provision of the Constitution except by an amendment of the Constitution; (iv) The Commissions of Inquiry Act creates a new Centre-State relationship by vesting in the Central executive an added control over the State executive not provided for in the Constitution, and (v) Since the provisions contained in Chapter II of Part XI are exhaustive of matters governing the administrative relations between the Union and the States, any legislative addition thereto or supplementing thereof must be held to be impliedly prohibited. 19-t The short answer to the first four points, (i) to (iv) above, is that though it is true that administrative relations between the Union and the States are dealt with by Chapter II, Part XI of the Constitution and though the provisions contained t~e~ein cannot ~e altered save by a c<;m- stitutional amendment, the Comm1SS1ons of Inquiry Act does not bnng about any change in the Centre-State relationship as envisaged by Part XI. The Act merely empowers the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of collecting facts with a view to informing its own mind; and the report of the Cominission, not being binding on anyone, has no force of its own. Revelations before the Commission may con- ceivably produce an impact on the credibility of the State Government, but the inquiry is directed not to the manner in which the State Government or the State executive conducts itself in the discharge of its constitutional functions but to the manner in which, if at all, its Ministers have used their office as a cloak for committing acts of corruption and favouritism. It is possible that a Commission may accept the accusations against the Minister and in fairness emphasise that the private doings of the Minister have nothing to do with the public administration of the States' executive affairs. Indeed the Commission may reject the allegations as totally baseless and frivolo~s. These are all imponderables and they cannot influence the decision of basic question as to the nature of the Commissions' functions. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

However, it is necessary to say a word about the somewhat novel argument of the State Government that, by ordinary legislation, the Parliament cannot even ·supplement a constitutional provision, unless the Constitution expressly authorises it to do so. Ordinary legislation, as con- t.,ended by the learned Additional Solicitor-General, has to answer only two tests : Firstly, the law must be within the legislative competence of the Legislature, at'l.d secondly, the law must nut offend against the provisions of Part III or infringe any other specific provision of the Constitution. Once the legislative competence is established and no violation of any specific constitutional provision is made out, the validity of the Act cannot be assailed on the ground that it 'supplements' a constitutional provision. The fallacy of the State's argument consists in the assumption that every law \"in respect\" of a subject-matter dealt with by the Constitution amounts necessarily to an amendment of the Constitution. An illustration or two may help clarify the true position. Article 297 of the Constitution provides that all lands, minerals and ather things of value underlying the ocean within the territorial waters or the continental shelf of India shall vest in the Union and be held for the purposes of the Union. It is inarguable that since \"lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the ocean within the territorial waters or the continental shelf of India\" is the subject- matter of Article 297, no Legislature, even if it possesses legislative competence to do so, can legislate on that subject-matter. It is elementary that the Legislature cannot, while legislating on a topic enumerated in the relevant list, violate or infringe any provision of the Constitution. But so long as there is no such infringement, legislation on the subject dealt with by Article 297 cannot be declared unconstitutional on the ground that it supplements the provisions of that article. Article 299 of the Constitution deals with contracts. It seems to me equally inarguable that a legislation dealing with the subject-matter of contracts, even though not lacking in legislative competence, becomes unconstitutional for the reason that it deals with the subject-matter of contracts. The argument of the State in this behalf is therefore wholly devoid of substance, apart from the consideration that the impugned legislation does not bear on the Centre-State relationship. 196 The fifth and the last contention is also capable of being disposed of with the answer that the Commissions of Inquiry Act does not deal with the subject of Centre-State relations.hip, directly or indirectly. There is, therefore, no question of its creating a new relationship between the Union and the States not known to the Constitution or inconsistent with that provided for in Chapter II, Part XI of the Constitution. Not only that the pith and substance of the Act is \"Inquiries\", but it does not even incidentally encroach or trespass upon a constitutional field occupied by Part XI. If it does not touch the subject-matter of· Centre-State relation- ship, there is no question of its impinging upon a subject dealt with by the Constitution. Therefore, even assuming that legislation on the question of Centre-State relationship is impliedly barred, the impugned Act does not fall within the vice of that rule and cannot, therefore, be pronounced as unconstitutional. 197. All the same, it is necessary to examine briefly the validity of the State's contention that since the provisions in Chapter 11, Part XI are ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

J.) 105 exhaustive of matters governing the administrative relations between the Union and the States, any legislative addition thereto, or supplementing thereof, is impliedly prohibited. As already observed, if a law is within the legislative competence of the Legislature, it cannot be invalidated on the supposed ground that it has added something to, or has supplemented, a constitutional provision so long as the addition or supplementation is not inconsistent with any provision of the Constitution. I am, therefore, unable to appreciate the relevance of the State's reliance on the passage from Crau!ford's Statutory Construction (Ed. 1940, pages 334-335) to the effect that if a statute enumerates the things upon which it has to operate, every• thing else is necessarily and by implication excluded from its operation and its effect. As I have said more than once in my judgment, the one common thread which runs through the argument of the State is that the Constitution must be deemed to have impliedly prohibited the imposition of the control of the Central executive over the State executive except in emergencies, and since the Commissions of Inquiry Act transgresses that constitutional prohibition, it is void. The very assumption being unfounded, the supposed conseqm•nce has to be rejected. Besides, the doctrine of implied prohibition which is n·ecessarily based on the principle of inherent limitations has been rejected by this Court in the Fundamental Rights case'1 and in Shrimati Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj .Narain13• 198. I am, therefore, of the opinion that though the suit filed by the State of Karnataka is maintainable under Article 131 of the Constitution, the notification issued by the Government of India on May 23, 1977 is within the scope of Section 3( I) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, and that the Act is not unconstitutional for any of the reasons mentioned on behalf of the State Government. Accordingly, I agree respectfully with the conclusions reached by my Lord the Chief Justice in the case. ' BHAOWATI, J.

This article confers on the Supreme Court, sub- ject to the other provisions of the Constitution, exclusive original jurisdiction in any dispute-(a) between the Government of India and one or more States, or (b) between the Govetnment of India and any State or States on on~ side and one or more other States on the other, or (c) between two or more States, if and in so far as the dispute involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends. It is clear qn a plain reading of this article that it does not lay down any parti- cular mode of proceeding for exercise or the original jurisdiction conferred by it. No doubt, Part III of the Supreme Court Rul£s contemplates that the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under this article shall be invoked by means 'of a suit, but that is not the requirement of the article and in interpreting it, we should be careful not to allow our approach to be in- fluenced by considerations of 'cause of action' which are germane in a suit. The scope and ambit of the original jurisdiction must be determined on the plain terms of the article without being inhibited by any a priori considera- tions. 201. Now, plainly there are two limitations in regard to the dispute which can be brought before the Supreme Court under Article 131. One is in regard to parties and the other is in regard to the subject-matter. The article provides in so many terms that the dispute must be between the Government of India and one or more States or between two or more States. The object of the article seems to be that since in a federal or quasi-federal structure, which the Constitution seeks to set up, disputes may arise between the Government of India and one or more States, or between two or i;;nore States, a forum should be provided for the resolution of such disputes and that forum should be the highest Court in the land, so that final adjudication of such disputes could be achieved speedily and expeditiously without either party having to embark on a long, tortuous and time-consuming journey through a hierarchy of Courts. The article is a necessary concomitant of a federal or a quasi-federal form of Government and it is attracted only. when the parties to the dispute are the Government of India or one-or more States arrayed an either side. This is the limitation as to parties. The other limitation as to subject-matter flows from the words \"if and in so far as the dispute involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends\". These words clearly indicate that the dispute must be one affect- ing the existence or extent of a legal right and not a dispute on the political plane not involving a legal aspect. It was put by Chandrachud, J., very aptly in his judgment in the State of Rajasthan v. Union of India (supra) when he said : 11 Mere wrangles between Governments have no place under the scheme of that article .. \". It is only when a legal, as distinguished from a mere political, issue arises touching upon the existence or extent of a legal 'right that the article is attracted. Hence the suit in the present case would obviously not be maintainable unless it complies with both these limitations. 202. The contention or the learned Additional Solicitor General on behalf or the Union of India was that the test r or determining the maintain;. ability of the suit was not whether the right of the Central Government to set up a Commission of Inquiry against the Chief Minister and other Minis- ters of the State of Karnataka was questioned in the suit, but whether the impugned action of the Central Government infringed any legal right of the State.

UNION OF' INDIA (Bhagwotl, J.) 707 and I must assume it to be so in order to determine the maintainability of the suit-the question is as to whose legal right would be infringed: who would have a cause of action? Can the State say that its legal right is in- fringed and is, therefore, entitled to maintain the suit? The learned Addi- tional Solicitor General submitted that since the impugned action of the Central Government was directed against the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State, the legal right infringed would be that of the Chief Minister and the concerned Ministers and they would have a cause of action against the Union of India since they would be prejudicially affected by the executive action of the Central Government which is alleged to be in con- travention of the Constitution and the law. They have a legal right to im- munity from subjection to the unconstitutional exercise of power by the Central Government and this right can certainly be enforced by them. But that would be by way of a petition under Article 226 or Article 32, if a funda- mental right is involved, and not under Article 131. Even the State Govern- ment may be said to have a cause of action on the ground that the impugned actiQn of the Central Government affects its personnel, namely, the Chief Minister and other Ministers and the· State Government may legitimately claim to have sufficient intere.,t to ma~ntain a petition under Article 226 to challenge the impugned action. But it cannot file a suit under Article 131 because it is only the State which can maintain such a suit and not the State Government. The learned Additional Solicitor General contended that the expression ~ed in Article 131 is \"State,, and not \"State Govern- ment\" and there is a Jundamental distinction between \"State\" and \"State GovernmentH and it is, therefore, not enough to attract the applicability of Article 131 that the State Government should have a cause of action. It is the State whose legal right must be infringed and who must have a cause of action in order to invoke the jurisdiction under Article 131. The impugned action of the Central Government in the present case, argued the learned Additional Solicitor General, affects the legal right of the Chief Minister and the concerned Ministers and also possibly of the State Government, but it does not infringe the legal right of the State as a legal entity as distinct from the legal right of its executive agent, namely, the State Government and the State is, therefore, not entitled to maintain the suit under Article 131. This contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General is, in my opinion, not well founded and cannot be sustained. 203. There are two fallacies underlying the contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General. One is in drawing a rather rigid, water-tight distinction between \"State\" and \"State Government\" in the context of Article 131 and the other, in assuming that it is only where a legal right of the plaintiff is infringed that the suit can be maintained by the plaintiff under that article. Turning first to the distinction between \"State\" and \"State Gove, nment\", it is true that theoretically this distinction does exist and it finds recognition in sub-sections (58) and (60) of Section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. The majority judges in the State of Rajasthan v. Union of India also accepted that there is a distinction between \"State\" and \"State Government\". Willoughby points out in \"The Fundamental Concepts of Public Law,, at page 49 : \"The distinction between the State and its Government is analogous to that between a given human individual, as a moral and intellectual person, and his material physical body. By the term \"State\" is understood the political person or entity which possesse~ the law- making right. By the term \"Government\" is understood the agency through which the will of the State is formulated, expressed and executed.

And to the same effect are the observations of the United States Supreme Court in Poindexter v. Green- how :66 \"The State itself is an ideal person, intangible, invisible, and immutable. The Government is an agent. ... \". It w<;mld thus be seen that tht> State Government is the agent through which the State exercises its executive power. Now, if the State Government is the agent through which the State exp;-esses its will, it is difficult to see how the State can be said to be unconcerned when any right or capacity or lack of it is attributed to the State Government. It would be wholly unrealistic to suggest that since the State Govf'rnment is distinct from the State, any action or capacity or lack of it in the State Government would not affect the State and the State would not pe interested in it. This is to ignore the integral relationship between the \"State\" and the \"State Government\". Any action which affects the State Government or the Ministers in their capacity as Ministers-for in that capacity they would be acting on behalf of the State-would raise a matter in which the State would be concerned. It is true that analogies and metaphors are apt to mislead and it would be unsafe to base an argument upon them, but to reinforce what I have said, I may take the analogy given by Willoughby in the above quoted passage and ask the question : if any action or capacity or lack of it is attributed to the \"material physical body\", would it not be ascribable to the individual whose body it is and would he not be affected by it? I ag;ree with Or. Rajeev Dhavan and Prof. Alice Jacob when they say in their forthcoming article on the Assemb{y Dissolutjpn Case, nameiy, the State of Raiaslhan v. Union of India that : '' Any communication that is made to a Chie f Minister in his capacity as Chief Minister\" and equally to a Minister in his capacity as Minister, \"must create a matter which involves the State\". S. Murtaza Fazal Ali, J., in the State of Rajartlian v. Union of India sought to make a distinction between permanent institutions of the State and their changing personnel and observed: \"The question as to the personnel to run these institutions is wholly unrelatable to the existence of a dispute between the 'State' and the 'Government of India'. It is only when there is a com- plete abolition of any of the permanent institutions of a State that a real dispute may arise\". I do not think that this is a valid distinction for deter- mining when a dispute can be said to be one with the State as distinct from the persons constituting the State Government. To quote again from the forthcoming article of Dr. Raj eev Dhavan and Prof. Alice Jacob: \"The hair-splitting distinction cannot be between the permanent institutions of the State and the non-pr>rman ent institutions of the State; nor can it be between actions which limit the powers of the officials of the Government of a State and those that abolish the institutions of the State. The hair-splitting dis- tinction is between those actions which can be attributed to the State or any official thereof and those actions which are personal and not ascribed to the officials in their capacity ac; officials of the State-A letter sent to the Chief MinistPr questioning his capacity or power to rule as Chief Minister may not allege lack of confidence in the Chief Minister as person, wife, husband, father or friend. It alleges lack of confidence in the Chief Minister in his capacity as Chif'f Minister\". I find myself in agreement with this opinion and I wholly endorsP it. I would, therefore, hold that when any right or capacity or lack of it is attributed to any institution or person acting on be- half of the State, it raises a matter in which the State is involved or con- cerned. The State would, in the circumstances, be affected or at any rate interested, if the Chief Minister and other Ministers in their capacity as such, or to put it diffe.rently, in the matter of discharge of their official functions, 55. 29 Law Ed 185 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

If the Central Government were to issue a direction to the Chief Minister and other Ministers to exereise the executive power of the State m a particular manner, the State would be clearly affected if such direction is uncorutitutional and would be entitled to complain against it. Then is the position any different, if the Central Government, instea.d, proceeds, without any constitutional authority, to inquire how the executive power of the State is exercised by the Chjef Minister and other Ministers and whether it is exercised in a proper manner. The State would clearly in such a case have locus to challenge the unconstitutional action of the Central Govern- ment. 204. It may also be noted that, on a proper construction of Article 131, it is not necessary that the plaintiff should have some legal right of . its own to enforce, before it can institute a suit under that article. lt is not a sine qua non of the applicability of Article I 31 that there should be infringement of some legal right of the plaintiff. What Article 131 requires is that the dispute must be one which involves a question \"on which the existence or extent o( legal right depends\". The article does not say that the legal right must be of the plaintiff. It may be \"of the plaintiff or of the defendant. What is necessary is that the existence or extent of the legal right must be in issue in the dispute between the parties. We cannot construe Article 131 as confined to cases where the dispute relates to the existence or extent of the legal right of the plaintiff, for to do so, would be to read words in . the article which are not there. It seems that because the mode of proceeding provided in Part III of the Supreme Court Rules for bringing a dispute before the Supreme Court under Article 131 is a suit, that we are unconsciously influen- ced to import the notion of \"cause of action\", which is germane in a suit, in the interpretation of ~rticle 131 a~d !o ~e':'-d t~is article as limited only to cases where some legal nght of the plamt1ff 1S mfrmged and consequently, it has a \"cause of action\" against the defendant. But it must be remembered that there is no reference to a suit or \"cause of action\" in Article 131 and that article confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court with reference to the character of the dispute which may be brought before it for adjudication. The requirement of \"cause of action\", which is so necessary in a suit, can- not, therefore, be imported while construing the scope and ambit of Article 13 l. It is no doubt true that the judgment delivered by me in the State of Rajas than v. Union of India proceeds on the assumption that a suit under Arti- cle 131 can be instituted only if some right of the plaintiff is infringed, but there was no proper discussion of this question in the course of the arguments in that case and on fuller consideration, I think that no such restriction can be imported in the construction of Article l 31 so as to narrow down the ambit and coverage of that article. The only requirement necessary for attracting the applicability of Article 131 is that the dispute must be one in- volving any question \"on which the existence or extent of a legal right\" depends, irrespective of whether the legal right is claimed by one party or the other and it is not necessary that some legal right of the plaintiff should be infringed before a suit can be brought under that article. The plaintiff must of course be a party to the dispute and obviously it cannot be a party to the dispute unless it is affected by it. The plaintiff cannot raise a dispute in regard to a matter which does not affect it or in which it is not concerned. It cannot act as a mere busybody interfering with things which do not con- cern it. But if the plaintiff has interest in raising the dispute in the sense that it is affected by the action taken, it can bring the dispute before the Supreme Court under Article 131, even if no legal right of its is infringed, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It would also be convenient at thia stage to consider what ii the meaning of the expreuion \"legal right\" as used in Article 13 I. It is obvious that the word 'right' ii used here in a generic sense and not according to it& strict meaning. 'Right' ia its narrow sense constitutes the correlative of duty, but in its generic sense it includes not only right stricto sen.su, but \"any advan- tage or benefit conferred upon a person by a rule of law\". bias in his Juris- prudence, 1976 Ed., pages 33-34, says that the word 'right' has unde~gone successive shifts in meaning and Hohfeld in his \"Fundamental Legal Concepts as Applied to Legal Reasoning\" gives four different meanings of the word 'right'. One is right slricto s,nsu, the other is liberty, the third is power and the fourth is immunity. In ita strict sense 'right' is defined as interest which the law protects by imposing corresponding duty on others. 'Liberty' is exemption from the right of 'another and its correlative is 'no-right' and in the same way 'power' is ability to change the legal relations of another and its corre- lative is liability. Similarly, 'immunity' is exemption from the legal power of another and the correlati~e of immunity is disability. To illustrate, where there is a right stricto smsu in A, there is a correlative duty in B to do X. Similarly, where A has liberty ·to do X, there is a correlative no-right in B to interfere in regard to it. The correlative of power in A is liability in Bas regards X and similarly, where there is immunity in A from the legal power of B, its correlative is disability in B as regards X. These are the four different jural relationships recognised b.y law and they are comprehended within the generic term 'right'. Now, there can be no doubt that the word 'right' ia used in Article 13.l in this generic sense. If, for example, the State claims' to be entitled to legislate exclusively on a particular matter on the ground that it falls within List II of the VII Schedule to the Constitution and the Union of India questions this right of the State, the dispute would be one relating, not to any right of the State in the strict sense of the term, but to the 'liberty' of the State to legislate on such matter and it would come directly within the terms of Article 131. Even a dispute relating to the power of the Union of India to abolish the Legislative Assembly of a State or to dissolve it would fall within the scope and ambit of Article 131 as held expressly by Chandrachud, J., Gupta, J., and myself and impliedly by Beg, C. J., in the Stal, of Rajasthan v. Union of India. What has, therefore, to be seen in order to determine the applicability of Article 13 l is whether there is any relational legal matter involving a right, liberty, power or immunity qua the parties to the dispute. If there is, the suit would be maintainable, but not otherwise. 206. The question which arises for consideration on this interpretation of Article 13 l is whether there is any dispute between the State of Karnataka and the Union of lndia involving a question as to the existence or extent of a relational legal pattern within the generic sense of the term 'right'. It is true that it may not be possible to say that by reason of the impugned action of the Central Government in setting up a Commissi9n of Inquiry against the Chief Minister and other Ministers who constitute the State Government any legal right of the State is infringed, but, as already pointed out above: it is not necessary, in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 13 r, that the State should be able to show that some legal right of its is breached. It is enough to show that the State is interested, not as a busybody or as a meddlesome interloper, but in a real sense in questioning the power of the Central Government to set up such Commission of Inouirv. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

UNION OP INDIA (Bhagwati, J.) 71 l If we look at the averments in the plaint, and for the purpose of deterniining the question of jurisdiction we mwt proceed on the assumption that the averments are correct, it is clear that according to the claim made by the State, the Legislature of the State and the State Government alone have power to inve11tigate and control misuse of ·governmental power by the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State and the Centr;il Government has no power to inquire into the same or to set up a Commission of Inquiry for that purpose. This claim of the State clearly raises a dispute u to the extent of the power of the State and the existence or a superior or coordinate power in the Central Government to inquire into the conduct of the Chief Minister and other Miniatera of the State in the discharge or their govern- mental functions. Such a dispute concern■ the content of the respective powers of the State and the Union of India and the inter se relationship between the two entities and the State is vitally interested in it. The State is very much concerned whether the conduct of its Council of Ministers in the discharge of governmental functions can be inquired into only by itself through its own agency or it can alao be 1ubjected to scrutiny by the Union of India. The State would certainly have locus to say that the Union of India has no right to encroach upon its e~clusive power to investigate into misuse of governmental power by its Council of Ministers. There can be no doubt that, apart from its Council of Ministers, the State_ can also compe- tently make a claim that the Council of Ministen acting on its behalf is immune from subjection to the power of the Central Government to inquire into their conduct as Ministers. This immunity claimed in respect of the Council of Ministers can be ascribed to the State and it can certainly raise a dispute touching upon the existence of this immunity. So far as dispute as to the scope of respective legislative fields between the Commonwealth and the States in Australia is concerned, it is now well settled as a result of the decision in .Attorn,y General for Victoria v. The Commonwealth,.. that the Attorney General of a State can sue for a declaration of the invalidity of Federal legis- lation as an inva11ion of a purely State field of legislative power and similarly the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth can sue a State in order to obtain a declaration of the invalidity of State legislation where it encroachea upon the legislative power entrusted to the Commonwealth. The High Court of Australia pointed out in this case that the position wu correctly summarised by Gavan Duffy, C. J., Evatt and Me Tiernan, JJ. in .A1torney- G1neralfor Victoria v. The Commonw,alt~7 in the following words: \"It must now be taken as established that the Attorney-General of a State of the Commonwealth has a sufficient title to invoke the provisions of the Consti• tution for the purpose of challenging the validity of Commonwealth legisla- tion which extends to, and operates within, the State whose interests he re- present&\". Now, if a State has sufficient title to challenge the validity of Union legislation on the ground that it interferes with the exercise of State legislative power, it must follow a fortiori that the State would have locus to challenge unconstitutional exercise of power by the Central Government which encroaches upon its exclusive sphere in relation to the conduct of its Council of Ministers. The State would also be entitled to challenge the im- pugned action of the Central Government as unconstitutional, because it prevents the State from exercising its power to direct inquiry into matten which are specified in the notification issued by the Central Government, by reason of proviso (a) to sub-section ( 1) of Section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952.

Since, l-owever, the claim made by the State in the suit is not sustainable on merits as pointed out by my learned brother Chandrachud in has judgment, I agree w1th him that the suit should be dismissed with costs. UNTWALIA, J. (concurring, for himself, Shinghal and Jaswant Singh, JJ.)- We agree that this suit should be dismissed with costs. We however regret our inability to concur in the view expressed by Bhagwati, J., in regard to the maintainability of the suit under Article 131 of the Consti- tution. For the reasons stated hereinafter we have come to the conclusion that the suit is not maintainable. We have also briefly discussed and decided the other issues in the suit on merits. While generally agreeing respectfully with the leading judgment of the learned Chief Justice, we think it advisable to add a few pages by way of our concurring note. 209. The first issue in this suit is: \"Is the suit maintainable?\" 210. Although the decision of this issue is interlinked with the other issues settled for adjudication, it can be dealt with separately also. 211. What, in substance, · is this suit filed under Article 13 l of the Constitution of India? Certain allegations of corruption, nepotism, and favouritism, in relation to the administrative actions of the Chief Minister and some other Ministers of the State of Kamataka were made by some legislators of that State. A memorandum signed by 46 legislators of the State containing the allegations was forwarded to the C entral Government. Its Home Minister in his letter dated April 26, 1977, requested the Chief Minister to give information and his comments apropos the allegations made. The Chief Minister, in his reply letter dated May 13, 1977, inter alia, challenged the authority of the Central Government to call for an explanation and make any inquiry in the matter. He claimed that it was the exclusive right of the State to do so. It seems, to forestall the appointment of any Commission of Inquiry by the Central Government, the State Government hastened to issue a notification on May 18, 1977 to set up some kind of inquiry in respect of the allegations made, although, in terms the inquiry was not specifically in relation to the various charges of misconduct and maladministration made against the Chief Minister and the other Ministers. The notification was issued by the State Government under Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 (Central Act 60 of 1952) (hereinafter to be referred to as the Act). Shri Justice Mir Iqbal Hussain, a retired Judge of the Karnataka High Court, was appointed as the sole member of the Commission of Inquiry by the State Government. Five days later, on May 23, 1977, the Ce~ttral Government, in exercise of their power under Section 3 of the Act, appointed another Commission consisting of a single member, namely, Shri Justice A. N. Grover, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India, to inquire into the various allegations specified in Annexures 'I' and 'II' to the notification excluding, however, from the latter-\"any matter covered by the notification of the Government of Karnataka in the Chief Secretariat No. DPAR 7 GAN 77, dated May.18, 197 J\". Thereupon the State of Karnataka filed the persent suit claiming certain reliefs mainly on two grounds: (1) On a proper interpretation of the Act the State Government is the appropriate Government and not the Central Government to set up a Commission of Inquiry; and (2) in the alternative the provisions in the Act in so far as they authorise the Central Government to issue the impugned notification are ultra vires the Consti- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The contest is by the first defendant only and hereinafter in this judgment it will be referred to as the defendant. In substance and effect the claim of the defendant is that it has got the legal right to issue the impugned notification; the rigl;it conferred by Section 3 of the Act iis not ultra vires the Constitution. The right of the State of Karnataka to institute the suit under Article 131 is challenged mainly on the ground that the nature of the dispute in the suit is such that it does not affect any legal right of the State. 212. Under Article I of the Constitution, India is a Union of States. The State of Karnataka is one of the constituent units of the Union of India. The concept of State is that by itself it is an ideal person, a legal entity. It is intangible, invisible 11nd immutable. The Government, in a sense, ~ an agency through which the will of the State is formulated, expressed and executed. Both the expressions have been separately defined in the General Clauses Act, 1917. In relation to the existence of a dispute between the Union of India on the one hand and one or more States on the other, the expression used in Article 13 ~ for the former is the Government of India, signifying that the dispute may be with the Government of India but the other party to the dispute must be the State only and not any limb of the State- tlie Government, the Legislature or the Judiciary. Article 300 is an enabling provision to describe the Government of India in a suit as the Union of India and to enable the Government of a State to sue or be sued in the name of the State. If there is an invasion on the legal right of a State the agency through which the action will be commenced may well be the Government of the State. An inroad upon the right of the Government may, in certain circumstances, be an inroad upon the legal right of the State. Article 300, therefore, merely prescribes the mode of describing a party to the suit. The real answer to the question of maintainability, however, has got to be found from the words of Article 131 itself. The following conditions must exist for invoking the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under the said article: (1) (2) The dispute must be between the Government of India and one or more States or between two or more States; and The dispute must involve any question whether of law or of fact on which the existence or extent of the legal right depends. 213. There is some departure in this regard from the corresponding provision of Section 204 of the Government of India Act, 1935 which is not necessary to be pin-pointed here. In specific terms it has not been stated in the article as to whose legal right the question involved in the dispute must relate and in what respect. Chandrachud, J., in this regard has expressed his opinion in the case of State of Rajasthan v. Union of lndia68 at page 1396 (SCC p. 639, para 112) as follows: , It is sufficient in order that its provisions may apply that the plaintiff questions the legal or constitutional right asserted by the defendant, be it the Government of India or _any other State. The learned Chief Justice in his leading judgment did not del:ide this question. The other five Judges including one of us (Untwalia, J.) took a contrary view. Yet, Bhagwati and Gupta, JJ. on the facts of that case held that the legal right of the State, the plaintiff, had been infringed. The 58.

If we may say so with great respect, we are unable to agree with the view aforesaid, expressed by Chandrachud, J. Ordinarily and generally, in any suit including the one under Article 131 the competition is between the legal right of the plaintiff and the defendant. But primarily, and almost invariably, the plaintiff has to establish his legal right in order to succeed in the suit. As against the claim of the plaintiff, if the legal right of the defendant is established, the suit is bound to fail. But on failure of either to establish his own legal right, the suit will still fail because the plaintiff cannot succeefl unless he establishes his legal right. This proposition of law is so clear and axiomatic that the expression-\"the existence or extent of a legal 'right\"-used in Article 131 undoubtedly is meant to bring about this result. It was neither necessary, nor perhaps advisable, to state further in the article that the dispute must involve any ques1!ion on which the legal right of the plaintiff must depend. It is matter of common experience that more often than not absence of a legal right in one party helps the other party to establish its legal right and vice versa. 2H. In the case of King-Emperor v. Sibnalh Ban4rji\" Lord Thankerton opined at page 266 that \"a Minister is an officer subordinate to the Governor within the meaning of the Government of India Act, 1935\". The same view was expressed by Hegde, J ., in the case of A. Sanjeeui Naidu v. State of Madras'° with reference to the provisions of the Constitution. 215. In the present case the inquiry set up by the Central Government is not against the State or the State Government. It is against the Chief Minister and some other Ministers who are officers of the State. It may be open. to them to take the plea in an appropriate proceeding, such as a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, that the action of the Central Government is illegal and ultra vires. Under Article 131A (introduced by the Forty-second Amendment), the question of vires of Section 3 of the Act may then have to be referred for the decision for the Supreme Court by the High Court. But that in no way entitled the State to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 131. The submission made by Mr. Lal Narayan Sinha on behalf of the plaintiff State that the legal right of the State has been invaded by the impugned notification, is not correct. Counsel submitted that it is only the State's right to order an inquiry under Section 3 of the Act against its Ministers acting through its Government, that the Central Government has no right, that it has put an impediment in the right of the State Government to modify or issue a subsequent notification for the purpose of enlarging or clarifying the scope of the inquiry and that it has thus affected the legal right of the State. We find no substance in thia argument. There may be a competition between the power of one authority and the other, here in this case between the Central Government and the State Government. But unless the power exercised by one authority brings apout a dispute impinging upon the legal right of the other authority, the latter cannot come under Article 131 and say that merely because it was within its power to do so its legal right is affected by the illegal exercise of the power by the other authority. The said exercise of the power must directly or by necessary implication affect the legal right of the other authority. We may support the proposition by an illustration.

The order will be obviously bad, aa having been issued under an invalid law made by the Parliament. Who can chal- lenge this order? Obvioualy the penon affected or aggrieved by the order.. If the order does not aff~t the legal .right of the State or the State Government (for the purpose of testing the argument, the two may be equated), can the State file a suit under Article 13 I merely because the order has been made against its resident in accordance with a law which encroachP-d upon the exclusive legislative field of the State? The answer, in our opinion, must be in the negative. In the instant case if the stand on merits taken on behalf of the State Ministers ia correct, then the impugned notification is an invasion on their legal right. They can press into service the power of the State Government to order an inquiry and challenge the impugned notification, but the said notification can in no way be said to have affected or restrained the State Government from giving effect to ita notification. 216. Some help may be derived from the definition of the word \"State\" given at pages 856-57 of Vol. 81, Corpus Juris Secundum. It says: The word 'State' has various meanings, but as used in the federal Constitution, acts of Congress, and State statutes, it has a definite, fixed, and certain legal meaning as designating a member of the Union in contradistinction to the United States as a nation . . . . The State is a legal entity, and is entitled to the fundamental rights, privileges, and immunities belonging to every legal entity. If a restricted meaning were not to be given to the scope of the suit which can be filed under ArticJe 131, very anomalous, and sometimes absurd, results may follow and it will be difficult to put a dividing line and a stop to the veny wide scope of the suit resulting from such an interpretation. Any action taken by the Central Government either under the Act or other- wise, against any citizen residing in, or an officer of, the State could be challenged by institution of a suit under Article l 31 by the State on the ground that the action of the Central Government is ultra vires and without any legal right. The argument that the State is interested in protecting its people and officers when their legal right has been illegally invaded by the Central Government and, therefore, it has a locus to invoke Article 131, in our opinion, is too obviously wrong to be accepted. 217. As we have said above, a Minister is an officer of the State. An order affecting him cannot confer a right of suit on the State under Article 131. So the present suit, in our opinion, is not maintainable. We, however, do not propose to non-suit the plaintiff on that ground alone, and proceed to discuss the other issues. 218. The other two issues framed for consideration in this. suit are in the following terms : \"2. Is the impugned notification ultra vires the powers of the Central Government under Section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act? 3. If Section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act authorises the Central Government to issue the impugned notification. is the section itself unconstitutional?

Mr. Soli Sorabjee, the learned Additional Solicitor General, combated the arguments of the plaintiff very ably and succinctly. Eventually, the main points of attack of the plaintiff were crystallized in the following terms : (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) Our Constitution is of a federal character clearly defining and dividing the legislative and the executive functions of the Centre and the States and their inter se relationship. The judicial functions of the Judiciary are in a well-defined and demarcated separate compartment. Except to the extent permitted by the Constitution the Centre cannot encroach upon the legislative or executive field of the State. The Act does not and cannot authorise the Centre to set up a Commission of Inquiry against the State executive; Section 3 must be read down to save it from being constitutionally invalid. If it be not possible to read down the Act in the manner suggested then the Act is invalid in so far as it authorises the ·Centre to set up a Commission of Inquiry against the State executive. Such a law is beyond the legislative competence of the Union Parliament as in substance and in effect it violates either expressly or by necessary implication certain provisions of the Constitution, its basic scheme, or the fundamental back-bone of the Centre- State relationship as enshrined in the Constitution. The law having the effect as aforesaid will really be a· constitu- tional law bringing about an amendment in the Constitution which is obviously not permissible; an ordinary legislation unless expressly permitted by the provision of the Constitution cannot in any way amend the Constitution. The Act is beyond the legislative competence of the Central Parliament if it means authorisation by the Central Government of any machinery for making inquiries in the executive actions of the State Government or the Chief Minister or any other Minister either collectively or individually. Strictly speaking the subject-matter of the present inquiry is not covered by the Act if it be held that it has been enacted in exercise of the power of the Parliament under Entry 94 of List I, Entry 45 of List III or the Residuary Entry 97 of List I read with Article 248 of the Constitution. La-stly it was also submitted that the scope of the two inquiries one set up by the State Government and the other by the Central Government are more or less the same. Almost all matters of inquiry are overlapping and, therefore, the impugned notification is bad on that account too. 219. We proceed to discuss and consider briefly, as far as possible, the propositions aforesaid, but not strictly in the order we have set out above. 220.

It is because of that reason that sometimes it has been characterised as quasi-federal in nature. Leaving the functions of the Judiciary apart, by and large the legislative and the executive functions of the Centre and the States have been defined and distributed, but, even so, through it all runs an overall thread or rein in the hands of the Centre in both the fields. The Parliament has the exclusive authority to legislate on matters enumerated in List I. So has the State Legislature the exclusive legislative power with respect to the various entries in List II. Both have concurrent powers in regard to the entries of List III. The residuary power in accordance with Article 248 and Entry ~7 of List I, lies with the Central Parliament. It has got a predominant hand in respect of the matters in the Concurrent List as is apparent from Article 254. Article 249 confers power on Parliament to legislate with respect to a matter in the State List, in the national interest. When a proclamation of emer- gency is in operation as provided for in Article 250, the Parliament has got the power to legislate with respect to any matter in the State List. Some inroad in the State legislative field by the Centre is permiss;ble under circumstances mentioned in Articles 252 and 253. As provided for in Article 254 in some situations, the State is under an obligation to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the Presid~nt and receive his assent before it is made in to a law. %21. \"It shall be the duty of the Union to protect every State against external aggression and internal disturbance and to ensure that the Government of every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitu- tion\". (Vide Article 355, emphasis supplied). In case of failure of the constitutional machinery in States, provision has been made in Article 356 for the Centre to assume legislative and executive powers but not the powers vested in or exercisable by a High Court of a State. The effect of proclama- tion of an emergency under Article 352 is to enlarge the executive power of the Union and extend it to the giving of direction to any State as to the manner in which the executive power thereof is to be exercised as provided for in Article 353. There could not have been, for obvious reasons, any such provision in regard to the administration of the Centre. 222. The administrative relations between the Centre and the State are by and large governed by the provisions of Chapter II of Part XI of the Constitution. While providing in Article 256 that \"the ex:-cutive power of every State shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that State\", it is signifi- cant to note that it has further been engrafted therein that \"executwe power of the Union &hall extend to the giving of such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for that purpose\". The control of the Union over the States in certain cases has been provided for in Article 257. Mr. Sinha pointedly referred to Article 258A introcluced in the Constitution by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, to lenli support to his argument. But, in our opinion, instead of strengthening the point as urged, it weakens it because the said Article provides : 258A. Power of the States to entrustfumtions to the Union.-Notwith- standing anything in the Constitution, the Governor of a State may, with the consent of the Government of India, entrust either conditionally or unconditionally to that Government or to its officers functions in relation to any matter to which the executive power of the State extends. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

We may now refer to some other characteristics and features of our Constitution to demonstrate the weak character or our federal structure and the controlling hand of the Centre on States in certain matters. Some of the salient ones are the following : l. The Governor of a State is appointed by the President and holds office at his pleasure. Only in some matters he has got a discre- tionary power but in all others the State administration is carried .on by him or in his name by or with the aid and advice of the Ministers. Every action, even of an individual Minister, is the action of the whole Council and is governed by the theory of joint and collective responsi- bility. But the Governor is there, as the head of the State, the Executive and the Legislature, to report to the Centre about the administration of the State. 2. Makin~ a departure from the corresponding provision in the Go~ernment of India Act, Entry 45 in List III of the Seventh Schedule empowers the Parliament to legislate on the subject of \"inquiries ... for the purpose of any of the matters specified in List II\" also besides List III, and List I as mentioned in Entry 94 of that List. The consti- tuent power of amendment of the Constitution lies with the Parliament under Article 368 providing for concurrence by half the number of the States in certain matters. 3. Article 2 empowers the Parliament by law to admit into the Union, or establish, new States on such terma and conditions as it thinks ' fit. 4. Parliament is also empowered by Article 3 to make law for the formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or nam~s of existing States. Such is the nature _of our federal structure. 224. In State of West Bengal v. Union of India11 in the· majority judgment delivered by B. P. Sinha, C. J., the character and nature of our federal structure has been discussed from pages 396 onwards. The learned Chief Justice observed at page 397 that in our Constitution the Supreme authority of the Courts to interpret the Constitution and to invalidate action violative of the Constitution is to be found in full force. \"The exercise of powers legislative and executive in the allotted fields is hedged in by numerous restrictions, so that the powers of the States are not coordinate with the Union and are not in many respects independent\". At page 398 it is observed: \"The political sovereignty is distributed between, as we will presently demonstrate, the Union of India and the States with greater weightage in favour of the Union\". 225. If any article of the Constitution in terms permits the Centre to encroach upon the legislative and the ,executive field of the State, as some of the articles do, then there could be no doubt that the encroachment is perfectly legal and valid. If, however, either the law or the action taken under it makes an inroad on the executive power of the State in express violation of any provision of the Constitution or, even assuming, as was 61.

UNION OF INDIA (Untwalia, J.) 719 arg~d by Mr. Sinha, violating the provisions of the Constitution by neces- sary implication, then such a law or the action taken thereunder would be invalid. The Constitution does not permit the Centre to violate it in any matter. 226. But in order to appreciate as to whether the Act or the action taken by the Centre under Section 3 thereof has gone against the Constitution either expressly or by necessary implication, one has to appreciate the nature of the provisions made and the scope and functions of the Commission in question. The extent of the executive power of the Union is co-extensive with the legislative power of the Parliament. The position in respect of the executive power of the State is identical (vide Articles 73 and 162 respec- tively). Entry 94 in the Union List empowers the Parliament to legislate concernin~ inquiries for the purpose of any of the matters in that List, that is to say, if any kind of inquiry is necessary for any kind of purpose connected with any of the matters in List I then the Parliament is empowered to make a law for the setting up of a machinery or a tribunal for the purpose of the said inquiry. List II does not contain any such entry. Then comes Enrry 45 in List III which has already been alluded to. This authorises both the Central and the State LegislatureA·, of course subject to the other provisions of the Constitution 1. g. Article 254, to enact law for the purpose of providing for the machinery of inquiry for the purposes· of any of the matters specified in List II and List III. It has been so held in the case of Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justic1 S. R. Tendolkar• where Das, C. J. has lucidly discussed the matter, if we say so with great respect, at pages 289- 291. 227. Empowering the Central Legislature to make a law for the purpose of inquiry in regard to the matters specified in List II is in no sense empower- ing it to legislate vis-a-vis such matters. It is only for the purpose of achieving the object of the inquiry to be set up in regard to the matters enumerated in List II. The purpose may be as a matter of policy in relation to the legislation proposed to be passed by the various States or may be with regard to their executive actions taken apropos such matters. We may just illustrate our view by referring to Entry 6 of List II. The State Legialature has the exclusive authority to legislate on \"public health and sanitation; hospitals and dispensaries\"; of course, within the territory of that State. The executive power being co-extensive, the hospitals may be established and doctors appointed therein by the State Government either in accordance with the law made in that regard or even in pure exercise of the executive power. If there has been corruption, nepotism, favouritism or maladminis- tration in connection with the said executive action of the State Government, the law made under Entry 45 of the Concurrent List can undoubtedly cover an inquiry in such matters. It neither interferes with the legislative power of the State nor with its executive action. A mere inquiry under the Act by a Commission appointed thereunder which is a fact-finding body t is for the purpose of finding the facts. Nobody is a prosecutor; nobody is an accused; all are invited and welcomed by the Commission to assist it to find the neces- sary facts within the scope of the inquiry set up. 228. In passing we may also refer to Entry 8 of List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. It is in respect of \"Central Bureau of Intelli- gence and Investigation\". The Central Parliament is therefore competent to legislate on this topic and the Central Government can make an executive 62. 1959 SCR 279: AIR J958 SC 538 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

If that be so, will it be reasonable to say that the Commission appointed by the Central Government under the Act cannot be appointed for finding facts in relation to the allegations made against the Minister of a State? Obviously not. 229. It was strenuously submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that no such fact-finding Inquiry Commission could be set up against the Judiciary either Subordinate or Higher . Reference was made to the cases of The State of West Bengal v. Nripendra Nath Bagchi63, and Shamsher Singh v. State of Panjab\" in support of this proposition. But the exclusion of the inquiry under the Act against the Judiciary is based on entirely different principles. So far as the Subordinate Judiciary is concerned, inquiry of this nature will be imper- missible on the basis of the express language of Article 235 as interpreted by this Court in the two cases referred to above and in various others. The setting up of such an inquiry against a High Court Judge or a Supreme Court Judge will be barred because of the comtitutional provisions contained in clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 read with Article 218. As a matter of fact in accordance with clause (5) of Article 124 the Parliament has enacted the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968 (Act 51 of 1968). 230. As already pointed out, in an inquiry set up under the Act there is no prosecution, no framing of a formal charge, no accused before the Commission of Inquiry. There is no exercise of any supervisory or dis- ciplinary jurisdiction by the Central Government against the State Govern- ment by the appointment of a Commission, nor is there any usurpation of any executive function of the State. Reference in this connection may be made to the following cases: (l) M. V. Rajwade v. Dr. S. M. Hassan66 ; (2) Brajnandan ·Sinha v. Jyoti Narain68 ; (3) Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v . Shri Justice S . R. Tendolkar (supra); (4) State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad67 ; (5) P. V. Jagannath Rao v. State of Orissa68 and (6) Krishna Ballabh Sahay v . Commission of Enquiry69 • The Centre, however, must be and is concerned with and interested in knowing and ascertaining facts as regards the allegations made against any Chief Minister, Minster or any other officer of the State Government. 231. Now let us proceed to examine the matter a bit more carefully with reference to the other arguments of Mr. Lal Narayan Sinha. Counsel submitted that neither the Council of Ministers nor any individual Miniilter is under the disciplinary control of the Central Government. Setting up of a Commission of Inquiry to find facts in relation to the alleged misconduct or maladministration of the Ministers is, in substance and effect, an exercise of disciplinary control over them. He further submitted that the State Legislature to whom the Ministers are responsible is competent to set up an inquiry against them in accordance with the p<'wers and privileges as provided for in Article 194. It may be so. It may well be, as further argued by Mr. Sinha, that not only the State Legislature but the State Government itself is competent ~o appoint a Commission of Inquiry against 63. 64. 65. 66. {1966) I SCR 771: AIR 1966 SC 447: (1968) 1 Lab LJ 270 ( 1975) 1 SCR 814 : (1974) 2 sec 831 : 1974 sec (L & S) 550 ILR 1954 Nag I : AIR 1954 Nag 71 (1955) 2 SCR 955: AIR 1956 SC 66: 67. 68. 69. 1956 Cri LJ 156 1966 Supp SCR 401: AIR 1967 SC 122 (1968) 3 SCR 789: AIR 1969 SC 215 (1969) I SCR 387: AIR 1969 SC 258: 1969 Cri LJ 520 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

But it sounds incongruous and highly anomalous that the State Government would think of instituting an inquii; against itself. It is equally strange to think that the Ministers in power, while remaining in office, would set up a Commission of Inquiry for inquiring into their alleged misdeeds in the matter of administration of the State. We shall assume for the purpose of argument that legally and technically the position is correct . Even so, how does it lead to the conclusion that their power is exclusive and excludes the power of the Central Government under the Act? We fail to find any words in any of the articles of the Constitution to indicate that the power of the State Legislature or the State Governmen'. in this matter is exclusive. It may be co-extensive, and such a situation i, undoubtedly postulated and provided for in the proviso appended to sub- section ( l) of Section 3 of the Act. Although technically and literally the Ministers are appointed by the Governor and hold office at his pleasure, in reality, in the constitutional set up of our parliamentary democracy, the Governor in his discretion cannot by himself set up a Commi.ision of Inquiry against the sitting Ministers, nor can the President direct hi:m to do so- emergency provisions in Part XVIII apart. What then excludes the power of the Central Government to set up a Commission of Inquiry for finding facts in regard to the alleged maladministration of the Ministers or officers of a particular State Government? After ascertainment of facts, further action may follow or be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution or the law. But surely the Act does not, nor could it, provide for any kind of disciplinary action such as removal or suspension of a Minister in.office by the Centre on ascertainment of the truth of the alleged facts against him- provisions in the Emergency Chapter apart. If it were otherwise undoub- tedly it will be encroaching upon the power of the State Government or the State Legislature. India is a single country as a whole. The nation is one and one alone. Leaving aside the special provisions of Article 370 in relation to the State of J ammu and Kashmir, there is no dual citizenship; there are no different nationalities . ~ · 232. While assailing the impugned notification Mr. Lal Narayan Sinha has strenuously contended that Article 164(2) of the Constitution which makes the Council of Ministers collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State indicates that a Minister is in no other way responsible, answerable or accountable for anything that he does while in office and he cannot be subjected to _an inquiry undPr the Commissions of Inquiry Act. This contention is based on a misconception of the true import and meaning of the doctrine of collective responsibility and as such cannot be countenanced. The following discussion on the subject in \"Representatiue and Responsible Gouernment\" by A. H. Birch will be found useful in this connection: Ministerial accountability to Parliament has two aspects : the collective respansibility of Ministers for the policies of the Government and there individual responsibility for the work of their departments. Both forms of responsibility are embodied in conventions which cannot be legally enforced. Both conventions were developed during the nineteenth century, and in both cases the practice was established before the doctrine was announced (page 131). 233. In \"Government and Law\" by T. C. Hartley and J. A. C. Griffith, the position in regard to the collective responsibility of Ministers to the Legislature is tersely stated as under : Ministers are said to be collectively responsible.

Ordinarily, Ministers form the governmental team, all being appointed by the Prime Minister from one political party. A Cabinet Minister deals with his own area of policy and does not normally have much to do with the area of other Ministers. Certainly no Cabinet Minister would be likely to make public statements which impinged on the work of another Minister's department. On a few important issues, policy is determined by the Cabinet after discussion. Collective responsibility means that Cabinet ·decisions bind all Cabinet Ministers, even if they argued in the opposite direction in Cabinet. But this is to say no more than a Cabinet Minister who finds himself in a minority must either accept the majority view or resign. The team must not be weakened by some of its members making clear in public that they disapprove of the Government's pplicy. And obviously what is true for Cabinet Ministers is even more true for other Ministers. If they do not like what the team is doing, they must either keep quiet or leave (page 60). 234. Dealing with the collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Legislative Assembly of the State, Sarkar, C. J., speaking for the Court said at page 405 as follows in State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad70• Section 3771 talks of collective responsibility of Ministers to the Legislative Assembly. That only means that the Council of Miniaters will have to stand or fall together, every member being responsible for the action of any other. 235. From the above, it is crystal clear that the doctrine of collective responsibility on which Mr . Lal Narayan Sinha has so heavily leaned does not grant immunity to the State Ministers from being subjected to the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act and the plaintiff can derive no help from it. 236. If the Act is really a constitutional law as understood and explained by eminent scholars, surely the Parliament has transgressed its limits in enacting such a law. It is axiomatic that the amendment of the Constitution cannot be allowed except as provided for in Article 368. There are certain exceptions to it. Examples of exceptions are very few. Numerous such examples given by Wanchoo, J., as he then was, in Golak Nath case'1 , at page 827, if we may say so with great respect, are not quite accurate. The powers given to a particular Legislature under any of the entries in the respective lists of the Seventh Schedule or by any particular article of the Constitution are of the same kind and quality; as for example, when Articles 10, 59(3) and 65(3) speak about a law to be made by the Parliament then it is not conferring a power in the Parliament to amend the Constitution. The power is an ordinary legislative one. But there are a few articles in the catalogue given by Wanchoo, J., which empower the Parliament, in substance and in effect, to amend a particular provision of the Constitution by an ordinary legislative procedure and that necessitated an express provision to say that no such law as aforesaid shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of Article 368 vide, for example, Articles 4(2) and 169(3).

T23 clause (1) of Article 4 and clauses (1) and (2) of Article 169 will be tanta- mount to an amendment of the Constitution, by a legal fiction clauses (2) and (3) of the said articles respectively· provide that such law shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution and the procedure prescribed by Article 368 will not be necessary •o be followed. 237. A quotation from Hood Phillips' Constitutional Law· was given to us by Mr. Sinha to say : The constitutional law of a State is the law relating to the Constitu- tion of that State. (page l) The Constitution of a State is the system of laws, customs and convention which define the composition and powers of organs of the State and regulate the relations of the various State organs to one another and to the private citizen. (page 4) It is not necessary to multiply the quotations. In no sense the impugned law is a constitutional law. 238. Mr. Sinha also contended that an ordinary law cannot go against the basic scheme or the fundamental backbone of the Centre-State relation- ship as enshrined in the Constitution. He put his argument in this respect in a very ingenious way becauae he felt difficulty in placing it in a direct manner by saying that an ordinary law cannot violate the basic structure of the Constitution. In the case of Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain'\" such an argument was expresr.edly rejected by this Court .. We may rest content by referring to a passage from the judgment of our learned brother Chandrachud, J., at pages 669-670 (SCC pp. 261-262, para 691) which runs thus : The constitutional amendments may, on the ratio of the Fundamental Righls case, be tested on the anvil of basic structure. But apart from the principle that a case is only an authority for what it decides, it does not logically follow from the majority judgment in the Fundamental Rights case that ordinary legislation must also answer the same test as a constitutional amendment. Ordinary laws have to answer two tests for their validity : (I) The law must be within the legislative competence of the Legislature as defined and specified in Chapter I, Part XI of the Constitution and (2) it must not offend against the provisions of Articles 13( l) and (2) of the Constitution. 'Basic structure', by the majority judgment, is not a part of the fundamental rights nor indeed a provision of the Constitution. The theory of basic structure is woven out of the conspectw of the Constitution and the amending power is subjected to it becau:i.e it is a constituent power. 'The power to amend the fundamental instrument cannot carry with it the power to destroy its essential features'-this, in brief, is the arch of the theory of basic structure. It is wholly out of place in matters relating to the validity of ordinary laws made under the Constitution. 239. The doctrine of \"implied prohibition\", 1elied upon by Mr. Sinha, has repeatedly been rejected by the Courts in England~ Australia and by this Court. There is a veritable roll-call of such cases.

Outrim (supra). Reference may also be made to The State of Victoria v. The Commonwealth of Australia78 • These and many earlier cases of this Court were all considered and tl\\e doctrine of \"implied prohibition\" was definitely rejected by overwhelming majority in the case of His Holin,ss Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru v. State of Kerala77 , popularly known as Fundamental Rights case. We may just refer to the observations of Palekar, J ., at page 608 (SCC p. 707), Dwivedi, J., at page 916 (SCC p. 942) and Chandrachud,J., at page 977 (SCC p. 988) .. To the same effect is the view expressed by Ray, J., as he then was, Khanna, J., and others. The power granted to the Central Legislature under Entry 45 of the Concurrent List is clear and explicit for passing a law of inquiry in regard to any of the matters in List 11. That being so, the power cannot be curtailed on the doctrine of \"implied prohibition\". As a matter of fact one had to search in vain the basis for even applying this doctrine in this case. 240. Wynes in his book Legislative, Executive and Judicial Powers in Australia, Fourth Edition, has said at pages 12 and 13: The only way in which the Court could determine whether the prescribed limits of legislative power had been exceeded or not was \"by looking to the terms of the instrument by which, affirmatively, the legislative powers were created, and by which negatively, they are restricted\" * * * * * * The affects of Engineers' case upon Commonwealth-State relations are considered in Chapter IX. What is important for present purposes are the principles of interpretation there laid down and acted upon ever since. The rejection of the doctrines of mutual non-interference and State reserved powers has had a profound effect upon the Consti- tution inevitably leading to what Professor Sawer has described as an \"expansive\" interpretation of federal powers. For it followed from the principle that Dominion and Colonial Legislative powers are plenary (a principle from which the High Court has never deviated) and an interpretation of specific grants of power read in their entirety without regard to a reservation of all non-specified powers, that the enumerated powers of the Commonwealth were to be read in their full sense subject only to the prohibitions expressly or by implication set upon them in the Constitution itself. And the express provision for supremacy of Commonwealth over State laws -in the event of conflict completed the process; as Dixon, C.J. remarked in 1947, the Commonwealth is bound to be in the better position, because it is a Government of enumerated powers. 241. q'here is, in our opinion, no justification for reading down the provisions of the Act, viz. Sections 2 and 3, nor are the said provisions constitutionally invalid on any account. 242.

It was a faint, weak and hesitant argument to escape the Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Centre. The grounds of mala fides, somewhat vaguely and faintly alleged in the plaint, could not be, and were not, pressed at the time of the hearing of the suit. What was, however, argued for our consideration was that the two inquiries-one set up by the State earlier and the other appointed by the Gentre later-are almost one and the same; they .cannot be allowed to go side by side. However the fact that the Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Centre is for the purpose of making an inquiry into the definite matter of public importance within the meaning of Section 3( l) of the Act could not be and was not disputed. The only point debated was whether another Commissiol'I. appointed by the Central Government to inquire into the same matter for which a Commission had already been set up the: State Government is violative of proviso (b) to Section 3( l). But there is no substanc;:e in this argument. Firstly, the notification of the State Government has not in terms appointed any Commission for inquiry into the matters of alleged corruption, nepotism, favouritism, and maladminis- tration of the Chief Minister or any other Minister of the Government of Karnataka. The items specified in clawes (1) to (XXXII) are said to be \"irregularities committed or excess payments made in certain matters relating to contracts, grant of land, allotment of sites, purchase of furniture, disposal of food-grains etc.\". In none of those clauses it is mentioned as to who is said to be responsible for the alleged irregularities or maladministration. There is no reference to any alleged misconduct, corruption or maladminis- tration of the Chief Minister or of any other Minister. The last clause (XXXIII) is very vaguely and conveniently worded. It says: Who are the persons responsible for the lapses, if any, regarding the aforesaid and to what extent? The terms of reference in the notification issued by the Centre is to inquire into the specific matters enumerated in Annexure I, none of which is covered by the notification of the State Government, as fnr example, item 1 of Annexure I reads thus : Whether the Chief Minister practised favouritism and nepotism by appointing his own brother, Shri D. Kemparaj Urs, as a Director of the Karnataka State Film Industries Development Corporation in place of Shri R. J. Rebello, Chief Secretary to the Government, in 1974, and later as Director-in-Charge with the powers to exercise all the powers of the Managing Director. In regard to the specific matters in Annexure II there may be found some common matters which are the subject-matter of inquiry by the State Government but then, as we have already stated, in regard to the matters in Annexure II the notification in clear terms excludes any matter covered by the notification of the Government of Karnataka dated May 18, 1977. The Grover Commission, therefore, would be competent to exclude such matters from the purview of its inquiry. KAILASAM, J.

No. 365(E) dated May 23, 1977. 244. The facts of the case brjefly are: The Union Home Minister addres- sed a communication dated April 26, 1977 to the Chief Mini$ter of the State of Karnataka enclosing a copy of a memorandum of allegations purporting to be submitted by certain members of the opposition party in the Karnataka State Legislature seeking his comments thereon. The Chief Minister of the State of Karnataka replied to the Union Home Minister on May 13, 1977 answering the various allegations and charges. The Chief Minister of Karnataka also questioned the powers of the Central Government to ask for the comments of the State Government. On May 18, 1977 the State Government by a notification appointed a Commission of Inquiry ':lnder Section 3( 1) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 to inquire into various allegations and irregularities specified in the notification. The Chief Minister also addressed a letter on May 18, 1977 to the Union Home Minister informing him on the appointment of the Commission. On May 23, 1977 by a notification the t)nion of India appointed another Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of inquiring into charges of corruption, favouritism and misuse of governmental power against the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State of Karnataka. 245. In this suit the action of the Union Government in constituting a Commission of Inquiry under Section 3(1) is challenged as illegal, ultra vires and unconstitutional. The contention of the State Government is that the Central Government has no jurisdiction or authority to constitute the Com- mission of Inquiry in the exercise of its powers under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. The plaintiff contended thauhe impugned notification is destructive of the federal structure of the Constitution and scheme of distri- bution of powers, that the Constitution does not confer any supervisory or disciplinary control by the Union executive over the State Government or its Ministers and that the Constitution does not vest the Central Government with any general supervisory or inquisitorial power over the functioning of the State Governments within the respective fields. As the matter in dispute affects the legal right of the State it was submitted that a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution is maintainable in the Supreme Court. 246.

The inquiry against the Chief Miniater and the other Ministers ia against individuals and not against the State of Karnataka. There being no dispute between the Government of India and the State, a preliminary objection was taken that the suit was not- maintainable under Article 131 of the Constitution. The various pleas put forward by the plaintiff were denied and it was submitted that the impugned notification was well within the powers of the Central Government and that there had been no infringement or interference with the State's executive functions. 247. On the pleadings the following issues were framed : (1) (2) (3) Is the suit maintainable? Is the impugned notification ultra vires the pawers of the Central Government under Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act? If Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act authorises the Central Government to issue the impugned notification, is the section itself unconstitutional? 248. The main question involved in the suit is one of Centre-State relationship and whether the impugned notification is wit~ the powers of the Central Government under Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act. Though certain allegations are made in the plaint that the impugned order was mala fide it was not pressed during arguments. So also the power of the State Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry is not challenged. It is therefore not necessary to go into the reasons which induced the State Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry. Before dealing with the various contentions of the Counsel on behalf of the State and the Central Government it is necessary to set out the background and the relevant provisions of the Constitution dealing with the Centre-State Relationship and the scope of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. 249. The British Crown assumed sovereignty over India from East India Company in 1858 and the British Parliament enacted the first statute for the governance of India Act, 1858 (21 & 22 Viet., 106). The Act provided absolute imperial control without any popular participation in the administration of the country. The powers of the Crown were exercised by the Secretary of State for India assisted by a Council of Members. Subsequently the Indian Councils Act, 1861, 1892 and 1909 were passed. Later on the Government of India Acts 1912 and 1915 were passed by the British Parliament. 250. The Government of India Act, 1919, was the first step taken by the British Government for increasing the association of Indians in every branch of administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to progressive realisation of responsible Government in British India. The Government of India Act, 1919 introduced for the first time dyarchy in the provinces. The central 1ubjects were exclusively kept under the control of the Central Government. The provincial subjects were divided into 'transferred' and 'reserved' subjects. Transferred subjects were administered by the Governor with the aid of Ministers while reserved subjects were administered by the Governor and his Executive Council without any responsibility to the Legislature. By Devolution Rules made under the Government of India Act, 1919 a separation of the subjects of administration into Central and Provincial was made.

Under the Act of 1919 the provinces were delegates of the Centre and the Central Legislature retained the power to legislate for the whole of India relating to any subject. The passing of the Government of India Act, 1935 introduced. for the first time a change in the form of the Government i.e. the Government which was unitary under the Government of India Act, 1919 gave way to a federation with the provinces and the Indian State as the units. Under the unitary system the provinces were under the administrative as well as the legislative control of the Central Government. The Governor-General in Council was the keystone of the whole constitutional edifice and the British Parliament discharged its responsibility through the Secretary of State ,and the Governor-General in Council. 251. The intention of the Government of India Act, 1935 was to unite the provinces and the Indian States into a federation under the Crown. The unitary State was to be broken into a number of autonomous provinces deriving their authority directly from the Crown instead of from the Central Government and then building them up into a federal structure in which both the federal and provincial Governments would get powers directly from the Crown. The basis of the change is the resumption into the hands of the Crown all rights, authority and jurisdiction in or over the territories of the British India and redistribution of the powers between the Central Govern- ment and the provinces. Though the federal structure contemplated under the Government of India Act, 1935 did not come into existence as the Indian States refused to join the federation, so far as the provinces were concerned it took effect. The Government of India Act, 1935 divided legislative powers between the central and the provincial Legislatures and within its defined sphere, the provinces were no longer delegates of the Central Government but were autonomous units of administration. The Government of India assumed the role of the federal Government. With regard to provincial Governments the executive authority of the provinces was exercised by the Governor on behalf of the Crown and not as a subordinate of. the Governor-General, with the advice of Ministers responsible to the Legislature. In the Centre the executive authority was vested with the Governor-General and with regard to reseTved subjects, defence, external affairs, etc. the Governor-General was to act in his discretion, with the help of counsellors appointed by him without being responsible to the Legislature. Governor- General was to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers who were responsible to the Legislature with regard to subjects other than reserved subjects. The Governor-General was to act under the control and directions of the Secretary of State regarding his special responsibilities. The Govern- ment of India Act, 1935 distributed the powers between the federal Legislature and the provincial Governments by having (i) Federal List over which the Federal Legislature had exclusive pQ..wers of legislation ; (ii) A Provincial List over which the Provincial Legislature had exclusive jurisdic- tion; and (iii) A Concurrent List over which both the Federal and Provincial Legislatures had competence. The federal law prevail~d over a provincial law if there was any repugnancy and the residuary power of legislation under the 1935 Act vested with the Governor-General. Under the scheme, the legislative powers of both the central and provincial Legislatures were subject to various limitations and either of them was not a sovereign Legislature. Another feature of the 1935 Act was that the Federal Court was set up mainly for determining the disputes between the units and the federation.

The Indian Independence Act, 1947 was passed as an interim measure before the coming into force of the Con'stitution. The object of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 as amended by Adaptation Orders was to make provisions for an interim Constitution until the Constituent Assembly could draw up a future Constitution. Indian Independence Act, 1947 altered the constit~tional position by declaring that with effect from August 15, 194 7 the suzerainty of the British Crown over the Indian States would lapse and from that date United Kingdom would cease to have any responsibility in respect of the Government of the territories included in British India. The Central Legislature of India ceased to exist from August 14, 1947. The Constituent Assembly came into existence for framing of the Constitution and also functioned as the Central Legislature of the Dominion. The new Constitution adopted the bulk of the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935. The provisions relating to distribution of powers between the units and the, Centre were adopted and in fact extended. The Constitution-makers gave up the unitary bias and adopted detailed provisions regarding the distribution of powers and functions between the Union and the States in all aspects of their administrative and other activities. Inter-State relations, co-ordination and adjudication of disputes amongst the States were also provided for. 253. The Indian Constitution cannot be described as a federal Consti- tution as the Indian Federation is not a result of an agreement by various States and the territorial integrity of the States is not guaranteed as the territories of the States can be changed or a State completely abolished under Article 4 of the Constitution. But it has to be borne in mind that after the lapse of paramountcy of the British Crown, the Indian States acceded to the Dominion of India were brought within the Union envisaged by the Consti- tution. The Indian States which acceded to the Dominion were brought under the federal system on the same footing as other Units of the Federation, namely the Provinces. The position of the States in the Constitution is in several respects subordinate to the Central Government in that the formation of the federadon was not as a result of any treaty between the States and the federation, and that the State may be reformed or altogether eliminated under Article 4 of the Constitution. Though the Constitution divides executive power between the Union and the States, the States are bound to execute certain directions of the Union. The executive power regarding the laws made by the Union in the Concurrent subjects will be exercised by the States unless the Parliament directs otherwise and as regards the Union subjects the Union may delegate its executive functions to a State either by legislation by Parlia1nent or by consent of the State Govern~ent. It is a duty of the State to execute the Union law and the executive power of the State must be exercised in such manner as not to interfere with the executive power of the Union and the State shall be under the direction of the Union regarding the Union laws. The failure of the State to carry out the directions of the Union would empower the Union to supersede the State Government by assuming to itself the powers of the State Government. These features make the Constitution strictly not a federal Constitution. It has been variously called as quasi-federal or federal in structure or federal system with a strong central bias. But whether the Constitution is recognised as federal or not the position of the States is distinctly recognised. Under Article l of the Constitution of India, India shall be a Union of States.

Historically aa the Princely Indian States joined the Union and for other reasons the State aa an entity was recognised. The Constitution is the source of power for the Union as well aa the States. While under the Government of India Act, 1935 the source of power for the Federal and the Provincial Government was the Crown, under the Consti- tution of India, the source of power for the States as well aa the Union is the Constitution. In its own field i.e. as regards the power conferred on the State, it is supreme so also the Central Government. But in determining what are the powers of the Union and the State one baa to look into the Conatitution and nowhere else. The States are not the delegates of the Central Government and the Central Government cannot exercise any power over the State which is not provided for in the Constitution. 25-t. Part V of the Constitution deals with the Union. Chapter I deala with the Executive, Chapter II with Parliament, Chapter III with Legislative Powers of the President, Chapter IV with the Union Judiciary and Chapter V with the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India. Part VI of the Consti-. tution deala with the States. Chapter I is General, Chapter II deals with the Executive, Chapter III with the State Legislature, Chapter IV with Legislative Power of the Governor, Chapter V with the High Courts in the States and Chapter VI with Subordinate Courts. Part XI deals with the Relations between the Union and the States. Chapter I of Part XI deals with Legislative Relations and distribution of Legislative Powers while Chapter II deals with Administrative Relations between the Union and the States. A few of the articles in these chapters will be ref erred to in detail later. But it is sufficient at this stage to note that while Part Vis assigned to the Union executive and Part VI to the States, Part XI deals with the Relations between the Union and the States. The distribution of powers between the Union and the States can be discerned from the various provisions of the Constitution. A machinery is also provided for, for settling their disputes in the Constitution. In the distribution of powers it is clear there is strong tilt in favour of the Union. According to the Constitution, the Union can assume powers of the State Government by taking over the State Administration under certain contingencies provided for in the, Consti- tution. But the Union Government cannot claim any power which is not vested in it under the provisions of the Constitution. There is no overriding power with the Union Government. It cannot deal with the State Govern- ment as its delegate, for the source of power for the Union as well as the State, is the Constitution and the Union Government cannot claim any powers over the State which are not found in the Constitution. 255. The nature of our Constitution has been discU1sed by the Supreme Court in a few decisions which may be referred to at this stage. In Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. v.

The learned Judge further observed: \"In evolving an integrated policy on this subject our Constitution-makers seem to have kept in mind three main considerations which may be broadly stated thus: first, in the larger interests of India there must be free flow of trade, commerce and intercourse, both inter-State and intra-State; second, the regional interests must not be ignored altogether ; and third, there must be a power of intervention by the Union in any case of crisis to deal with particular problems that may arise in any part of India\". The learned Judge con- cluded : \"Therefore, in interpreting the relevant articles in Part XIII we must have regard to the general scheme of the Constitution of India with special reference to Part III (Fundamental Rights), Part XII· (Finance, Property etc. containing Articles 276 and 286) and their inter-relation to Part XIII in the context of a federal or quasi-federal Constitution in which the States have certain powers including the power to raise revenues for their purposes by taxation\". The decision is clear authority for the pro- position that the essential structure of Indian Government is of federal or quasi-federal character, the units having also certain powers as the Union itself. 256. On this aspect the learned Solicitor-General very strongly relied on certain passages in State of West Bengal v. Union of lndia8°, in the majority judgment delivered by Sinha, C. J. Referring to Article 4 of the Constitution which empowers the Parliament by legislation to alter the territory of the State or abolish it altogether Sinha, C. J. observed : \"When the Parliament is invested with authority lo alter the boundaries of any State and to diminish its areas so as to even destroy a State with aJl its power and authority, it would be difficult to hold that the Parliament which is competent to destroy a State is, on account of some assumption as to absolute sovereignty of the State, incompetent effectively to acquire by legislation designed for that purpose the property owned by the State for governmental purposes' '. The learned Chief Justice further observed that \"Even if the Constitution were held to be a federal one and the States regarded qua the Union as sovereign the power of the Union to legislate in respect of the property situate in the State would remain unrestricted\". The Court was considering an Act passed by the Parliament, the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Develop- ment) Act, 1957, enabling the Union of India to acquire certain coal bearing areas in the State of West Bengal. The State filed a suit contending that the Act did not apply to lands vested in or owned by the State and that if it applied to such lands the Act was beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament. The decision as far as it holds that even if the Constitution were held to be a federal Constitution and the States regarded qua the Union as sovereign, the power of the Union to legislate in respect of the property would remain unrestricted, may be right as falling within the power of the Parliament under Entry 42, List III and Entries 52 and 54 of List I. · But with vet y great respect the observation that ''the Constitution of India is not truly federal in character .... that only those powers which .are con- cerned with the regulation of local problems are vested in the States\" is 80.

TM Sttm of Assam (supra) and Thi Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Lid. v. TM Stau of Rajasthan (supra) which is a decision of a Bench of Seven Judges of this Court. The observation of the Court that from the powen conferred on the Parliament under Article 4 it cannot be held that it is incompetent for the Parliament to acquire by legislation the property owned by the States on the theory of the absolute sovereignty of the States, cannot be understood as having laid down that the States have no sovereignty even in theit own sphere or that Parliament has any overriding or supervening powen. The observation of Subba Rao, J. as he then was in the dissenting j\\Jdgment that the Indian Constitution accepts the federal concept and distributes the sovereign powers between the co-ordinate constitutional entities, namely, the Union and the States and that this concept implies that one cannot encroach upon the governmental functions or instrumentalities of the other, unless the Constitution expressly provides for such interference, is in accordance with the accepted view of this Court. It is unfortunate that the Parlier decisions of this Court in Atial>ari Tea Co. Lid. v. TM Stale of Assam (supra) and Thi Aulomoliile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v. TM Stau of Rajaslhan. (supra) were not brought to the notice of the Court. In Special Iufwmee 1 of J!J64&1, dealing with the Centre-State relationship this Court observed: · Our Legislatures have undoubtedly plenary powers, but these powers are controlled by the basic concepts of the written Constitution itself and can be exercised within the legislative fields allotted to their jurisdiction by the three Lists under the Seventh Schedule ; but beyond the Lists, the Legislatures cannot travel. They can no doubt exercise their plenary legislative authority and discharge their legislative func- tions by virtue of the powers conferred on them by the relevant provisions of the Constitution ; but the basis of the power is the Constitu- tion itself. Besides, the legislative supremacy of our Legislatures including the Parliament is normally controlled by the provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution. If the Legislatures step beyond the legislative fields assigned to them, or acting within their respective fields, they trespass on the fundamental rights of the citizens in a manner not justified by the relevant articles dealing with the said fundamental rights, their legislative actions are liable to be struck down by Courts in India. Therefore, it is necessary to remember that though our Legislatures have plenary powers, they function within the limits prescribed by the material and relevant provisions of the Constitution. It was further observed : In a democratic country governed by a written Constitution, it is the Constitution which is supreme and sovereign. It is no doubt true that the . Constitution itself can be amended by the Parliament, but that is possible because Article 368 af the Constitution itself makes a provision in that behalf and the amendments of the Constitution can be validly made only by following the procedure prescribed by the said article. That shows that even when the Parliament purports to amend the Constitution, it has to comply with the relevant mandate of the Constittr- tion itself. 257.

Our Constitu- tion accepted a federal scheme though limited in extent having regard to the regional interests, resources, language and other diversities existing in the vast subcontinent. These facts have been taken into account by the Consti- tution m~kers and a limited federalism w~ made a part of the Constitution by Article I itself providing that India shall be a Union of States. Effect is given to this intention by separation of the Lists and by providing legislative and executive power to the Union and the States in separate chapters of the Constitution. This principle has been accepted by the Supreme Court in the decisions in Ati_abari Tea Co. Ltd. v. The State of Assam and The Automobile Transport ( Rajasthan) Ltd. v. The State of Rajasthan cited earlier. The observations made in the West Bengal cases (supra) which have been referred to already are not in conformity with the otherwise consistent view of the Supreme Court that the Constitution is supreme and that the Union as well as the States will have to trace their powers from the provisions of the Constitution and that the Union is not supreme and the States are not acting as delegates of the Union. 258. It may be useful to refer to the views expressed by the Supreme Court in the KesavJnanda81 and Election case.1~3 on this subject. The question that arose in those cases was how far the Constitution could be amended. In Kesavananda case, the majority was of the view that the . basic structure of the Constitution cannot be amended. The Election case proceeded on the basis of Kesavananda's case that the basic structure could not be amended . The learned Counsel for the plaintiff Mr. Lal Narain Sinha made it very clear that he is not inviting the Court to find any undefined basic structure but is confining his arguments to point out that the federal structure in the limited sense is an integral part of the Constitution and that the Union Government is not supreme and it has no power apart from what is found in the Constitution. In Kesavananda case it was held by the majority that Article 368 does not enable the Parliament to alter the basic structure or the framework of the Constitution. Chief Justice Sikri in discussing as to what is the basic structure of the Constitution held that it consisted of ( 1) Supre- macy of the Constitution, (2) Republican and democratic form of Govern- ment, (3) Secular character of the Constitution, (4) Separation of powers between legislatures, executive and judiciary, and (5) Federal character of the Constitution, For the purposes of the present discussion it is unnecessary to go into the question as to whether the federal structure as found in the Constitution could be amended or not as it is sufficient to note that it is recognised that the States do constitute an integral part of the Constitution having their legislative and executive powers and that these powers cannot be interfered with by the Union Government unless in accordance with the provision, of the Constitution. 259. Before dealing with the position of the States in the Constitution it has to be borne in mind that in the distribution of powers between the Union and the States there is a strong bias in favour of the Union. In the event of an emergency the federal Government can convert itself into a unitary one. The Union Government can supersede the State Government which refused to carry out its directions as are authorised under Article 365 of the Constitution.

There are provisions in the Constitution conferring wider powers on the Union in case of financial emergency. The executive authority of the Union becomes enlarged enab- ling the Union to giv~ directions to the State requiring financial discipline. The Union Parliament can assume the legislative powers over any subject included in the State List by a Resolution under Article 249 if such legisla- tion is necessary in the national interest. Whenever the State Government cannot be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution the President is empowered to take over and the Union can assume the executive and legislative powers of the State under Article 356. Though there is a division of powers between the Union and the States there is pro- vision for control by the Union Government both over the administration and legislation of the State. These are provided for under Article 201 which empowers the President to disallow any State legislation which is reserved for his consent. A duty is cast upon the States by the Constitution under Articles 256 and 257 to execute the Union laws. The executive power of every State shall be so exercised, as not to interfere with the executive power of the Union and that in th~e matters the States shall be under the directions of the Union. These powers are specifically mentioned in the Constitution and it is not disputed that the Union Government can exercise them. 260. The question that arises for consideration is whether the Union Government can order an inquiry into the governmental functions of the State which is not specifically conferred on the Union by the Constitution. The preliminary objection of the Union Government that it is not the State but only the Government of the State or the Ministers that are aggrieved will be dealt with in due course. The position of the States ia indicated in Article 1 which declares that India shall be a Union of States and the States and the territories thereof shall be as specified in the First Schedule and the territory of India shall comprise the territories of the States, the Union territories and such other territories as may be acquired. Part VI of the Constitution deals with the States. Article 154(1) vests the executive power of the State in the Governor and provides that it shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution. Article 162 provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution the executive power of the State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws. There is a proviso to Article 162 which provides that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of a State and Parliament have power to make laws, the executive power of the State :;:hall be subject to, and limited by, the executive power expressly conferred by this Constitution or by any law made by Parliament upon the Union or authorities thereof. ,Article 163 provides that there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor in the ,exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is by or under this Constitution required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion. Under Article 164 the Chief Minister shall be appointed by the Governor and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. It further provides that the Ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor and the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State. Chapter III deals with the State Legis- lature. Article 168 relates to constitution of Legislatures in the States. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

UNION OF INDIA (Kailasam, J.) 735 This chapter confers executive power of the State in the Gcvernor who shall exercise it with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head. It is also provided that the executive power of the State shall extend to matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws. So far as the executive and legislative power of the State is concerned it is absolute subject only to the other provisions of the Constitution. Part XI of the Constitution deals with relations between the Union and the States : Chapter I with legislative relations and Chapter II with administrative relations between the Union and the States. The scheme for the distribution of legislative power between the Union and the States has been taken over from the Go\\ ernment of India Act, 1935 and Articles 245 and 246 more or less reproduce Sections 99 and 100· of the 1935 Act. Article 245( I) provides \"Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India, and the Legislature of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State\". Article 246 confers on the Parliament the exclusive power to make laws with respec~ to any of the matters enumerated in List I of the Seventh Schedule. The Legislature of the State has exclusive power to make laws for the State in respect of any matters enumerated in List II i. e. State List. The Parliament and the Legislature of the State shall have power to make laws with respect to any matter enumerated in List III i. e. Concurrent List. It is important to note that the powers conferred under Articles 245 and 246 are subject to the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore the laws made by a legislature may not be valid for either lack of jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter or on the ground that they violate the provisions of the Constitution. The residuary power of legislation is conferred on the Parliament under Article 248 which provides that the Parliament has exclusive power to make any law with respect to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or in the State List. Under Article 246(1) and (2) and Article 254( I} when a State law is in conflict with a State law or repugnant to Union law which Parliament is competent to enact the Union law shall prevail and the State law shall be void to the extent of repugnancy. But an attempt should be rr.ade to see whether the conflict could be avoided by construction . If a reconciliation is impossible only then the federal power should prevail. Article 248( I) and Entry 97 in List I of the Seventh Schedule make it clear that the residuary power is with the Parliament and when a matter sought to be legislated is not inclu- ded in List II or List III the Parliament has power to make laws with respect to that matter or tax. But function of the Lists is not to confer powers on the Legislature. They only demarcate the legislative field. The Federal Court in The Gor,ernor-General in Council v. Tiu Releigh Investment Co.81 observed that \"the purpose of the List was not to create or confer power but only to distribute to federal and provincial Legislatures the powers which had been conferred by Sections 99 and 100 of the Act\". While approving the observations of the Federal Court in Union of India v. H. S. Dhillon86 the majority for whom Chief Justice Sikri spoke held that \"It (Article 248) is framed in the widest possible terms. On its terms the only question to be asked is: Is the matter sought to be legislated included in List II or in List III or is the tax sought to be levied mentioned in List II or in List III? No question has to be asked about List I. If the answer is in the negative, then it follows that Parliament has power to make laws with respect to that matter or tax\". But this observation does not decide the question whether the residuary legislative power of the Union includes a right to direct inquiry 84. 1944 FCR 229, 261 ss.

The Relei1h Inv.stmmt Co. the pur- pose of the Lists is not to create or confer powers and the powers conferred under Articles 245 and 246 are subject to the provisions of the Constitution. As there is no provision in the Constitution conferring on the Union the power to supervise the governmental functions of the State the reference to the Lists will not solve the problem. 261. The crux of the controversy is while the Karnataka State would contend that relation between the Union and the States is a subject-matter of the Constitution and is not a subject covered by any of three Lists, the contention on behalf of the Union Government is that the notification <;loes not contravene any of the specific provisions of the Constitution and as such the legislative competence of the Union cannot be questioned. While on behalf of the State of Karnataka it is submitted that the power to inquire into the conduct of a Minister who is responsible to the Legislature is only with the Legislature of the State, the submission on behalf of the Union is that the power of the Union is not specifically taken away by any of the provisions of the Constitution and therefore the contemplated inquiry is within the competence of the powers of the Union. According to the Solicitor, the right question to a~k is \"Does the legislation provide for some matter which runs countH to or is inconsistent with or brings about a change in the existing provisions of the Constitution in such manner that the original and the amended provisions are different and inconsistent?\" If it does so then it can be regarded as amendment howsoever it may be brought about i.e. by addition, variation or repeal. At the same time mere enactment of provisions which are not in any manner qualitatively inconsistent with the existing provisions of the Constitution but deal with certain aspects of legislative topics or a constitutional subject, does not postulate exercise of constituent power for amendment of the Constitution. In support of his contention that unless an expre~ provision of the Constitution is contrav·ened the law cannot be questioned on the ground of implied prohibition the learned Counsel relied on Webb v. Outrim88 • The question that arose· for decision by the Privy Council in that case was whether the respondent, an officer of the Australian C.ommonwealth, resident in Victoria and receiving his official salary in that State, is liable to be assessed in respect thereof for income-tax imposed by an Act of the Victoria Legislature. It was not contended before the Court that the restriction on the powers of the Victoria Constitution is enacted by any express provision of the Commonwealth Constitution Act but was argued that inasmuch as the imposition of an income-tax might interfere with the free exercise of the legislative or executive power of the Commonwealth, such interference must be impliedly forbidden by the Constitution of the Commonwealth, although no such express prohibition can be found therein. The Court held : \"The enactments to which attention has been directed do not seem to leave any 'Toom for implied prohibition\". It was further held that \"It is impossible to suppose that the question now in debate was left to be decided upon an implied prohibition when the power to enact laws upan any subject whatsoever was before the Legislature\".

Burah is that \"when a question arises whether the prescribed limits h,tve been exceeded the only way in which it can be done is by looking into the terms of the instrument by which affirmatively the legislative powers WPre creatPd and by which negatively they are restricted. If what has bPen done is legislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power, and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that pown is limited, it is not for any Court of Justice to inquire furth<'1, or to enlarge constructively those conditions and restrictions\". In 1912 AC 571 it was held that \"if the text is explicit the text is C\"nclusive, alike in what it directs and what it forbids. When the text is ambiguous, as, for example, when the words establishing two mutually exclusiv<' jurisdictions are wide enough to bring a particular power within either, recourse must be had to the context and scheme of the Act\". The decision of the Australian High Court in The Amalgamated Society of Engineers v. The Ailelaide Steamship Company Ltd. 89 , in which it was held that the doctrine of implied prohibition against the exercise of power once ascertained in accordance with ordinary rules of construction was rejected by the Privy Council in Webb v. Outrim (supra). 262. The dPcision in The State of Victoria v. The Commonwealth of Australia90 wa::. reft>rred to but as that decision reiterates the principles laid down in R. v. Burah (supra) it is not necessary to refer to it. The principle laid down is that if what has been dont- is legislation within the general words which giv<' the power and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited, then it is not for the Court of Justice to inquire hut it cannot be understood as meaning that the word 'express' does Not exclude what is necessarily implied. In Liyanage v. R. 91 the Privy Council while interpreting the Constitution of Ceylon held that the Constitution dill not expressly vest the judicial power exclusivdy in the judiciary but, that fact was not decisive as the scheme of the Constitution particularly the provisions relating to the judiciary viewed in the light of thC' fact that the judicial power had always been vested in Courts, held that thP judkial powPr vest(•d Pxdusively in the judiciary. To the same effect is the dPcision of this ( :ourt in The State of West Bengal v. Nripendra Nath Bagchi9?.. The question that arose in that case was whether the inquiry ordered by the Government and conducted by an Executive Officer of the Government against a District .rnd Sessions Judge contravened the provisions of Article 235 of the Constitution which vests in the High Court the control over the District Court and the Courts subordinate thereto. The Court construed the word 'control' usPd in Article 235 as including disciplinary control or jurisdiction over Di~trict Judges. Relying on the history which lay behind the enactment of th<'se articles the Court came to the conclusion that 'control' was vested in the High Court to effectuate a purpose, namely, the securing of the ind<'pendence of the subordinate Judiciary and unless it included discipli- nary control as well, the very object would be frustrated. It also took into account the fact that the word 'control' is accompanied by the word 'vest' which is a strong word which showed that the High Court is made the sole custodian of the control over thP judiciary. The Court observed: \"This aid to construction (the history which lies behind the enactment) is admis- sible because to find out the meaning of a law, recourse may legitimately be had to the prior state of the law, the Pvil sought to be removed and the 89. 28 CLR 12q 92.

Taking into account the history and the scheme of the Constitution, the safeguards in the Constitution regarding the States have necessal\"ily to be implied; though it is conceded on behalf of the State of Karnataka that no particular provision of the Constitution has been expressly modified, amended or altered. 263. The extent of the executive power of the Union is found in Article 73 and that of _the State is given in Article 162. In Part XI, Chapter II, which deals with the administrative relations between the Union and the States Articles 256 and 257 list the obligations of the States and the Union and control of the Union over the States in certain cases. Article 256 provides that the executive power of every State shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that State, and the executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for that purpose. Under this article it is obligatory on every State to so exercise its executive power as to ensure the compliance with the laws made by the Parliament and the executive power of the Union shall extend to giving such instructions to the State as are necessary for that purpose. Article 257(1) provides that the executive power of every State shall be so exercised as not to impede or prejudice the exercise of the execu- tive power of the Union, and the executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for that purpose. Sub-article (2) extends the power of the Union to giving directions as to the construction and maintenance of means of communication declared in the direction to be of national or military importance, sub-article (3) extends the power of the Union to the giving of directions to a State as to the measures to be taken for the protec- tion of the railways within the State. By Forty-second Amendment to the Constitution Article 257A was introduced by which Government of India is empowered to deploy any armed force of the Union or any other force subject to the control of the Union for dealing with any grave situation of law and order in any State. Sub-article (2) of Article 257A provides that any armed force or other force or any contingent or unit thereof deployed under clause (1) in any State shall act in accordance with such directions as the Government of India may issue and shall not, save otherwise provided in such directions, be subject to the superintendence or control of the State Government or any officer or authority subordinate to the State Government. No reliance was placed by the Government of India on any of its inherent or overriding powers. Except in cases referred to in Articles 256 and 257 and 257 A, the Constitution does not provide for the Union Government to give any directions to the State Government. Though under Article 355 it shall be the duty of the Union to protect every State against external aggression and internal disturbance, it was thought a constitutional amendment was necessary to enable the Government of India to deploy armed forces to deal with grave situation of law and order.

State of Punjab98, Wanchoo, J. has stated \"The Constitution is the fundamental l.aw and no law passed under mere legislative power conferred by the Constitution can affect any change in the Constitution unless there is an express power to that effect given in the Constitution itself. But subject to such ~xpress power given by the Constitution itself, the fundamental law, namely the Constitufion, cannot be changed by a law passed under the legislative provisions contained in the Constitution as all legislative Acts passed under the power conferred by the Constitution must t:onform to the Constitution. There are a number of articles in the Constitution which expressly provide for amendment by law, as for example 3, 4, 10, 59(3), 65(3), 73(2), 97, 98(3), 106, 120(2), 135, 137, 142(1), 146(2), 148(3), 149, 169, 171(2), 186, 187(3), 189(3), 194(3), 195, 210(2), 221(2), 225, 229(2), 239(1), 241(3), 283(1) and (2), 285(2), 287, 300(1), 313, 345, 373, Schedule V, Clause 7 and Schedule VI, Clause 21\". Article 2 enables the Parliament by law to admit into the Union, or establish, new States on such terms and conditions ·as it thinks fit and Article 3 enables the Parliament by law to form new States and alteration of the areas or boundaries of any State and the names of the existing States. Article 4 provides that laws made under Articles 2 and 3 shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the First Schedule and the Fourth Schedule as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of the law and may also contain such supplimental, incidental and consequential provisions as Parliament may deem necessary. Sub-article (2) of Article 4 provides that no such law as aforesaid shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Consti- tution for the purposes of Article 368. So also Article 169( I) enables the Parliament by law to provide for the abolition of the Legislative Council of a State and sub-article (3) provides that no such law as aforesaid shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of Article 368. Similar provisions are found in Schedule V, Clause 7 and Schedule VI, Clause 21 where the law made by Parliament · is deemed not to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of Article 368. So far as the other articles mentioned above are concerned the articles themselves enable the Parliament to make law for the purposes mentioned in the various articles. Regarding the articles in which no power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws, Parliament cannot add to the Constitution by ordinary law-making process. 265. The Union Government relied on Entry 94 in List I and Entry 45 in List III in the Seventh Schedule as empowering it to enact the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, and to issue the impugned notification. Entry 94 in List I runs as follows : 94. Inquiries, surveys and statistics for the purpose of any of the matters in this List. Entry 45 in List III, Concurrent List, is as follows: 45. Inquiries and statistics for the purposes of any of the matters specified in List II or List III. As Entry 94 in List I is confined to matters in List I the learned Solicitor rightly did not rely on that entry but relied mainly on Entry 45 in List III. Entry 45 enables the Union to make laws for inquiries for the purpose of any of the matters specified in Lists II & III i. e. State List and the Conct)rrent List. The question that arises is whether the word 'inquiries' 93.

The golden rule of interpretation is that the words should be read in their ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning and in construing words in a Constitution conferring legislative power the most liberal construction should be put upon the words so that they may have effect in their v.idest amplitude. But this rule is subject to certain exceptions. If it is found necessary to prevent conflict between two exclusive jurisdic,ions a restricted meaning may be given to the words. The Federal Court in Re tlu Central Provimes and Berar Sales of Motor Spirit and Lubricants Taxation Act, 1938 (Central Provinces and Berar Act XIV of 1938) (A Special Referenc• under Section 213 of tlu Government of India Act, 1935) 94 in construing the expressions \"duties of excise\" in Entry 45 of List I in the Seventh Schedule and \"taxes on sale of goods\" in Entry 48 of List II i. e. the State List, held that the conflict could be resolved by giving the expression \"duties of excise\" a restricted meaning, namely that the duty of excise is a tax on manufacture or production of goods. Thus it is permissible to give a restricted meaning in construing the language of conflicting provisions. In The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd. 95 , it was held that though in construing a legislative entry widest construction must be put on the words used, as the expression \"sale of goods\" was a term of well-recognised legal import in the general law relating to the sale of goods and in the legislative practice relating to that topic, it must be interpreted in Entry 48, List II, Schedule 7 of the Act as having the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act. The rule that in construing the words in a Constitution most liberal construction should be put upon the words is not a universal rule as is seen from the judgment of Lord Blackburn in River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson96 where Lord Blackburn expressed his view that in interpreting the words, the object is to ascertain the intention expressed by the words used and that the object of interpretation of documents and statutes is to ascertain ''the intention of them that made it\". Lord Coke in Heydon' s case97 applied the principle which was laid down by Lord Blackburn. In R. M. D. Chamarbaugwalla v. The Union of lndia96 , Venkatarama Ayyar, J. cited with approval the rule in Heydon's case and added that the principles laid down are well-settled and have been applied in Bengal lmmuniv, Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar99 , and observed that the legislative history of the impugned law showed that prize competitions involving skill had presented no problems to the Legislatures, and that having regard to that history, and also the language used in the Act, the definition must, by construction, be limited to prize competitions of a gambling nature. Thus there i<i ample authority for the proposition that in interpretation of statutes the main object is to ascertain the \"intention of them that made it\". 266. It is therefore necessary to discern the intention of the Parliament in enacting the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. The inquiry under Entry 45 is for the purpose of any of the matters specified in List II or List III. It is seen that inquiry into the misconduct in exercising govern- mental functions by the Chief Minister of a State cannot be discerned from any of the entries in List II or List III. Entry 45 is in the Concurrent Lis! and if a law could be enacted by the Parliament empowering the Union Government to conduct an inquiry into the misuse of the governmental 94. 1939 FCR 18 95. 1959 SCR 379: AIR 1958 SC 560: (1958) 9 STC 353 96.

Obviously the powers conferred under Entry 45 cannot be construed in such manner, for it could never have been intended. Otherwise the result will not be conducive to the harmonious functioning of the Union and the States. This circumstance is a strong indication that in Entry 45 in List III 'inquiries' should not be given a wide meaning as conferring on the Union and the State Governments powers to enact a provision to embark on an enquiry as to the misuse of the governmental powers by the other. 267. The provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, Act 60 of 1952 will now be examined. The preamble of Act, is as follows : An Act to provide for appointment of Commissions of Inquiry and for ves.ting such Commissions with certain powers. Section 2 defines the \"appropriate Government\" as meaning the Central Government in relation to a Commission appointed by it to make an inquiry into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List I or List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the State Government, in relation to a Commission appointed by it to make an inquiry into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. Section 3(1) provides for the appointment of Commission. It runs as follows : 3. ( 1) The appropriate Government may, if it is of opinion that it is necessary so to do, and shall, if a resolution in this behalf is passed by the House of the People or, as the case may be, the Legislative Assembly of the State, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance and performing such functions and within such time as may be specified in the notification, and the Commission so appointed shall make the inquiry and perform the functions accordingly: The proviso to Section 3( 1) bars the State Government except with the approval of the Central Government to appoint another Commission to inquire into the same matter when a Commission appointed by the Central Government is functioning and bars the Central Government from appoint- ing a Commission from inquiring into the same matter so long as the Commission appointed by the State Government is functioning unless the scope of the inquiry is extended to two or more States. Under Section 3( 1) the appropriate Government may appoint a Commission but shall appoint one if a- resolution is passed by the House of the People or, the Legislative Assembly of the State as the case may be. The purpose of the Commission is to make an inquiry into any \"definite matter of public importance''. 268. The Parlia~ent under the Act has delegated its legislative func- tions to the appropriate Government and has conferred the discretion to appoint a Commission if it is in its opinion necessary to do so and makes it obligatory on the Government to appoint a Commission if there is a resolu- tion by the Legislature concerned. The purpose of appointment of the Commission is for making an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance. There is no mention or guidance as to the person against whom an inquiry is to be conducted.

Such a construction would not reflect, the intention of the Parliament. Before dealing fully with the scope of the powers of the appropriate Government as a delegate and the construction that has to be put on the scope of appointment of a Commission of Inquiry under this section, it is necessary to notice other relevant provisions of the Act. Sub-section (4) of Section 3 requires the appropriate Government to lay before the House of the People or the House of Legislative Assembly of the State, the report of the Commission on the inquiry made by the Commission together with a memorandum of the action taken thereon, within a period of six months of the submission of the report by the Commission to the appropriate Government. Sub-section (4) therefore contemplates some action to be taken by the appropriate Government. Section 4 deals with the powers of a Commission. It shall have the powers of a Civil Court while trying the suit under the Code of Civil Procedure, !908, in respect of matters mentioned in the section. Section 5 enables the Commission to require any person to furnish informa- tion on the subject-matter of the inquiry and any person so required shall be deemed to be legally bound to furnish such information within the meaning of Sections 176 and 177 of the Indian Penal Code. The Commission may also cause search and seizure of books of account and documents or take extracts or copies there from so far as they are applicable. The Commission is deemed to be a Civil Court for certain purposes mentioned in sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 5. Section 5A empowers the Commission to utilize the services in the case of a Commission appointed by the Central Gevern- ment, of any officer or investigation agency of the Central Government or any State Government with the concurrence of the Central ( }overrwient or the State Government, as the case may be ; or in the case of a Commission appointed by the State Government, of any officer or investigation agency of the State Government -or Central Government with the concurrence of the State Government or the Central Government, as the case may be. The Commission may summon and enforce the attendance of any person and examine him, require the discovery and production .of any document, and requisition any public record or copy thereof from any office. Section 8B provides that if at any stage of inquiry the Commission considers it necessary to inquire into the conduct of any person and is of opinion that his reputation is likely to be prejudicially affected by the inquiry the Commission shall give to that person a reasonable opportunity of being heard and Section 80 confers a right of cross-examination and representation by the legal practitioner to persons referred to in Section 8B of the Act. 269. Reading the Act as a whole the Commission. is given wide powers of inquiry compelling the attendance of witnesses and persons who are likely to be prejudicially affected giving them a right of cross-examination. When a report is submitted by the Commission Section 3(4) contemplates action to be taken by the appropriate Government. 270.

UNION OP INDIA (Kaifasam, J.) 743 inquiry into the governmental action of the State or the Union, as the case may be, it would not be conducive to the smooth running of the Constitution. Under Section 3 the Parliament has conferred the power on the appropriate Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to inquire into any definite matter of public importance. On behalf of the Union it was sub- mitted that the words \"definite matter of public importance\" would embrace the inquiry into the misuse of the governmental functions of the State and in support of this contention several decisions were cited. 271. In M. V. Rajwadd v. Dr. S. M. Hassanl'» the question arose as to whether a Commission appointed under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, has the status of a Court. The High Court at Nagpur held that the Act does not confer on it the status of a Court. The facts of the case are that the Government of Madhya Pradesh appointed a Commission of Inquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, with Hon'ble ShriJustice B. K. Chaudhuri as the sole member. The Commission was asked to inquire and report whether (i) the firing was justified; (ii) excessive force was used; and (iii) after the firing adequate action was taken to maintain peace and order, to prevent recrudescence of trouble and to give adequate medical and other aid to the injured. Dealing with the nature of the inquiry the Court held that the Commission in question was obviously appointed by the State Government for the information of its own mind, in order that it should not act, in exercise of its executive power, otherwise than in accordance with the dictates of justice and equity, in ordering a departmental inquiry against its officers. It was therefore a fact-finding body meant only to instruct the mind of the Govern- ment without producing any document of a judicial nature. So far as the scope of the inquiry in the case was concerned it falls strictly within Section 3 as the inquiry related to a definite matter of public importance and not an inquiry into the misuse of governmental functions of a Chief Minister or a State Minister. On the facts of the case it was appropriate that the Court found that it was merely a fact-finding body meant to instruct the mind of the Government. In Brajnandan Sinha v. Jyoti Narain101 the Supreme Court considered the question whether the Commission appointed under the Public Servants {Inquiries) Act, 1850, is not a Court with the meaning of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952. The Court approved the view taken by the Nagpur High Court that the Commission was only a fact-finding Commission meant only to instruct the mind of the Government and found that a Commission under the Public Servants {Inquiries) Act, 1850,, is not a Court. In Shri Ram Krishna D-almia v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar1\" the Central Government appointed a Commission of Inquiry to inquire into and report in respect of certain companies mentioned in the schedule attached to the notification and in respect of the nature and ex.tent of the control and interest which certain persons named in the notification exercised over these companies. The validity of the Commissions of Inquiry Act was questioned. The Supreme Court held that the Act was valid and intra vires and the notification was also valid excepting the words \"as and by way of securing redress or punishment\" in Clause JO thereof which went beyond the scope of the Act.

The Court further observed that the discretion given to the Government to set up a Commission of Inquiry is guided by the policy laid down in the Act and the executive action is to be taken only when there exists a definite matter of public importance into which an inquiry is necessary. The facts of the case are that the Central Government appointed a Commission of Inquiry under Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, to inquire and report in respect of the administration of the affairs of companies specified in the schedule and other matters mentioned in Clauses (2) to (11) of the Order. The inquiry under Clause (3) is regarding the nature and extent of the control, direct and indirect, exercised over such companies and firms or any of them by Shri R. K. Dalmia and three others, their relatives, employees and persons connected with them. Under Clause (10) the inquiry was against any irregularities, frauds or breaches of trust etc. and required the Commission to recommend the action which in the opinion of the Commission should be taken as and by way of securing redress and arrangement or to act as a preventive in future cases. This Court held that the Commission in the case was merely to investigate and record its findings and recommendations without having any power to enforce them. It was further h~ld that a portion of last part of Clause ( l 0) which called upon the Commission of Inquiry to make recommendations about the action to be taken as and by way of securing redress or punishment cannot be said to be at all necessary or ancillary to the purpose of the Commission. The Court held that the words \"as and by way of securing redress or punishment\" clearly go outside the scope of the Act, and such a provision was not covered by the two legislative entries in the Constitution and should therefore be deleted. Considering the scope of Section 3 it observed that the \"answer is furnished by the statute itself for section indi- cates that the appropriate Government can appoint a Commission of Inquiry only for the purpose of an inquiry into any definite matter of public importance and to no other matter\" . In other words, the subject-matter of inquiry can only be of a ''definite matter of public importance\". Rebutting the contention on behalf of the appellant that the delegation of the authority to the appropriate Government is unguided and uncontrolled, the Court observed that ''the executive action of setting up a Commission of Inquiry must conform to the condition of the section, that is to say, that there must exist a definite matter of public importance into which an inquiry is, in the opinion of the appropriate Government, necessary or is required by a resolu- tion in that behalf passed by the House of the People or the Legislative Assem- bly of the State\". The Court proceeded to observe that if the Parliament had declared with sufficient clarity the policy and laid down the principles for the guidance of the exercise of the powers conferred on the appropriate Govern- ment it cannot be said that an arbitrary and uncontrolled power had been delegated to thf' appropriate Government. On the facts of the case before the Court the conclusion was reached that the power was exercised within the policy laid down by the Parliament and the guidance afforded by the preamble and Section 3 of the Act. The decision ,was not dealing with a case in which the inquiry is ordered into the misuse of governmental functions of the Chief Minister of a State exercising the executive functions of the State. The Court also rejected the plea on behalf of the appellant that the act and conduct of individual persons can never be regarded as definite matter of public importance, observing that the act and conduct of individuals may assume such dangerous proportions as may well affect the public well-being and thus become a definite matter of public importance.

Sec- tion 8B which was introduced by an amendment by Act 79 of 1971 provides that if at any stage of the inquiry the Commission considers it necessary to inquire into the conduct of any person or is of opinion that the reputation of any person is likely to be prejudicially affected by the inquiry, the Commis- sion shall give to that person a reasonable opportunity of being heard in the inquiry and to produce evidence in his defence. The amendment would indicate the procedure to be adopted if in the course of the inquiry it becomes necessary to inquire into the conduct of any person. This would suggest that principally the inquiry is as regards a matter of definite public importance. It may be that in some cases the conduct of individuals may become a definite matter of public importance as laid down in R. K. Dalmia's case. But the decision does not conclude the point that has arisen in this case, namely whether the definite matter of public importance should be construed as to include the right to inquire into the abuse of governmental functions by a State Government when no such intention could have been in -the minds of the Parliament. 272. In Stale of Jammu and'Kashmir v. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad 108 , the State Government of J ammu and Kashmir issued a notification under Sec- tion 3 of the Jammu and Kashmir Commission of Inquiry Act, 1962, setting up a Commission to inquire into the wealth acquired by the first respondent and certain specified members of his family during his period of office. It may be noted ·that the Commission of Inquiry was set up by the State Government after Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad resigned and ceased to be the Chief Minister of the State. 273. Two of the three Judges of the High Court took the view that the matter referred to was not of public importance because on the date of the notification Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad did not hold any office in the Government and that there was no evidence of public agitation in respect of the conduct complained of and that showed that they were not matters of public importance. The Supreme Court rejected the view taken by the High Court observing: \"It is difficult to imagine how a Commission can be set up by a Council of Ministers to inquire into the acts of its head, the Prime Minister, while he is in office. It certainly would be a most unusual thing to happen. If the rest of the Council of Ministers resolves to have any inquiry, the Prime Minister can be expected to ask for their resignation. In any case, he would himself go out. If he takes the first course, then no Commission would be set up for the Ministers wanting the inquiry would have gone. If he went out himself, then the Commission would be set up to inquire into the acts of a person who was no longer in office and for that reason, if the learned Judges of the High Court were right, into matters which were not of public mportance. The result would be that the acts of a Prime Minister could never be inquired into under the Act. We find it extremely difficult to accept that view\". The decision of the Court is that the inquiry into the past acts which have affected the public well-being would be matters of public importance and it was irrelevant whether the person who committed those acts is still in power to be able to repeat them. The pronouncement is an authority for the proposition that inquiry into the acts of a person who had ceased to be a Chief Minister may continue to be a matter of public importance. 274:.

This Court rejected the contention that the inquiry against a person is out- side the scope of Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act. It was con- tended before this Court relying on Section 10 of the Jammu and Kashmir Commission of Inquiry Act, 1962 that the inquiry directed into the conduct of .6akshi Ghulam Mohammad was outside the scope of the Act. Section 10 of the J ammu and Kashmir Act is similar to the present Sections 8B and 8C of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. The section states that if at any stage o( the inquiry the Commission considers it necessary to inquire into the conduct of any person or is of opinion that the reputation of any person is likely to be prejudicially affected by the inquiry the Commission shall give to that person a reasonable opportunity of being heard in the inquiry and to produce evidence in his defence. Basing on the wording of the section it was submitted that the inquiry is normally only into a definite matter of public importance and inquiries into the conduct of a person can arise only as in- cidental or ancillary to such an inquiry. As the section contemplates the necessity of inquiry into the conduct of a person arising at any stage of the Inquiry Commission's proceedings, it was submitted that the inquiry into the conduct of a person is only incidental. This Court rejected the contention on the ground that Section 3 which permits a Commission of Inquiry to be appointed is wide enough to cover an inquiry into the conduct of an indivi- dual and it could not be natural reading of the Act to cut down the scope of Section 3 by an implication drawn from Section 10. This observation was, as the subsequent sentence makes it dear, made in rejecting the plea that Section 10 does not apply to a person whose conduct comes up directly for inquiry before a Commission set up under Section 3. In Bakshi's case (supra) as the inquiry was ordered by the State Government into the affairs of a Chief Minister who had ceased to be in office, the Court was not called upon to consider the question whether the Union Government can appoint a Commission of Inquiry into the conduct of a Chief Minister of a State in office which implies the determination of Centre-State relationship under the Constitution. In this case the appointment was by the State Government against the erstwhile Chief Minister. Apart from this question it is seen that if Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 is construed as enabling the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry into the conduct of a State Chief Minister in office it would result in empowering the Central Government which is a delegate of the Parliament to exercise the powers which would never have been contemplated by the Parliament, for as already pointed out the result of such construction would be inviting the State Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry into the conduct of Central Ministers regarding matters in List II and List III. It is significant to note that after Bakshi's case (supra) was decided by the Supreme Court in 1966, amendments were introduced to the Commissions of Inquiry Act by Act 79 of 1971. Section 8B runs as follows: 8B. If, at any stage of the inquiry, the Commission,- (a) considers it necessary to inquire into the conduct of any person; or (b) is of opinion that the reputation of any person is likely to be pr, judicially affected by the inquiry, the Commission shall give to that person a reasonable opportunity of being heard in the inquiry and to produce evidence in his defence: Provid~d that nothing in this sPction shall apply where the credit of a witness is being impeacbPd. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

UNION OF INDIA (Kailasam, J.) 747 No do'-'bt, there was corresponding section, Section 10, of the Jammu and Kashmir Commission of Inquiry Act, 1962, which was considered in Bakshi's case (supra) by the Supreme Court, and the Court had held that Section 10 was also applicable to a case in which the conduct of a person was directly under inquiry. It observed that the scope of Section 3 cannot be cut down by an implication drawn from Section 10. The subsequent.amendment of the Act by introduction of Section 8B, which provides that if at any stage of the inquiry, the Commission considers it necessary to inquire into the conduct of any person, or is of opinion that the reputation of a person is likely to be prejudicially affected by the inquiry, would indicate that the Parliament was aware of the consequences of such wording, and intended the Act to be applicable in the main to any definite matter of public importance while an inquiry into the affairs of persons would be permissible if it arose as incidental or ancillary to such inquiry. This construction appears to be justifiable, for otherwise Section 3 would have the result of empowering the delegate i.e. the Union Government, to ord.er an inquiry into the affair of the Chief Minister of a State and inviting the same treatment from the State Government. 275. The decision in P. V.. Jagannath Rao v. State of Orissa104 also relates to the appointment by the State Government of a Commission of Inquiry into the conduct of the Chief Minister and Ministers who ceased to hold office on the date of the notification in regard to the irregularities committed during the tenure of their office and it does not relate to the Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Central Government to inquire into the abuse of governmental functions by the Chief Minister and other Ministers. 276. It will be seen on an examination of the cases cited above that in no case the Central Government had ordered an inquiry into the abuse of powers by the State Chief Minister in office. It is stated that an inquiry was ordered by the Central Government against Pratap Singh Kairon, a State Chief Minister, while in office but the validity of such an order was not questioned before a Court. The Sarkaria Commission was appointed by the Central Government to inquire into the conduct of the Chief Minister when he ceased to hold that office and the President took over the administration of the Tamil Nadu State. While in office the Chief Minister questioned the Union Government's power to appoint such a Commission. 277. The impugned notification by the Central Government was chal- lenged on the ground that it is in violation of the proviso to Section 3(1) of the Commissions of Inquiry Act. Under the proviso when a State Govern- ment has appointed a Commission of Inquiry, the Central Government shall not appoint another Commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the Commission appointed by the State Government is functioning, unless the Central Government is of opinion that the scope of the inquiry should be extended to two or more States. In this case it is common ground that the State Government had appointed a Commission of Inquiry earlier. The scope of the inquiry ordered by the Central Government does not extend to two or more States. In the circumstances the notification is sought to be supported by the Centr-al Government on the p!Pa that the inquiry does not relate to the \"same matter\" and therefore the validity of the notification cannot be challenged . Reading Section 3(1) along with the proviso, it is apparent that the intention of the Act is to enable the appropriate Govern- ments i. e. the Central or the State Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an inqui-y into any definite matter of 104. 0968) 3 SCR 789: AIR 1969 SC 215 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The Central Government can appoint a Commission to make an inqui,;y into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List I, List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution while the State Government can appoint a Commission to inquire into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List II and List III of the Constitution . As both the Central Government and the State Govern- ment have power to appoint a Commission of Inquiry relating to entries in List II and List III there might arise occaaiom when their may be over- lapping: In order to avoid such a contingency provisos (a) and (b) to Section 3( 1) enact that when the Central Government has appointed a Com- mission of Inquiry the State Government shall not appoint another Com- mission to inquire into the same matter without the approval of the Central Government as long as ~he Commission appointed by the Central Govern- ment is functioning and the Central Government shall not appoint another Commission to inquire into the same matter as long as the Commission appointed by the State Government is functioning. These provisions are for the purpose of avoiding any conflict by the two Governments appointing two st>parate Commissions to inquire into the same matter. In a speech made by the Minister for Law Shri C. C. Biswas while introducing the Bill on August 6, 1952 in the Rajya Sabha, he explained the provisions of Section 3 and its underlying purposes as follows: Then there is also the question whether and how far there may be overlapping inquiries by the Centre appointing a Commission on its own and a State also a Commission of its own to deal with the same matter. That is dealt with here in the proviso. The danger of overlapping is avoided by providing that if there is a Commission appointed by the Central Government already functioning then it will not be open to a State Government, except with the approval of the Centre, to appoint another Commission to inquire into the same matter. Similarly, if there is already a Commission appointed by a State Government func- tioning with respect to a matter which is within the jurisdiction of the State it will not be open to the Central Government to override the State Commission except in certain circumstances which are indicated, that is, unless the Central Government is of the opinion that the scope of inquiry should be extended to two or more States. Then of course this will be done, obviously not without reference to the State. So, as you will see, Sir, provision is made in this clause for avoiding conflict between the Centre and the State. It will be seen that the provisos were enacted for the purpose of avoiding conflict between the Union and the State. The very object of the proviso to Section 3 is defeated by the construction sought to be put upon by the Union Government. The objection to the appointment of a Commission by the Union Gover11,ment when there is already a Commission appointed by the State functioning is sought to be got over by the Union on the plea that by the impugned notification the inquiry is not directed against the same matters for which the State has appointed a Commission of Inquiry. In the written statement filed on behalf of the Union of India, it is contended that the matters referred to the Grover Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Union Government are those which are not covered by the terms of reference of the Hussain Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Government of Karnataka and that Annexure I to the notification dated May 23, 1977 lists such allegations. contained in the Memorandum dated April 11, 1977 as are not at all included in the terms of reference of the Hussain Commission of Inquiry and that relating to allegations contained in Annaure II the said ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

UNION OP INDIA (Kaifasam, J.) 149 allegations stipulated that the Grover Commission of Inquiry will inquire into the said allegations excluding any matter covered by the notification of the Government of Karnataka dated May 18, 1977. It was submitted that while the matter referred to by the State Government is regarding various irregularities, the inquiry directed by the Central Government is for making an inquiry on charges of corruption, nepotism, favouritism or misuse of governmental power against the Chief Minister and certt1in other Ministers of the State of Karnataka. The notification of the Karnataka State Govern- ment appointing a Commission of Inquiry runs as follows: Whereas ~egations have been made on the floor of the Houses of the State Legislature and elsewhere that irregularities have been com- mitted/excess payments made in certain matters relating to contracts, grant of land, allotment of sites, purchase of furniture, disposal of f oodgrains, etc. ; Whereas the State Government is of the opinion that it is necessary to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to inquire into the said allegations; Now therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section ( 1) of Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 (Central Act 60 of 1952) the GoVt>rnment of Karnataka hereby appoint Justice Shri Mir Iqbal Hussain, Retired Judge of the Karnataka High Court to be the Commission of Inquiry .... The plea on behalf of the State is that the inquiry is directed against all the allegations that have been made on the floor of the Houses of the State Legislature and elsewhere and the charges therefore comprehend all the matters that are found in the impugned notification. Further it was sub- mitted that as the Commission is to go into and determine as to who are the persons responsible for the lapses the inquiry would include charges against the Chief Minister also. As the purpose of the two provisos to Section 3(1) is to avoid conflict, the words \"the same matter\" in the provisos should be given a wide interpretation and only matters that are not referable to the subject-matter of the inquiry by the Commission appointed by the State can be taken over by the Centre. We were not called upon to go into the two notifications and determine which item in the notification of the Central Government is not covered by the State Government notification. In giving a wider meiining to the words 'the same matter' with a view to avoid con- flict, the contention of the Central Government that the inquiry into the conduct of the Chief Minister about the same incident will make it a different matter cannot be accepted. 278. The contention as to the maintainability of the suit under Article 131 of the Constitution may now be considered. Article 131 is as follows: Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Supreme Court shall, to the exclusion of any other Court, have original jurisdiction in any dispute- (a) between the Government of India and one or more States; or (b) • • • • • (c) between two or more States, if and in so far as the dispute involves any question {whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends : The point is whether the dispute involves any question whether of law or fact on which the existence or extent of a legal right ot the State depends. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The submission on behalf of the Union Government is that what is affected is not the legal right of the State but if at all that of the State Government or the Ministers concerned. Ministers may have a cause of action in which case the remedy will be by way of a petition under Article 226. If the State Government feels aggrieved they can also take action under Article 226, but unless the legal right of the State is affected recourse to Article 131 cannot be had. Relying on the General Clauses Act and the distinction that is maintained in the Constitution between the State and the State Government it was submitted that the State itself is an ideal person intangible, invisible, and immutable, and the Government is its agent. In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties it is necessary to refer to the relevant articles of the Cohstitution to determine the question as to whether any of the legal rights of the State is affected. Part VI of the Constitution relates to the States and Article 154 provides that the executive power of the State shall be vested in the Governor and shall be exercised by him either directly or through the officers subordinate to him in accordanct> with the Constitution. Article 162 provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution the executive power of the State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws. In other words the executive power of the State is co-extensive with the legislative power of the State. The executive power of the State will be exercised by the Governor with the aid and advice of the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State. Accord- ing to the impugned notification Commission of Inquiry is appointed for the purpose of making an inquiry into a definite matter of public importance, namely charges of corruption, nepotism, favouritism or misuse of govern- mental power against the Chief Minister and certain other Ministers of the State of Karnataka. The inquiry therefore is amongst other things regarding the misuse of the governmental power against the Chief Minister and other 1\\1inisters of the State. The executive function of the State which is vested in the Governor is exercised by him with the aid and advice of the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers. The power is also exercised by the Governor either directly or indirectly through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution. The governmental functions of the State are performed by the Governor as required by the Constitution with the aid and advice of the Ministers. The scope of the enquiry would inevitably invJlve the functioning of the executive of the State. The plea of the State Government is that its powers are derived from the Constitution and its existence and its exercise of powers as executive of the State is guarantl\"ed by the Constitution, and the Centre cannot interfere with such exercise of t-xecutive functions. The question in.volves the extent of the executive power of the State and any interference with that power by the Central Government would affect the legal z·ight of the State. The plea on behalf of the Union Government is that Article 154 contemplates the exercise by the Governor of his executive power through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution. The sub(Jlission is that when the powers are exercised through Ministers who, according to the learned Counsel for the respondent, are officers the rights of auch Ministers or officers are only interfered with and not the' legal rights of the State. Further it was submitted that State is different from the Government of a State and if any action of the State or the Ministers of the State is questioned the State as such cannot have any grievance. When the exercise of the executive functions of the State through its officers is interfered with by the Central Government it cannot be said that the legal right of the State is not affected. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

UNION OP INDIA (.Kai/asam, J.) 751 279 Strong reliance was placed by the Union Government on a ·recent decision of the Supreme Court in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India 105• The States of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Orissa filed suits under Article 131 of the Constitution against the Union of India challenging a directive contained in a letter dated April 18, 1977 issued by the Union Home Minister to the Chief Ministers of the States as unconstitutional, illegal, and ultra vires of the Constitution and for a declaration that the plaintiffs States are not constitutionally or legally obliged to comply with or give effect to the directive contained in the said letter. The power of the Central Government to dissolve the State Assemblies was questioned. A preliminary objection was raised to the maintainability of the suit on the ground that no legal rights of the State were infringed and that the State is different from the State Government and if at all any one was aggrieved it was the State Government and not the State. Chief Justice Beg observed that even if there be some grounds for making a distinction between a State's interests and rights and those of its Government or its members, the Court need hot take a too restrictive or a hypej:'•technical view of the State's rights to sue for any rights, actual or fancied, which the State Government chooses to take up on behalf of the State concerned in a suit under Arti'tle 131. Mr. Justice Chandrachud was of the view that when the States question the constitutional right of the Union Government to dissolve the State Assemblies on the grounds mentioned in the Home Minister's letter to the Chief Ministers a legal, not a political, issue arising out of the existence and extent of a legal right squarely arises and the suits cannot be thrown out as falling outside the purview of Article l 31. The learned Judge proceeded to express his view as follows: The legal right of the States consists in their immunity, in the sense of freedom from the power of the Union Government. They are entitled, under Article 13 l, to assert that right either by contending in the absolute that the Centre has no power to dissolve the Legislative Assemblies or with the qualification that such a power cannot be exercised on the ground stated. Bhagwati and Gupta, JJ. were of the view that the exercise of the power in the case would affect the constitutional right of the State to insist that the federal basis of the political structure set up by the Constitution shall not be violated by an unconstitutional assault under Article 356( l). As the suit sought to enforce a legal right of the State arising under the Constitution the suit could not be thrown out in limine as being outside the scope and ambit of Article 131. Goswami and Untwalia, JJ. were of the view that the legal right must be that of the State. When the Home Minister asks the Chief Ministers of the Government of the States to ad\\•ise the Governors to dissolve the Legislativt> Assemblies and the Chief Ministers decline to accept the advice it is not a dispute between the State on the one hand and the Government of India on the other. It is a real dispute between the Government of the State and the Government of India. It is no doubt a question of life and death for the State Government but not so for the State as a legal entity, as even after the dissolution of the Assembly the State will continue to have a Government for the time being as provided for in the Constitution. Fazal Ali, J. was of the view that the mere fact that letters were St>nt to the State Government containing gratuitous advice would not create any dispute if one did not exist before nor would such a 10:i. t\\977) 3 sec 592 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The State Government who have raised dispute are not covered by the word 'State' appearin\"g in Article 131 and therefore the suits were not maintaiIJ.able on that ground also. It will be seen that four of the seven Judges were of the view that the suits are maintainable though Bhagwati ~nd Gupta, JJ. were of the view that there is a difference between the State and the State Government. Whatever the question that might have risen regarding the dissolution of the Assemblies, in the present case the dispute relates to the functioning of the State in exercise of the powers conferred under the Constitution and the State's legal rights are affected. The preliminary objection therefore fails. 280. To sum up taking into account the history of the development of the Indian Constitution and its scheme the impugned notification impinges on the right of the State to function in its limited sphere. Further, the impugned notification is beyond the powers conferred on the Union Govern- ment under Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952. In this view the question whether Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 is ultra vires the power of Parliament or not does not arise. 281. It is necessary that Commission of Inquiry should be appointed in order to maintain and safeguard the purity of the Union and the State administration. But such Commission of Inquiry should be strictly in accordance with the Constitution and should not affect the Centre-State relationship. The proposal now pending before Parliament for appointment of a Lok Pal to conduct such inquiries is a move in the right direction, if sufficient constitutional safeguards are provided for the institution of Lok Pal. 282 . In view of the Judgment the first issue whether the suit is maintainable is answered in the affirmative. Under Issue 2 the impugned notification is ultra vires the powers of the Central Government conferred on it by Section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act. In this view Issue 3 does not arise for consideration. The suit has to be decreed as prayed for. ORDER 283. In accordance with the view of the majority, the suit is dismissed with costs.
