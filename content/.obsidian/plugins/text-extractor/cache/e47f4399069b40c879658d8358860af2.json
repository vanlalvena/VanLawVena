PRELUDE ததயயனனறற சடறடபணற உளறளனறமற ஆறனதத நனவயனனறற சடறடவட Said the Tamil Poet­Philosopher Tiruvalluvar of the Tamil Sangam age   (31,   BCE)   in   his   classic   “Tirukkural”.   Emphasizing   the importance of sweet speech, he said that the scar left behind by a burn injury may heal, but not the one left behind by an offensive 1 speech. The translation of this verse by G.U. Pope in English reads thus: “In flesh by fire inflamed, nature may thoroughly heal the sore;  In soul by tongue inflamed, the ulcer healeth never more.” A Sanskrit Text contains a piece of advice on what to speak and how to speak. सतयय बबरययतब पपबपयय बबरययनन बबरययतब सतयमपपबपयमब । पपबपयय च नयननतय बबरययददष धमरर सनयतनर ॥ satyam brūyāt priya brūyān na brūyāt satyam apriyamṃ | priya ca nān ta brūyād e a dharma sanātanaṃ ṛ ṃ ṣ ḥ ḥ || The meaning of this verse is: “Speak what is true; speak what is pleasing; Do not speak what is unpleasant, even if it is true; And   do   not   say   what   is   pleasing,   but   untrue;   this   is   the eternal law.” The “Book of Proverbs” (16:24) says: “Pleasant   words   are   a   honeycomb,   sweet   to   the   soul   and healing to the bones” Though   religious   texts   of   all   faiths   and   ancient   literature   of   all languages   and   geographical   locations   are   full   of   such   moral injunctions emphasising the importance of sweet speech (more than 2 free speech), history shows that humanity has consistently defied those diktats. The present reference to the Constitution Bench is the   outcome   of   such   behaviour   by   two   honourable   men,   who occupied the position of Ministers in two different States. I.   Questions formulated for consideration 1. By an order dated 05.10.2017, a Three Member Bench of this Court directed Writ Petition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016 to be placed before   the   Constitution   Bench,   after   two   learned   senior   counsel, appointed as amicus curiae, submitted that the questions arising for consideration in the writ petition were of great importance. Though the Bench recorded, in its order dated 05.10.2017, the questions that   were   submitted   by   the   learned  amicus   curiae,   the   Three Member Bench did not frame any particular question, but directed the matter to be placed before the Constitution Bench. 2. At this juncture, a Special Leave Petition (Diary) No.34629 of 2017   arising   out   a   judgment   of   the   Kerala   High   Court   came   up before the same Three Member Bench. Finding that the questions raised in the said SLP were also similar, this Court passed an order 3 on 10.11.2017, directing the said SLP also to be tagged with Writ Petition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016. 3. Thereafter,   the   Constitution   Bench,   by   an   order   dated 24.10.2019, formulated the following five questions to be decided by this Court:­ “…1)   Are   the   grounds   specified   in   Article   19(2)   in relation to which reasonable restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed by law, exhaustive, or can restrictions on the right to free speech be imposed on grounds not found in Article 19(2) by invoking other fundamental rights?  2) Can a fundamental right under Article 19 or 21 of the Constitution of India be claimed other than against the ‘State’ or its instrumentalities?  3) Whether the State is under a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution   of   India   even   against   a   threat   to   the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another citizen or private agency?  4) Can a statement made by a Minister, traceable to any affairs of State or for protecting the Government, be   attributed   vicariously   to   the   Government   itself, especially   in   view   of   the   principle   of   Collective Responsibility?  5)   Whether   a   statement   by   a   Minister,   inconsistent with   the   rights   of   a   citizen   under   Part   Three   of   the Constitution,   constitutes   a   violation   of   such constitutional   rights   and   is   actionable   as ‘Constitutional Tort”? …” 4 II. A brief backdrop 4. Without a brief reference to the factual matrix, the questions to be answered by us may look abstract. Therefore, we shall now refer to the background facts in both these cases.    5. Writ Petition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016 was filed under Article 32   of   the   Constitution   praying   for   several   reliefs   including monitoring   the   investigation   of   a   criminal   complaint   in   FIR No.0838/2016   under   Section   154   Cr.P.C.,   for   the   offences   under Sections 395, 397 and 376­D read with the relevant provisions of the   Protection   of   Children   from   Sexual   Offences   Act,   2012   (for short, ‘POCSO Act’) and for the trial of the case outside the State and also for registering a complaint against the then Minister for Urban   Development   of   the   Government   of   U.P.   for   making statements outrageous to the modesty of the victims. The case of the petitioner in Writ Petition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016 in brief was that   on   29.7.2016   when   he   and   the   members   of   his   family   were travelling from Noida to Shahjahanpur on National Highway 91 to attend   the   death   ceremony   of   a   relative,   they   were   waylaid   by   a 5 gang. According to the writ petitioner, the gang snatched away cash and   jewelry   in   the   possession   of   the   petitioner   and   his   family members and they also gang raped the wife and minor daughter of the   petitioner.   Though   an   FIR   was   registered   on   30.7.2016   for various   offences   and   newspapers   and   the   television   channels reported   this   ghastly   incident,   the   then   Minister   for   Urban Development   of   the   Government   of   U.P.   called   for   a   press conference   and   termed   the   incident   as   a   political   conspiracy. Therefore, the petitioner apprehended that there may not be a fair investigation. The petitioner claims that he was also offended by the irresponsible   statement   made   by   the   Minister   and   hence   he   was compelled to file the said writ petition for the reliefs stated supra. 6. Insofar  as Special Leave Petition (Diary) No.34629 of 2017 is concerned, the same arose out of a judgment of the Division Bench of   the   Kerala   High   Court   dismissing   two   writ   petitions.   The   writ petitions were filed in public interest on the ground that the then Minister   for   Electricity   in   the   State   of   Kerala   issued   certain statements   in   February   2016,   7.4.2017   and   22.4.2017.   These statements were highly derogatory of women. Though according to 6 the petitioners in the public interest litigation, the political party to which   the   Minister   belonged,   issued   a   public   censure,   no   action was taken officially against the Minister. Therefore, the petitioner in one writ petition prayed among other things for a direction to the Chief Minister to frame a Code of Conduct for the Ministers who have   subscribed   to   the   oath   of   office   as   prescribed   by   the Constitution with a further direction to the Chief Minister to take suitable action if any of the Ministers failed to live upto the oath. The  prayer   in   the   second   writ  petition   was  for   a   direction   to   the concerned   Authorities   to   take   action   against   the   Minister   for   his utterances. 7. Both the writ petitions were dismissed by a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court, on the ground that the prayer of the public interest writ petitioners were in the realm of moral values and that the   question   whether   the   Chief   Minister   should   frame   a   code   of conduct for the Ministers of his cabinet or not, is not within the domain   of   the   Court   to   decide.   Therefore,   challenging   the   said common order, the petitioner  in  one of those  public interest writ petitions has come up with Special Leave Petition (Diary) No.34629 7 of 2017.  Since the questions raised by the petitioner in the Special Leave   Petition   overlapped   with   the   questions   raised   in   the   Writ Petition, they have been tagged together.  III. Contentions 8. We   have   heard   Shri   R.   Venkataramani,   learned   Attorney General for India, Ms. Aparajita Singh, learned senior counsel who assisted   us   as  amicus   curiae,  Shri   Kaleeswaram   Raj,   learned counsel   for   the   petitioner   in   the   special   leave   petition   and   Shri Ranjith   B.   Marar,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   person   who sought to intervene/implead. III.A. Preliminary note submitted by learned Attorney General for India 9. The   learned   Attorney   General   for   India   submitted   a preliminary note containing his submissions question­wise, which can be summed up as follows:­ Question No.1 (i) On   question   No.1   it   is   his   submission   that   as   a   matter   of constitutional principle, any addition, alteration or change in the   norms   or   criteria   for   imposition   of   restrictions   on   any fundamental   right   has   to   come   up   through   a   legislative 8 process.   The   restrictions   already   enumerated   in   clauses   (2) and   (6)   of   Article   19   have   to   be   taken   to   be   exhaustive. Therefore, the Court cannot, under the guise of invoking any other fundamental right such as the one in Article 21, impose restrictions   not   found   in   Article   19(2).   Under   the Constitutional scheme, there can be no conflict between two different fundamental rights or freedoms. Question No. 2 (ii) The   Constitution   itself   sets   out   the   scheme   of   claims   of fundamental rights against the State or its instrumentalities and it has also enacted in respect of breaches or violations of fundamental   rights   by   persons   other   than   State   or   its instrumentalities. Any proposition, to add or insert subjects or matters   in   respect   of   which   claims   can   be   made   against persons other than the State, would amount to Constitutional change. The concept of State action propounded and applied in US Constitutional Law and the enactment of 42 US Code § 1983 have to be seen in the context of peculiar state of affairs dealing with governmental and official immunities from legal proceedings. In view of specific provisions in Articles 15(2), 17, 23 and 24 of the Indian Constitution, there may not be a strict need to take recourse to the law obtaining in the USA. Claims against persons other than the State, either through enacted law or otherwise must be confined to constitutionally enacted subjects or matters.  9 Question No. 3 (iii) There are sufficient Constitutional and legal remedies available for a citizen whose liberty is threatened by any person. Beyond the Constitutional and legal remedy and protection available, there   may   not   be   any   other   additional   duty   to   affirmatively protect   the   right   of   a   citizen   under   Article   21.   Cases   of infringement   of   fundamental   rights   are   taken   care   of   under Articles 32 and 226.  Question No. 4 (iv) Conduct of public servants like a Minister, if it is traceable to the   discharge   of   public   duty   or   the   duties   of   the   office,   is subject to scrutiny of the law. Sanction for prosecution can be granted   if   misconduct   is   committed   under   colour   of   office. Such misconduct including statements that may be made by a Minister   cannot   be   linked   to   the   principles   of   collective responsibility. The concept of vicarious liability is incapable of being   applied   to   situations   and   no   government   can   ever   be vicariously   liable   for   malfeasance   or   misconduct   of   Minister not traceable to statutory duty or statutory violations for the purpose   of   legal   remedies.   Ministerial   misdemeanors,   which have nothing to do with the discharge of public duty and not traceable to the affairs of the State, will have to be treated as acts of individual violation and individual wrong. To extend in the   abstract,   the   liability   of   the   State   to   such   situations   or instances   without   necessary   limitations   can   be   problematic. 10 Post  M/s.  Kasturi   Lal   Ralia   Ram   Jain  vs.  The   State   of Uttar Pradesh1 and following Rudul Sah vs. State of Bihar2, this   Court   has   treated   misconduct   of   public   servants   or officers and consequent infringement of Constitutional rights as ground for grant of compensation. However, there is need for   clarity   and   certainty   as   far   as   the   conceptual   basis   is concerned. This may be better resorted through enacted law. Question No. 5 (v) While the principle of Constitutional tort has been conceived in Nilabati Behera (Smt.) alias Lalita Behera (Through the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee) vs. State of Orissa3, and   subsequently   applied   to   provide   in   regard   to   the constitutional remedies, the matter pre­eminently deserves a proper   legal   framework   in   order   that   the   principles   and procedures are coherently set out without leaving the matter open­ended or vague. III.B. Notes of submissions by Amicus 10. Ms. Aparajita Singh, learned senior counsel and amicus curiae submitted a written note question­wise, which can be summed up as follows:­ Question No. 1 1 AIR 1965 SC 1039 2 (1983) 4 SCC 141 3 (1993) 2 SCC 746 11 (i) The   right   to   free   speech   under   Article   19(1)(a)   is   subject   to clearly defined restrictions under Article 19(2). Therefore, any law   seeking   to   limit   the   right   under   Article   19(1)(a)   has   to necessarily   fall   within   the   limitations   provided   under   Article 19(2).  Whenever   two   fundamental   rights   compete,   the  Court will balance the two to allow the meaningful exercise of both. This conundrum is not new, as the rights under Article 21 and under Article 19(1)(a) have been interpreted and balanced on numerous   occasions.   Take   for   instance   the   Right   to Information Act, 2005. The Act balances the citizen’s right to know under Article 19(1)(a) with the right to fair investigation and right to privacy under Article 21. This careful balancing was   explained   by   this   Court   in  Thalappalam   Service Cooperative Bank Ltd. vs. State of Kerala4.  The decision of this   Court   in  R.   Rajagopal   alias   R.R.   Gopal  vs.  State   of T.N.5  is another example of reading down the restrictions (in the   form   of   defamation)   on   the   right   to   free   speech   under Article  19(2), in   its application  to   public  officials  and  public figures in larger public interest. Again, in People’s Union for Civil   Liberties   (PUCL)  vs.  Union   of   India6,   the   right   to privacy of the spouse of the candidate contesting the election was   declared   as   subordinate   to   the   citizens’   right   to   know under   Article   19(1)(a).   In  Jumuna   Prasad   Mukhariya  vs. 4 (2013) 16 SCC 82 5 (1994) 6 SCC 632 6 (2003) 4 SCC 399 12 Lachhi Ram7, a challenge to Sections 123(5) and 124(5) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (as they prevailed at that   time)   was   rejected,   on   the   ground   that   false   personal attacks against the contesting candidate was not violative of the right to free speech. But when it comes to private citizens who are not public functionaries, the right to privacy under Article 21 was held to trump the right to know under Article 19(1)(a). This was in the case of  Ram Jethmalani  vs.  Union of   India8,  which   concerned   the   right   to   privacy   of   account holders. In Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited vs.  Securities   and   Exchange   Board   of   India9,  this   Court struck a balance between the right of the media under Article 19(1)(a)   with   the   right   to   fair   trial   under   Article   21.   The argument that free speech under Article 19(1)(a) was a higher right than the right to reputation under Article 21 was rejected by this Court in  Subramanian Swamy  vs.  Union of India, Ministry   of   Law10in   which   Section   499   IPC   was   under challenge. The right to free speech was balanced with the right to pollution free life in  Noise Pollution (V.), in Re11  and the right to fair trial of the accused was balanced with the right to fair trial of the victim in Asha Ranjan vs. State of Bihar 12.  7(1955) 1 SCR 608 8(2011) 8 SCC 1 9(2012) 10 SCC 603 10(2016) 7 SCC 221 11(2005) 5 SCC 733 12(2017) 4 SCC 397 13 Question No. 2 (ii) There   are   some   fundamental   rights   which   are   specifically granted against non­State actors. Article 15(2)(a) – access to shops,   public   restaurants,   hotels   and   places   of   public entertainment, Article 17 – untouchability, Article 23 – forced labour and Article 24­ prohibition of employment of children in factories, mines etc., are rights which are enforceable against private citizens also. Some aspects of Article 21 such as the right to clean environment have been enforced against private parties as well. The State is also under a Constitutional duty to ensure that the rights of its citizens are not violated even by non­State actors and ensure an environment where each right can   be   exercised   without   fear   of   undue   encroachment.   In People’s Union for Democratic Rights vs. Union of India13, while   rejecting   the   contention   of   the   State   that   it   was   the obligation of the private party i.e., the contractor to follow the mandate   of   Article   24   of   the   Constitution   and   the   relevant laws,   it   was   clarified   that   the   primary   obligation   to   protect fundamental rights was that of the State even in the absence of   an   effective   legislation.   In  Bodhisattwa   Gautam  vs. Subhra   Chakraborty   (Ms.)14,  interim   compensation   was awarded holding that fundamental rights under Article 21 can be enforced even against private bodies and individuals. Public law remedy has been repeatedly resorted to even against non­ 13(1982) 3 SCC 235 14(1996) 1 SC 490 14 State   actors   when   their   acts   have   violated   the   fundamental rights of other citizens. Award of damages against non­State actors   for   violation   of   the   right   to   clean   environment   under Article 21 was laid down in  M.C.  Mehta  vs.  Kamal Nath 15. Similarly, the majority and concurring opinion in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy  vs.  Union  of India16,  while elaborating on the duty of the State and non­State actors to protect the rights of citizens,   pointed   out   that   recognition   and   enforcement   of claims   qua   non­State   actors   may   require   legislative intervention.   However,   when   it   comes   to   Article   19,   a Constitution Bench in P.D. Shamdasani vs. Central Bank of India   Ltd.17,  has   held   it   to   be   inapplicable   against   private persons. Question No. 3 (iii) Fundamental rights of citizens enshrined in the Constitution are   not   only   negative   rights   against   the   State   but   also constitute a positive obligation on the State to protect those rights. The Constitution Bench in  State of West Bengal  vs. Committee   for   Protection   of   Democratic   Rights,   West Bengal18,  while   upholding   the   power   of   the   Constitutional Court   to   transfer   an   investigation   to   the   CBI   without   the consent   of  the  concerned  State,  emphasized  the  duty  of  the 15(2000) 6 SCC 213 16(2017) 10 SCC 1 171952 SCR 391 18(2010) 3 SCC 571 15 State to conduct a fair investigation which is a fundamental right of the victim under Article 21.  The majority judgment in Justice  K.S.   Puttaswamy  (supra),   defines   the   positive obligation of the State to ensure the meaningful exercise of the right of privacy. In S. Rangarajan vs. P. Jagjivan Ram19, this Court has categorically laid down that the State cannot plead its inability to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens. In Union of India  vs.  K.M. Shankarappa20,  Section 6(1) of the Cinematograph   Act,   1952   which   granted   the   Central Government,   the   power   to   review   the   decision   of   the   quasi­ judicial Tribunal under the Act, was sought to be defended on the   ground   of   law   and   order.   The   contention   was   rejected holding that it was the duty of the Government to ensure law and   order.   In  Indibly   Creative   Private   Limited  vs. Government   of   West   Bengal21,  the   negative   restraint   and positive obligation under Article 19(1) (a) has been explained. In  Pt. Parmanand Katara  vs.  Union of India22, it was held that even the doctors in Government hospitals are duty bound to fulfil the constitutional obligation of the State under Article 21.  Question No. 4 19(1989) 2 SCC 574 20(2001) 1 SCC 582 21(2020) 12 SCC 436 22(1989) 4 SCC 286 16 (iv)  The Minister being a functionary of the State, represents the State   when   acting   in   his   official   capacity.   Therefore,   any violation   of   the   fundamental   rights   of   the   citizens   by   the Minister in his official capacity, would be attributable to the State. The State also has a positive obligation to protect the rights of citizens under Article 21, whether the violation is by its   own   functionaries   or   a   private   person.   It   would   be preposterous   to   suggest   that   while   the   State   is   under   an obligation   to   restrict   a   private   citizen   from   violating   the fundamental rights of other citizens, its own Minister can do so with impunity. However, the factum of violation would need to be established on the facts of a given case. It would involve a   detailed   inquiry   into   questions   such   as  (a)  whether   the statement by the Minister was made in his personal or official capacity;  (b)  whether the statement was made on a public or private issue; (c) whether the statement was made on a public or private platform. In  Amish Devgan  vs.  Union of India23, while dealing with hate speech, the impact of the speech of “a person of  influence” such as a Government functionary, was explained.  State   of   Maharashtra  vs.  Sarangdharsingh Shivdassingh   Chavan24,  provides   a   clear   instance   of   direct interference   with   the   investigation   by   a   Chief   Minister.   The Court   held   the   action   of   the   Chief   Minister   to   be   \"wholly unconstitutional\" and contrary to the oath of allegiance to the Constitution and imposed costs on the State. The concurring opinion  emphasizes  the  responsibility  that   the  oath  of  office casts on the Minister under the Constitution. In  Secretary, Jaipur   Development   Authority,   Jaipur  vs.  Daulat   Mal 23(2021) 1 SCC 1 24(2011) 1 SCC 577 17 Jain25,   while  dealing   with   a   case   involving   the   misuse   of public   office   by   a   Minister,   this   Court   elaborated   on   the responsibility  and liability of the Ministerial office under  the Constitution. The importance of the Oath of Office under the Constitution was also emphasized by the Constitution Bench in  Manoj   Narula  vs.  Union   of   India26.  However,   the Ministerial code of conduct was held to be not enforceable in a court of law in  R.  Sai Bharathi  vs.  J. Jayalalitha 27,  as it does not have any statutory force. An argument can be made that the Minister is personally bound by the oath of his office to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India under   Articles   75(4)   and   164(3)   of   the   Constitution.   The Constitution imposes a solemn obligation on the Minister as a Constitutional functionary to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens. The code of conduct for Ministers (Both for Union and States) specifically lays down that the Code is in addition to the “. . . observance of the provisions of the Constitution, the Representation   of   the   People   Act,   1951”.   Therefore,   a Constitutional functionary is duty bound to act in a manner which is in consonance with this constitutional obligation of the State. Question No. 5 (v) The   State   acts   through   its   functionaries.   Therefore,   the official act of a Minister which violates the fundamental rights of   the   citizens,   would   make   the   State   liable   under constitutional tort. The principle of sovereign immunity of the 25(1997) 1 SCC 35 26(2014) 9 SCC 1 27(2004) 2 SCC 9 18 State for the tortious acts of its servant, has been held to be inapplicable   in   the   case   of   violation   of   fundamental   rights. The principle of State liability under Constitutional tort was expounded in  Nilabati Behera  (supra).  In  Common Cause, A Registered Society  vs.  Union of India.28,  the position in the case of a public functionary was explained. III.C.  Written submissions of Shri Kaleeswaram Raj, Advocate for the SLP petitioner 11. Shri   Kaleeswaram   Raj,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the petitioner in the special leave petition submitted an elaborate note. This note is divided into several chapters dealing with the nature and extent of the freedom of speech, the restrictions on the same, the   horizontality   of   fundamental   rights,   constitutional   rights   and constitutional values, statements made by Ministers and collective responsibility, self­regulation as the best mode of regulation, hate speech   not   being   a   protected   speech   and   the   way   forward.   The contents of this note are summarized as follows:­ (i) The  Constitutional  mandate   of   freedom   of  expression   and free   speech   is   to   be   preserved   without   imposing unconstitutional   restrictions.   It   is   a   right   available   to everyone including political personalities. 28(1999) 6 SCC 667 19 (ii) But   even   while   upholding   such   a   right,   efforts   should   be taken   to   frame   a   voluntary   code   of   conduct   for   Ministers etc., to ensure better accountability and transparency; (iii) There   is   an   imperative   need   to   evolve   a   device   such   as Ombudsman to act as a Constitutional check on the misuse of the freedom of expression by public functionaries using the apparatus of the State; (iv) The   right   under   Article   19(1)(a)   is   limited   by   restrictions expressly   indicated   in   Article   19(2),   under   which   the restrictions should be reasonable and must be provided for by law, by the State.   Therefore this Court cannot provide for any additional restriction by an interpretative exercise or otherwise; (v) It is too remote to suggest that the right of a victim under Article 21 stands violated if there is a statement by someone that   the   case   was   born   out   of   political   conspiracy. Therefore,   there   is   actually   no   conflict   of   any   other   right with Article 21; (vi) Unlike Article 25 which makes the right thereunder subject to   public   order,   morality   and   health,   Article   19(1)(a)   does not   contain   such   restrictions.   As   held   by   this   Court   in Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. vs. The Union of India29, freedom of speech can be restricted only in the interest of security of 29(1962) 3 SCR 842 20 the State, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency   or   morality   or   in   relation   to   contempt   of   court, defamation   or   incitement   to   an   offence.   It   cannot   be curtailed, in the interest of the general public, as in the case of freedom to carry on business; (vii) Restricting speech by public figures, such as politicians, on serious   crimes   will   have   great   impact   on   the   freedom   of speech.     Such   criticism   which   calls   out   true   conspiracies and true miscarriage of justice, plays an important role in a democracy; (viii) In so far as the enforcement of fundamental rights against non­State   actors   is   concerned,   the   vertical   approach   is giving   way   to   the   concept   of   horizontal   application.   The vertical   approach   connotes   a   situation   where   the enforceability   is   only   against   the   Government   and   not against   private   actors.   But   with   Nation   States   gradually moving from laissez faire governance to welfare governance, the role of the State is ever expanding, which justifies the shift. (ix) While   the   South   African   Constitution   has   adopted   a horizontal application by providing in Section 9(4) of the Bill of Rights of Final Constitution of 1996 that no person may unfairly   discriminate   directly   or   indirectly   against   anyone on one or more grounds in terms of sub­Section (3) which 21 sets out the grounds that bind the State, the judiciary itself has adopted a direct horizontal effect, in Ireland as could be seen   from   the   decisions   in  John   Meskell  vs.   Córas Iompair   Éireann30and  Murtagh   Properties   Limited  vs. Cleary31. In John Meskell (supra), the Irish Supreme Court granted damages against the employer who dismissed the employee for not joining a particular union after serving a due   notice   to   persuade   him.   In  Murtagh   Properties Limited  (supra),   the   High   Court   recognized   and   enforced the   right   to   earn   livelihood   without   any   discrimination based   on   sex   against   a   private   employer.   Countries   like Canada   and   Germany   have   developed   indirect   horizontal application,   meaning   thereby   that   the   rights   regulate   the laws   and   statutes,   which   in   turn   regulate   the   conduct   of citizens; (x) In   the   Indian   context,   direct   horizontal   effect   has   limited application as can be seen from Articles 15(2), 17 and 24; (xi) Paradigm   cases   of   horizontality   should   be   distinguished from ordinary cases. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court held   in  Shelly  vs.  Kraemer32  a   covenant   contained   in   a contract prohibiting the sale of houses in a neighbourhood to  African­Americans, as  unenforceable, for  they  have the effect   of   denying   equal   protection   under   the   laws.   The 301973 IR 121 311972 IR 330 32334 U.S. 1 (1948) 22 Federal Constitutional Court of Germany took a similar view in  L thϋ 33  case   (1958)   where   a   call   for   boycott   of   a   film directed by a person who had worked on anti­semitic Nazi propaganda   was  challenged.  The  German   Court  held  that there was an objective order of values that must affect all spheres of law; (xii) It  has   been   repeatedly   held  by   this   Court  that   the   power under   Article   226   is   available   not   only   against   the Government and its instrumentalities but also against “any person or authority”. A reference may be made in this regard to two decisions namely Praga Tools Corporation vs. Shri C.A.   Imanual34  and  Andi   Mukta   Sadguru   Shree Muktajee   Vandas   Swami   Suvarna   Jayanti   Mahotasav Smarak Trust vs.V.R. Rudani35; (xiii) There   are   several   instances   where  this   Court   has   issued writs   under   Article   32   against   non­State   actors.   Broadly those   cases   fall   under   two   categories,  namely,  (i)  private players   performing   public   duties/functions;   and  (ii)  non­ State actors performing statutory activities that impact the rights   of   citizens.   Cases   which   fall   under   these   two categories have been held by this Court to be amenable to writ jurisdiction as seen from several decisions including 33Luth (1958) BVerfGE 7, 198  34(1969) 1 SCC 585 35(1989) 2 SCC 691 23 M.C.   Mehta  vs.  Union   of   India36.  Absent   any   of   these parameters,   the   Court   has   refused   to   exercise   writ jurisdiction as seen from Binny Ltd. vs. V. Sadasivan.37; (xiv) Even   in   jurisdictions   where   socio   economic   rights   have been elevated in status to that of constitutional rights, the enforcement   of   those   rights   were   made   available   only against the State and not against private actors, as held by this   Court   in  Society   for   Unaided   Private   Schools   of Rajasthan vs. Union of India38; (xv) On the issue of potential conflict of rights, it is important to   bear   in   mind   the   distinction   between   constitutional rights and constitutional values. On a formal level, values are understood teleologically as things to be promoted or maximized.   Rights,   on   the   other   hand,   are   not   to   be promoted   but   rather   to   be   respected.   It   would   not   show proper concern for a right to allow the violation of one right in order to prevent the violation of other rights. This would promote   the   non­violation   of   rights,   but   it   would   not respect rights39; (xvi) Instead   of   values   whose   satisfaction   is   to   be   maximized, rights act as constraints on the actions of the state. They confer individuals with a sphere of liberty that is inviolable. 36 AIR 1987 SC 1086 37 (2005) 6 SCC 657 38 (2012) 6 SCC 1 39 Frances Kamm, Morality, Mortality Vol.2, Oxford University Press, 1996 24 Rights   thereby   act   as   restrictions   on   the   government   on how to pursue values, including constitutional values. It is, therefore,   crucially   important   that   we   draw   a   distinction between   the   constitutional   rights   and   constitutional values. Not every increase in liberty or every improvement in   leading   a   dignified   life   is   a   constitutional   right.   This position has been accepted by this Court; (xvii) As held by this Court in  Justice  K.S.  Puttaswamy, the Court will strike a balance, wherever a conflict between two sets of fundamental rights is projected. Strictly speaking, what is actually conceived by some and noted in several decisions including  Justice  K.S. Puttaswamy, is not the conflict of rights in abstractum, at a doctrinal level, but the conflict in the notion/invocation/practice of rights; (xviii) On   the   issue   of   statements   made   by   Ministers   and collective   responsibility,   a   reference   has   to   be   made   to Articles   75(3)   and   164(2).     Both   these   Articles   speak   of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers. Though the language employed in these Articles indicate that such a   collective   responsibility   is   to   the   House   of   the   People/ Legislative Assembly, it is actually a responsibility to the people   at   large.   Since   every   utterance   by   a   Minister   will have   a   direct   bearing   on   the   policy   of   the   Government, there   is   an   imperative   need   for   a   voluntary   code   of conduct. As pointed out by this Court in  Common Cause 25 (supra), collective responsibility has two meanings, namely, (i)  that   all   members   of   the   Council   of   Ministers   are unanimous   in   support   of   its   policies   and   exhibit   such unanimity in public; and  (ii)  that they are personally and morally responsible for its success and failure; (xix) Individual aberrations on the part of Ministers are serious threats to constitutional governance and as such the head of the Council of Ministers has a duty to ensure that such breaches do not happen; (xx) A code of conduct to self­regulate the speeches and actions of   Ministers   is   constitutionally   justifiable   and   this   Court can definitely examine its requirement. Ideally, a Minister is   not   supposed   to   breach   his   collective   responsibility towards the Cabinet and the Legislature and hence, it is advisable to have a cogent code of conduct as occurring in advanced democracies; (xxi) While it is not possible to impose additional restrictions on the freedom of speech, it is certainly desirable to have a code   of   conduct   for   public   functionaries,   as   followed   in other jurisdictions.   The Court may keep in mind the fact that   this   Court   in  Sahara   India   Real   Estate Corporation   Limited  (supra)  cautioned   against   framing guidelines across the board to restrict the freedom of Press; 26 (xxii) Coming to hate speeches, there has been a steep increase in   the   number   of   hate   speeches   since   2014.   From   May­ 2014 to date, there have been 124 reported instances of derogatory   speeches   by   45   politicians.   Social   media platforms have connived the proliferation of targeted hate speech.   Such   speeches   provide   fertile   ground   for incitement to violence; (xxiii)  On  the role of  the  Court in  dealing  with  the  question  of hate speech, the decisions in Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan vs.  Union   of   India40;  Kodungallur   Film   Society  vs. Union   of   India41and  Amish   Devgan  (supra)   lay   down broad parameters; (xxiv)   At the international level, the definition of hate speech was formulated in the UN Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech, to mean “… any kind of communication in speech, writing or behavior,   that   attacks   or   uses   pejorative   or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words,   based   on   their   religion,   ethnicity, nationality,   race,   colour,   descent,   gender   or   other identity factor.” The   Role   and   Responsibilities   of   Political   Leaders   in Combating   Hate   Speech   and   Intolerance   (Provisional version)   dated   12   March   2019,   was   submitted   by   the 40 (2014) 11 SCC 477 41 (2018) 10 SCC 713 27 Committee   on   Equality   and   Non­Discrimination   to   the Parliamentary   Assembly   of   the   Council   of   Europe.   The Assembly passed the resolution adopting the text proposed by rapporteur Ms. Elvira Kovacs, Serbia; (xxv)   Finally, the way forward is, (i) for the legislature to adopt a voluntary model code of conduct for persons holding public offices,   which   would   reflect   Constitutional   morality   and values   of   good   governance;   and  (ii)  the   creation   of   an appropriate   mechanism   such   as   Ombudsman,   in accordance with the Venice principles and Paris principles. Till such an Ombudsman is constituted, the National and State Human Rights Commissions have to take pro­active measures,   in   terms   of   the   provisions   of   Protection   of Human Rights Act, 1993. IV. Discussion and Analysis Question No. 1 12. Question   No.1   referred   to   us,   is   as   to   whether   the   grounds specified in Article 19(2) in relation to which reasonable restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed by law are exhaustive, or can restrictions on the right to free speech be imposed on grounds not found in Article 19(2) by invoking other fundamental rights? 28 History of evolution of clause (2) of Article 19 13. For finding an answer to this question, it may be necessary and   even   relevant   to   take   a   peep   into   history.   Since   Dr.   B.R. Ambedkar’s original draft in this regard followed Article 40(6) of the Irish   Constitution,   the   original   draft   of   the   Advisory   Committee included   restrictions   such   as   public   order,   morality,   sedition, obscenity,   blasphemy   and   defamation.   Sardar   Vallabhbhai   Patel suggested the inclusion of libel also.  These restrictions were sought to be justified by citing the decision in Gitlow vs. New York42. 14. Since the country had witnessed large scale communal riots at that   time,   Sir   Alladi   Krishnaswamy   Iyer   forcefully   argued   for   the inclusion of security and defence of the State or national security as one of the restrictions.  Discussion also took place about restricting speech   that   is   intended   to   spoil   communal   harmony   and   speech which is seditious in nature. With suggestions, counter suggestions and   objections   so   articulated,   the   initial   report   of   the   Sub­ Committee on Fundamental Rights underwent a lot of changes. The evolution of clauses (1) and (2) of Article 19 stage by stage, from the 42 286 US 652 (1925) 29 time when the draft report was submitted in April 1947, upto the time   when   the   Constitution   was   adopted,   can   be   presented   in   a tabular form43 as follows: Draft Provision Draft   Report   of   the Subcommittee   on Fundamental   Rights,   April 1947 (BSR II, 139) 9.   There   shall   be   liberty   for   the   exercise  of the   following   rights   subject   to   public   order and morality:  (a)   The   right   of   every   citizen   to   freedom   of speech   and   expression.   The   publication   or utterance of seditious, obscene, slanderous, libellous   or   defamatory   matter   shall   be actionable or punishable in accordance with law. Final   Report   of   the   Sub­ Committee   on   Fundamental Rights,   April   1947   (BSR   II, 172) 10. There shall be liberty for the exercise of the   following   rights   subject   to   public   order and   morality   or   to   the   existence   of   grave emergency   declared   to   be   such   by   the Government   of   the   Union   or   the   unit concerned whereby the security of the Union or the unit, as the case may be. Interim   Report   of   the Advisory   Committee,   April 30, 1947 There shall be liberty for the exercise of the following rights subject  to public order  and morality   or   to   the   existence   of   grave emergency   declared   to   be   such   by   the Government   of   the   Union   or   the   Unit concerned whereby the security of the Union or   the   Unit,   as   the   case   may   be,   is threatened: (a) The   right   of   every   citizen   to   freedom   of speech and expression:  Provision may be made by law to make the publication   or   utterance   of   seditious, obscene, blasphemous, slanderous, libellous or   defamatory   matter   actionable   or punishable. Draft   Constitution   prepared 15. (1) There shall be liberty for the exercise 43  Sourced   from   the   article   “Arguments   from   Colonial   Continuity­   the   Constitution   (First Amendment)   Act,   1951”   (2008)   of   Burra,   Arudra,   Assistant   Professor,   Department   of Humanities and Social Sciences , IIT (Delhi),  30 by  B.  N.  Rau,  October  1947 (BSR III, 8­9) of the following rights subject to public order and morality, namely: (a)   the   right   of   every   citizen   to   freedom   of speech and expression;  …  (2) Nothing in this section shall restrict the power of the State to make any law or to take any   executive   action   which   under   this Constitution it has power to make or to take, during   the   period   when   a   Proclamation   of Emergency   issued   under   sub­section   (I)   of section 182 is in force, or, in the case of a unit   during   the   period   of   any   grave emergency   declared   by   the   Government   of the unit whereby the security of the unit is threatened. Draft   Constitution   prepared by   the   Drafting   Committee and   submitted   to   the President   of   the   Constituent Assembly,   February   1948 (BSR III, 522) 13. (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Article, all citizens shall have the right –  (a) to freedom of speech and expression;  …  (2) Nothing in sub­clause (a) of clause (1) of this Article shall affect the operation of any existing   law,   or   prevent   the   State   from making   any   law,   relating   to   libel,   slander, defamation,   sedition   or  any   other   matter which   offends   against   decency   or morality or undermines the authority or foundation of the State. Proposal   introduced   in   the Constituent   Assembly   in October 1948 (BSR IV, 39)  13. (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Article, all citizens shall have the right –  (a) to freedom of speech and expression;  …  (2) Nothing in sub­clause (a) of clause (1) of this article shall affect the operation of any existing   law,   or   prevent   the   State   from making   any   law,   relating   to   libel,   slander, defamation,   sedition   or   any   other   matter which offends against decency or morality or undermines   the   security   of,   or   tends   to overthrow, the State. 31 Revised   Draft   Constitution, introduced   and   adopted   in November   1949   (BSR   IV, 755) 19. (1) All citizens shall have the right ­­­  (a) to freedom of speech and expression;  …  (2)   Nothing   in   sub­clause   (a)   of   clause   (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or prevent the State from   making   any   law   relating   to,   libel, slander,   defamation,   contempt   of   Court   or any matter which offends against decency or morality   or   which   undermines   the   security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. 15. Immediately after the adoption of the Constitution, this Court had an occasion to deal with a challenge to an order passed by the Government   of   Madras   in   exercise   of   the   powers   conferred   by Section   9(1­A)   of   the   Madras   Maintenance   of   Public   Order   Act, 194944, banning the entry and circulation of a weekly journal called ‘Cross Roads’ printed and published in Bombay. The ban order was challenged   on   the   ground   that   it   was   violative   of   Article   19(1)(a). The validity of the statutory provision under which the ban order was issued, was also attacked on the basis of Article 13(1) of the Constitution.   A   Seven   Member   Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court, while  upholding   the challenge  in  Romesh  Thappar  vs.  State   of Madras45 held as follows: ­ 44 1949 Act 45 AIR 1950 SC 124 32 “[12]  We   are   therefore   of   opinion   that   unless   a   law restricting   freedom   of   speech   and   expression   is directed solely against the undermining of the security of the State or the overthrow of it, such law cannot fall within   the   reservation   under   clause   (2)   of Art.   19, although the restrictions which it seeks to impose may have been conceived generally in the interests of public order. …”  16. An argument was advanced in Romesh Thappar (supra) that Section 9(1­A) of the 1949 Act could not be considered wholly void, as   the   securing   of   public   safety   or   maintenance   of   public   order would include the security of the State and that therefore the said provision, as applied to the latter purpose was covered by Article 19(2).  However, the said argument was rejected on the ground that where a law purports to authorise the imposition of restrictions on a fundamental right, in language wide enough to cover restrictions, both   within   or   without   the   limits   of   Constitutionally   permissible legislative action affecting such right, it is not possible to uphold it even so far as it may be applied within the Constitutional limits, as it is not severable. 17. On the same date on which the decision in Romesh Thappar was delivered, the Constitution Bench of this Court also delivered another judgment in Brij Bhushan vs. The State of Delhi46. It also 46 AIR 1950 SC 129 33 arose out of a writ petition under Article 32 challenging an order passed by the Chief Commissioner of Delhi in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 7(1)(c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, requiring the Printer and the Publisher  as well as the Editor of an English weekly by name ‘Organizer’, to submit for scrutiny, before   publication,   all   communal   matters   and   news   and   views about   Pakistan   including   photographs   and   cartoons,   other   than those   derived   from   the   official   sources.   Following   the   decision   in Romesh Thappar, the Constitution Bench held that the imposition of pre­censorship on a journal is a restriction on the liberty of the Press, which is an essential part of the right to freedom of speech and expression. The Bench went on to hold that Section 7(1)(c) of the  East  Punjab  Public  Safety  Act,  1949 does  not  fall  within  the reservation of clause (2) of Article 19. 18. After aforesaid two decisions, the Parliament sought to amend the Constitution through the Constitution (First Amendment) Bill, 1951.   In   the   Statement   of   Objects   and   Reasons   to   the   First Amendment, it was indicated that the citizen's right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) has been held 34 by some Courts to be so comprehensive as not to render a person culpable, even if he advocates murder and other crimes of violence. Incidentally,   the   First   Amendment   also   dealt   with   other   issues, about which we are not concerned in this discussion.  Clause (2) of Article 19 was substituted by a new clause under the Constitution (First   Amendment)   Act,   1951.   For   easy   appreciation   of   the metamorphosis that clause (2) of Article 19 underwent after the first amendment, we present in a tabular column, Article 19(2) pre­first amendment and post­first amendment as under: ­ Pre­First   Amendment   –   Article 19(2) Post­First   Amendment   –   Article 19(2) (2) Nothing in sub­clause (a) of clause (1)   shall   affect   the   operation   of   any existing law in so far as it relates to, or   prevents   the   State   from   making any   law   relating   to,   libel,   slander, defamation, contempt of court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. (2)   Nothing   in   sub­clause   (a)   of clause (1) shall affect the operation of   any   existing   law,   or   prevent   the State from making any law, in so far as   such   law   imposes   reasonable restrictions   on   the   exercise   of   the right   conferred   by   the   said   sub­ clause   in   the   interests   of   the security   of   the   State,   friendly relations with foreign States, public order,   decency   or   morality,   or   in relation   to   contempt   of   court, defamation   or   incitement   to   an offence. 19. It is significant to note that Section 3(1)(a) of the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, declared that the newly substituted 35 clause (2) of Article 19 shall be deemed always to have been enacted   in   the   amended   form,   meaning   thereby   that   the amended clause (2) was given retrospective effect. 20. Another important feature to be noted in the amended clause (2)   of   Article   19   is   the   inclusion   of   the   words   ‘reasonable restrictions’. Thus, the test of reasonableness was introduced by the first amendment and the same fell for jural exploration within no time, in State of Madras vs. V.G. Row47.  The said case arose out of a judgment of the Madras High Court quashing a Government Order declaring a society known as ‘People’s Education Society’ as an   unlawful   association   and   also   declaring   as   unconstitutional, Section 15(2)(b) of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908, as amended by the Indian Criminal Law Amendment (Madras) Act, 1950. While upholding the judgment of the Madras High Court, this Court   indicated   as   to   how   the   test   of   reasonableness   has   to   be expounded.  The relevant portion of the judgment reads as follows: ­ “23. It is important in this context to bear in mind that the   test   of   reasonableness,   wherever   prescribed, should be applied to each individual statute impugned, and   no   abstract   standard,   or   general   pattern   of 47(1952) 1 SCC 410 36 reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases. The nature of the right alleged to have been infringed,   the   underlying   purpose   of   the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil   sought   to   be   remedied   thereby,   the disproportion   of   the   imposition,   the   prevailing conditions   at   the   time,   should   all   enter   into   the judicial verdict. In evaluating such elusive factors and   forming   their   own   conception   of   what   is reasonable,   in   all   the   circumstances   of   a   given case, it is inevitable that the social philosophy and the   scale   of   values   of   the   Judges  participating   in the decision should play an important part, and the limit   to   their   interference   with   legislative judgment   in   such   cases   can   only   be   dictated   by their sense of responsibility and self­restraint and the   sobering   reflection   that   the   Constitution   is meant not only for people of their way of thinking but   for   all,   and   that   the   majority   of   the   elected representatives of the people have, in authorizing the imposition of the restrictions, considered them to be reasonable.” 21. After   the   First   Amendment   to   the   Constitution,   the   country witnessed   cries   for   secession,   with   parochial   tendencies   showing their   ugly   head,   especially   from   a   southern   State.   Therefore,   a National   Integration   Conference   was   convened   in   September­ October,   1961   to   find   ways   and   means   to   combat   the   evils   of communalism,   casteism,   regionalism,   linguism   and   narrow mindedness.   This   Conference   decided   to   set   up   the   National Integration   Council.   Accordingly,   it   was   constituted   in   1962.   The constitution of the Council assumed significance in the wake of the 37 Sino­India   war   in   1962.   This   National   Integration   Council   had   a Committee on national integration and regionalism. This Committee recommended two amendments to the Constitution, namely, (i) the amendment of clause (2) of Article 19 so as to include the words “the sovereignty and integrity of India” as one of the restrictions; and (ii)  the amendment of 8 Forms of oath or affirmation contained in the Third Schedule. Until 1963, no one taking a constitutional oath was required to swear that they would “uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India”. But, the Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act, 1963 expanded the forms of oath to ensure that “every candidate for the membership of a State Legislature or Parliament, and every aspirant to, and incumbent of, public office” – to quote its Statement of   Objects   and   Reasons   –   “pledges   himself   .   .   .   to   preserve   the integrity   and   sovereignty   of   the   Union   of   India.”  Thus,   by   the Constitution   (Sixteenth   Amendment)   Act,   1963,   “the   sovereignty and   integrity   of   India”,   was   included   as   an   additional   ground   of restriction on the right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a). 22. Having seen the history of evolution of clause (2) of Article 19, let us now turn to the first question.  38 Two parts of Question No.1 23. Question No.1 is actually in two parts.  The first part raises a poser   as   to   whether   reasonable   restrictions   on   the   right   to   free speech enumerated in Article 19(2) could be said to be exhaustive. The   second   part   of   the   Question   raises   a   debate   as   to   whether additional restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed on grounds not found in Article 19(2), by invoking other fundamental rights. First part of Question No.1 24. The judicial history of the evolution of clause (2) of Article 19 which we have captured above shows that lot of deliberations went into the articulation of the restrictions now enumerated. The draft Report   of   the   Sub­Committee   on   Fundamental   Rights   itself underwent several changes until the Constitution was adopted in November, 1949. In the form in which the Constitution was adopted in   1949,   the   restrictions   related   to  (i)  libel;  (ii)  slander;  (iii) defamation;  (iv)  contempt   of   court;  (v)  any   matter   which   offends 39 against decency or morality; and (vi) any matter which undermines the security of the State or tends to overthrow the State. 25. After   the   1st  and   16th  Amendments,   the   emphasis   is   on reasonable  restrictions  relating   to,  (i)  interests  of  sovereignty  and integrity of India; (ii) the security of the State; (iii) friendly relations with   foreign   states;  (iv)  public   order;  (v)  decency   or   morality;  (vi) contempt   of   court;  (vii)  defamation;   and  (viii)  incitement   to   an offence.  26. A careful look at these eight heads of restrictions would show that they save the existing laws and enable the State to make   laws,   restricting   free   speech   with   a   view   to   afford protection to (i) individuals (ii) groups of persons (iii) sections of society (iv) classes of citizens (v) the Court (vi) the State and (vii) the country. This can be demonstrated by providing in a table, the provisions of the Indian Penal Code that make some speech or expression a punishable offence, thereby impeding the right to free speech,   the   heads   of   restriction   under   which   they   fall   and   the 40 category/class   of   person/persons   sought   to   be   protected   by   the restriction: Table of Provisions under IPC restricting freedom of speech and expression Laws   restricting   free speech Heads   of   Restriction traceable to Article 19(2) Person/Class   of   Person sought   to   be   protected and   the   nature   of protection.  Section   117   of   the   IPC ­Abetting   commission   of offence by the public or by more   than   ten   persons.

We have taken note of, in the above Table, only the provisions of the  Indian  Penal Code that  curtail  free speech. There are also other special enactments such as The Scheduled Castes and The 44 Scheduled   Tribes   (Prevention   of   Atrocities)   Act,   1989,   The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 etc., which also impose   certain   restrictions   on   free   speech.   From   these   it   will   be clear that the eight heads of restrictions contained in clause (2) of Article 19 are so exhaustive that  the laws made for the purpose of protection of the individual, sections of society, classes of citizens, court, the country and the State have been saved.  28. The   restrictions   under   clause   (2)   of   Article   19   are comprehensive   enough   to   cover   all   possible   attacks   on   the individual,   groups/classes   of   people,   the   society,   the   court,   the country and the State. This is why this Court repeatedly held that any restriction which does not fall within the four corners of Article 19(2)   will   be   unconstitutional.   For   instance,   it   was   held   by   the Constitution Bench in Express Newspapers (Private) Ltd. vs. The Union of India49, that a law enacted by the legislature, which does not   come   squarely   within   Article   19(2)   would   be   struck   down   as unconstitutional. Again, in  Sakal Papers  (supra), this Court held that   the   State   cannot   make   a   law   which   directly   restricts   one freedom even for securing the better enjoyment of another freedom. 491959 SCR 12 45 29. That the Executive cannot transgress its limits by imposing an additional   restriction   in   the   form   of   Executive   or   Departmental instruction was emphasised by this Court in  Bijoe Emmanuel  vs. State   of   Kerala50.  The   Court   made   it   clear   that   the   reasonable restrictions sought to be imposed must be through “a law” having statutory   force   and   not   a   mere   Executive   or   Departmental instruction.  The   restraint   upon   the   Executive   not   to   have   a back­door   intrusion   applies   equally   to   Courts.  While   Courts may   be   entitled   to   interpret   the   law   in   such   a   manner   that   the rights existing in blue print have expansive connotations, the Court cannot   impose   additional   restrictions   by   using   tools   of interpretation. What this Court can do and how far it can afford to go,   was   articulated   by   B.   Sudharshan   Reddy,   J.,   in  Ram Jethmalani (supra) as follows: “85.   An   argument   can   be   made   that   this   Court   can make   exceptions   under   the   peculiar   circumstances   of this case, wherein the State has acknowledged that it has not acted with the requisite speed and vigour in the case   of   large   volumes   of   suspected   unaccounted   for monies   of   certain   individuals.   There   is   an   inherent danger in making exceptions to fundamental principles and rights on the fly. Those exceptions, bit by bit, would then   eviscerate   the   content   of   the   main   right   itself. 50(1986) 3 SCC 615 46 Undesirable lapses in upholding of fundamental rights by the legislature, or the executive, can be rectified by assertion   of   constitutional   principles   by   this   Court. However,   a   decision   by   this   Court   that   an   exception could be carved out remains permanently as a part of judicial canon, and becomes a part of the constitutional interpretation   itself.   It   can   be   used   in   the   future   in   a manner and form that may far exceed what this Court intended or what the constitutional text and values can bear. We are not proposing that Constitutions cannot be interpreted in a manner that allows the nation­State to tackle   the   problems   it   faces.   The   principle   is   that exceptions cannot be carved out willy­nilly, and without forethought as to the damage they may cause. 86.One   of   the   chief   dangers   of   making   exceptions   to principles that have become a part of constitutional law, through   aeons   of   human   experience,  is   that   the   logic, and   ease   of   seeing   exceptions,   would   become entrenched as a part  of the constitutional order. Such logic   would   then   lead   to   seeking   exceptions,   from protective walls of all fundamental rights, on grounds of expediency   and   claims   that   there   are   no   solutions   to problems   that   the   society   is   confronting   without   the evisceration   of   fundamental   rights.   That   same   logic could   then   be   used   by   the   State   in   demanding exceptions   to   a   slew   of   other   fundamental   rights, leading   to   violation   of   human   rights   of   citizens   on   a massive scale.” 30. Again,   in  Secretary,   Ministry   of   Information   & Broadcasting,   Govt.   of   India  vs.  Cricket   Association   of Bengal51, this Court cautioned that the restrictions on free speech can   be   imposed   only   on   the   basis   of   Article   19(2).   In  Ramlila Maidan   Incident,   in   re.52,  this  Court  developed  a  three­pronged 51(1995) 2 SCC 161 52 (2012) 5 SCC 1 47 test namely, (i) that the restriction can be imposed only by or under the authority of law and not by exercise of the executive power; (ii) that   such   restriction   must   be   reasonable;   and  (iii)  that   the restriction must be related to the purposes mentioned in clause (2) of Article 19.  31. That the eight heads of restrictions contained in clause (2) of Article   19   are   exhaustive   can   be   established   from   another perspective   also.   The   nature   of   the   restrictions   on   free   speech imposed by law/judicial pronouncements even in countries where a higher threshold is maintained, are almost similar. To drive home this point, we are presenting in the following table, a comparative note relating to different jurisdictions: Jurisdiction The   Document from   which   the Right to Freedom of   Speech   and Expression flows The   Document from   which   the restrictions   on the   right   to freedom   of Speech   and Expression flow Nature   of Restrictions India Article   19(1)(a)   ­ Constitution   of India Article   19(2)   ­ Constitution   of India 1.

USA First   Amendment to   the   US Constitution  No   restriction   is specifically provided   in   the Constitution.   But Judicial Review by the Supreme Court has   admitted certain restrictions Recognised   forms   of Unprotected Speech: 1.  Obscenity  as   held in   Roth   v.   United States, 354 U.S. 476, 483 (1957). 2.Child   Pornography as held in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 435 U.S. 234 (2002). 3.   Fighting   Words 49 and   True   Threat  as held in Chaplinsky  v. New   Hampshire,   315 U.S.   568   (1942)   and Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 363 (2003), respectively. Australia  Australian Constitution   does not   expressly speak   about freedom   of expression. However,   the   High Court   has   held that   an   implied freedom of political communication exists   as   an indispensible   part of   the   system   of representative   and responsible government created   by   the Constitution.   It operates   as   a freedom   from government restraint,   rather than   a   right conferred   directly on   individuals. Australia is a party to   seven   core international human   rights treaties.   The   right to   freedom   of opinion   and expression   is contained   in Articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant   on   Civil and   Political Rights (ICCPR)and  Articles 4 and 5 of 1. Article 19(3), 20 of   the   ICCPR contains mandatory limitations   on freedom   of expression,   and requires countries, subject   to reservation/declar ation,   to   outlaw vilification   of persons   on national,   racial   or religious   grounds. Australia   has made a declaration in   relation   to Article   20   to   the effect  that  existing Commonwealth and   state legislation   is regarded   as adequate, and that the   right   is reserved   not   to introduce   any further   legislation imposing   further restrictions   on these matters. 2.   Criminal   Code Act 1995 3.   Racial Discrimination Act 1975 Under   International Treaties: 1.

Since the eight heads of restrictions contained in clause (2) of Article 19 seek to protect:  (i)  the   individual   –   against   the   infringement   of   his   dignity, reputation, bodily autonomy and property;  (ii)  different sections of society professing and practicing, different religious   beliefs/sentiments   ­   against   offending   their   beliefs   and sentiments;  (iii) classes/groups of citizens belonging to different races, linguistic identities etc.­ against an attack on their identities;  (iv)  women   and   children   –   against   the   violation   of   their   special rights;  (v) the State ­ against the breach of its security;  (vi) the country ­ against an attack on its sovereignty and integrity; (vii) the Court – against an attempt to undermine its authority,  we think that the restrictions contained in clause (2) of Article 19 are exhaustive and no further restriction need to be incorporated. 33. In   any   event,   the   law   imposing   any   restriction   in   terms   of clause (2) of Article 19 can only be made by the State and not by 52 the Court. The role envisaged in the Constitutional scheme for the Court, is to be a gate­keeper (and a conscience keeper) to check   strictly   the   entry   of   restrictions,   into   the   temple   of fundamental   rights.   The   role   of   the   Court   is   to   protect fundamental rights limited by lawful restrictions and not to protect   restrictions   and   make   the   rights   residual   privileges. Clause (2) of Article 19 saves  (i)  the operation of any existing law; and (ii) the making of any law by the State. Therefore, it is not for us to add one or more restrictions than what is already found. Second part of Question No.1 34. The second part of Question No.1 is as to whether additional restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed on grounds not found in Article 19(2) by invoking other fundamental rights. 35. This   part   of   Question   No.1   already   stands   partly   answered while dealing with the first part of Question No.1.  The decisions of this   Court   in  Express   Newspapers   (Private)   Ltd.  (supra),   the Cricket   Association   of   Bengal  (supra)  and  Ramlila   Maidan 53 Incident, in re. (supra), provide a complete answer to the question whether additional restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed on grounds not found in Article 19(2). 36. The   question   whether   additional   restrictions   can   peep   into Article   19(2),   by   invoking   other   fundamental   rights,   also   stands answered   by   this  Court   in  Sakal   Papers.  In  Sakal   Papers,  the Central Government issued an order called Daily Newspaper (Price and Page) Order, 1960 in exercise of the power conferred under the Newspaper (Price and Page) Act, 1956, fixing the maximum number of pages that might be published by a newspaper according to the price   charged.   Therefore,   the   publisher   of   a   Marathi   Newspaper challenged the constitutionality of both the Act and the Order.  One of the arguments raised on behalf of the State in the said case was that there are two aspects of the activities of newspapers namely, (i)  the   dissemination   of   news   and   views;   and  (ii)  the   commercial aspect.  While the former would fall under Article 19(1)(a), the latter would fall under Article 19(1)(g).   37. Since   these   two   rights   are   independent   and   since   the restrictions on the right under Article 19(1)(g) can be placed in the 54 interest of the general public under Article 19(6), it was contended by the State in Sakal Papers that the Act and the Order are saved by clause (6) of Article 19. But the said argument of the State was rejected   by   the   Constitution   Bench   in  Sakal   Papers,  in   the following words: “It may well be within the power of the State to place, in the interest of the general public, restrictions upon the right of a citizen to carry on business but it is not open to the State to achieve this object by directly and immediately   curtailing   any   other   freedom   of   that citizen   guaranteed   by   the   Constitution   and   which   is not susceptible of abridgement on the same grounds as are set out in cl. (6) of Art. 19.  Therefore, the right of freedom of speech cannot be taken away with the object of placing restrictions on the business activities of a citizen. Freedom of speech can be restricted only in   the   interests   of   the   security   of   the   State,   friendly relations with foreign State, public order, decency  or morality   or   in   relation   to   contempt   of   court, defamation or incitement to an offence. It cannot, like the freedom to carry on business, be curtailed in the interest   of   the   general   public.  If   a   law   directly affecting it is challenged it is no answer that the restrictions enacted by it are justifiable under cls. (3)   to   (6).   For,   the   scheme   of   Art.   19   is   to enumerate different freedoms separately and then to specify the extent of restrictions to which they may   be   subjected   and   the   objects   for   securing which this could be done. A citizen is entitled to enjoy each and every one of the freedoms together and cl. (1) does not prefer one freedom to another. That   is   the   plain   meaning   of   this   clause.   It follows   from   this   that   the   State   cannot   make   a law which directly restricts one freedom even for securing the better enjoyment of another freedom. All the greater reason, therefore, for holding that 55 the State cannot directly restrict one freedom by placing   an   otherwise   permissible   restriction   on another freedom.” 38. We are conscious of the fact that  Sakal Papers  was a case where the petitioner before the Court had two different fundamental rights   and   the   law   made   by   the   State   fell   within   the   permitted restrictions   upon   the   exercise   of   one   of   those   two   fundamental rights.  However, the restriction traceable to clause (6) of Article 19 was   not   available   in   clause   (2)   of   Article   19.   It   is   in   such circumstances   that   this   Court   held   that   the   restriction   validly imposed   upon   the   exercise   of   one   fundamental   right   cannot automatically become valid while dealing with another fundamental right   of   the   same   person,   the   restriction   of   which   stands Constitutionally on different parameters. 39. In  Sakal   Papers  the   conflict   was   neither   between   one individual’s   fundamental   right  qua  another   individual’s fundamental   right   nor   one   fundamental   right  qua  another fundamental   right   of  the   same  individual.  It  was   a  case  where   a restriction validly made upon a fundamental right was held invalid qua another fundamental right of the same individual.  In the cases 56 on hand, what is sought to be projected is a possible conflict arising out of the exercise of a fundamental right by one individual, in a manner infringing upon the free exercise of the fundamental right of another person. But this conflict is age old. 40. The exercise of all fundamental rights by all citizens is possible only   when   each   individual   respects   the   other   person’s   rights.   As acknowledged   by   the   learned   Attorney   General   and   Ms.   Aparjita Singh,   learned  Amicus,   this   Court   has   always   struck   a   balance whenever it was found that the exercise of fundamental rights by an individual, caused inroads into the space available for the exercise of fundamental rights by another individual. The emphasis even in the Preamble on “fraternity” is an indication that the survival of all fundamental   rights   and   the   survival   of   democracy   itself   depends upon mutual respect, accommodation and willingness to co­exist in peace and tranquility on the part of the citizens.  Let us now see a few examples. The Fundamental Duty enjoined upon every citizen of the   country   under   Article   51­A   (e)   to  “promote   harmony   and   the spirit   of   common   brotherhood   amongst   all   the   people   of   India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities 57 and   to   renounce   practices   derogatory   to   the   dignity   of   women”,   is also an indicator that no one can exercise his fundamental right in a manner that infringes upon the fundamental right of another.  41. As articulated by Jeevan Reddy, J. in Cricket Association of Bengal,  no one can exercise his right of speech in such a manner as to violate another man’s right. In paragraph 152 of the decision in Cricket Association of Bengal, Jeevan Reddy, J. said : “Indeed it  may  be  the  duty of  the  State  to  ensure  that  this   right  is available to all in equal measure and that  it is not hijacked by  a   few   to   the   detriment   of   the   rest.   This   obligation  flows from the Preamble to our Constitution, which seeks to secure all   its   citizens   liberty   of   thought,   expression,   belief   and worship………...Under our Constitutional scheme, the State is not   merely   under   an   obligation   to   respect   the   fundamental rights guaranteed by Part­III but under an equal obligation to ensure conditions in which those rights can be meaningfully and effectively enjoyed by one and all.” 58 42.  The   above   passage   from   the   opinion   of   Jeevan   Reddy,   J.,   in Cricket Association of Bengal,  was quoted with approval by the Constitution   Bench   in  Sahara   India   Real   Estate   Corporation Limited case.  43. There are several instances where this Court either struck a balance   or   placed   on   a   slightly   higher   pedestal,   the   fundamental right   of   one   over   that   of   the   other.   Interestingly,   the   competing claims arose in many of those cases, in the context of Article 19(1) (a) right of one person  qua  Article 21 right of another. Let us now take a look at some of them.  (i)  In R. Rajagopal (supra), the rights pitted against one another were the freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a) and the right to privacy of the Officers of the Government under Article 21. This Court propounded:  “26.   We   may   now   summarise   the   broad   principles flowing from the above discussion: (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21. It is a \"right to be let alone\". A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child­bearing and education   among   other   matters.   None   can   publish anything   concerning   the   above   matters   without   his consent — whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory   or   critical.   If   he   does   so,   he   would   be 59 violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages. Position may,   however,   be   different,   if   a   person   voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy. (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any   publication   concerning   the   aforesaid   aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication is based upon   public   records   including   court   records.   This   is for the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer subsists and   it   becomes   a   legitimate   subject   for   comment   by press   and   media   among   others.   We   are,   however,   of the   opinion   that   in   the   interests   of   decency   [Article 19(2)] an   exception   must   be   carved   out   to   this   rule, viz.,   a   female   who   is   the   victim   of   a   sexual   assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be   subjected   to   the   indignity   of   her   name   and   the incident being publicised in press/media. (3)   There   is   yet   another   exception   to   the   rule   in   (1) above   —   indeed,   this   is   not   an   exception   but   an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious,   right   to   privacy,   or   for   that   matter,   the remedy  of action for  damages is simply not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the   publication   is   based   upon   facts   and   statements which are not true, unless the official establishes that the   publication   was   made   (by   the   defendant)   with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or media)   to   prove   that   he   acted   after   a   reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove   that   what   he   has   written   is   true.   Of   course, where   the   publication   is   proved   to   be   false  and actuated   by   malice   or   personal   animosity,   the defendant would have no defence and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant   to   the   discharge   of   his   duties,   the   public official enjoys the same protection as any other citizen, as   explained   in   (1)   and   (2)   above.   It   needs   no reiteration   that   judiciary,   which   is   protected   by   the power to punish for contempt of court and Parliament 60 and   legislatures   protected   as   their   privileges   are   by Articles 105 and 104 respectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions to this rule. (4) So far as the Government, local authority and other organs and institutions exercising governmental power are   concerned,   they   cannot   maintain   a   suit   for damages for defaming them. (5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that Official Secrets   Act,   1923,   or   any   similar   enactment   or provision   having   the   force   of   law   does   not   bind   the press or media. (6) There is no law empowering the State or its officials to   prohibit,   or   to   impose   a   prior   restraint   upon   the press/media.” (ii)  In  People’s   Union   for   Civil   Liberties   (PUCL)  (supra),  the rights that were perceived as competing with each other were the   right   to   privacy   of   the   spouse   of   a   candidate   contesting election  qua  the  voter’s right to information.  In his separate but   near   concurring   opinion,   P.   Venkatarama   Reddi,   J. articulated the position thus: “121. … …When there is a competition between the right to privacy   of   an   individual   and   the   right   to information of the citizen, the former right has to be subordinated to the latter right as it serves the larger public interest. …” (iii)  In  Noise   Pollution   (V.),   in   Re  (supra),  the   rights   that competed   with   one   another,   were   the   rights   enshrined   in Article   19(1)(a)   and   Article   21.   The   clash   was  between 61 individuals and the persons in the neighborhood. This Court held: “11.  Those   who   make   noise   often   take   shelter behind Article 19(1)(a) pleading freedom of speech and right   to   expression.   Undoubtedly,   the   freedom   of speech and right to expression are fundamental rights but   the rights  are  not  absolute.  Nobody  can  claim  a fundamental   right   to   create   noise   by   amplifying   the sound   of   his   speech   with   the   help   of   loudspeakers. While one has a right to speech, others have a right to listen or decline to listen. Nobody can be compelled to listen   and   nobody   can   claim   that   he   has   a   right   to make   his   voice   trespass   into   the   ears   or   mind   of others.   Nobody   can   indulge   into   aural   aggression.   If anyone   increases   his   volume   of   speech   and   that   too with   the   assistance   of   artificial   devices   so   as   to compulsorily expose unwilling persons to hear a noise raised   to   unpleasant   or   obnoxious   levels,   then   the person   speaking   is   violating   the   right   of   others   to   a peaceful,   comfortable   and   pollution­free   life guaranteed   by Article   21. Article   19(1)(a)   cannot   be pressed   into   service   for   defeating   the   fundamental right guaranteed by Article 21. …” (iv) In  Ram   Jethmalani  the   right   to   know,   inhering   in   Article 19(1)(a) and the right to privacy under Article 21, were seen to be   in   conflict.   Right   to   privacy   was   asserted   by   individuals holding   bank accounts  in other  countries. The  court had  to balance the same with the citizens’ right to know. This Court propounded as follows: “84.  The   rights   of   citizens,   to   effectively   seek   the protection   of   fundamental   rights,   under   clause   (1) of Article 32 have to be balanced against the rights of citizens   and   persons   under Article   21. The   latter cannot be sacrificed on the anvil of fervid desire to find instantaneous solutions to systemic problems such as unaccounted   for   monies,   for   it   would   lead   to 62 dangerous   circumstances,   in   which   vigilante investigations,   inquisitions   and   rabble   rousing,   by masses of other citizens could become the order of the day.   The   right   of   citizens   to   petition   this   Court   for upholding   of   fundamental   rights   is   granted   in   order that   citizens,   interalia,   are   ever   vigilant   about   the functioning   of   the   State   in   order   to   protect   the constitutional   project.   That  right   cannot   be   extended to being inquisitors of fellow citizens. An inquisitorial order, where citizens’ fundamental right to privacy is breached   by   fellow   citizens   is   destructive   of   social order.   The   notion   of   fundamental   rights,   such   as   a right to privacy as part of right to life, is not merely that the State is enjoined from derogating from them. It   also   includes   the   responsibility   of   the   State   to uphold   them   against   the   actions   of   others   in   the society, even in the context of exercise of fundamental rights by those others.” (v) In Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited  freedom of press and the right to fair trial were the competing rights. In this case, the Constitution Bench was dealing with a question whether   an   order   for   postponement   of   publication   of   the proceedings   pending   before   a   Court,   would   constitute   a restriction   under   Article   19(1)(a)   and   as   to   whether   such restriction   is   saved   under   Article   19(2).     This   question   was answered by the Constitution Bench in para 42 as follows: “42. At the outset, we must understand the nature of such orders of postponement. Publicity postponement orders should be seen in the context of Article 19(1)(a) not being an absolute right. The US clash model based on collision between freedom of expression (including free press) and the right to a fair trial will not apply to the   Indian   Constitution.   In   certain   cases,   even   the accused seeks publicity (not in the pejorative sense) as openness and transparency is the basis of a fair trial in   which   all   the   stakeholders   who   are   a   party   to   a 63 litigation including the Judges are under scrutiny and at the same time people get to know what is going on inside the courtrooms. These aspects come within the scope   of   Article   19(1)   and   Article   21.  When   rights   of equal   weight   clash,   the   Courts   have   to   evolve balancing   techniques   or   measures   based   on recalibration   under   which   both   the   rights   are   given equal  space in the constitutional  scheme and this is what   the   “postponement   order”   does,   subject   to   the parameters mentioned hereinafter. But, what happens when   the   courts   are   required   to   balance   important public   interests   placed   side   by   side.   For   example,   in cases   where   presumption   of   open   justice   has   to   be balanced   with   presumption   of   innocence,   which   as stated   above,   is   now   recognised   as   a   human   right. These   presumptions   existed   at   the   time   when   the Constitution   was   framed   [existing   law   under   Article 19(2)] and they continue till date not only as part of rule of law under Article 14 but also as an Article 21 right. The constitutional protection in Article 21 which protects the rights of the person for a fair trial is, in law,  a   valid  restriction  operating   on   the   right   to  free speech   under   Article   19(1)(a),   by   virtue   of   force   of   it being   a   constitutional   provision.   Given   that the postponement   orders curtail   the   freedom   of expression   of   third   parties,   such   orders   have   to   be passed   only   in   cases   in   which   there   is real   and substantial risk of prejudice to fairness of the trial or to the proper administration of justice which in the words of Justice Cardozo is “the end and purpose of all laws”. However,   such   orders   of   postponement   should   be ordered for a limited duration and without disturbing the content of the publication. They should be passed only   when   necessary   to   prevent   real   and   substantial risk to the fairness of the trial (court proceedings), if reasonable   alternative   methods   or   measures   such   as change   of   venue   or   postponement   of   trial   will   not prevent the said risk and when the salutary effects of such orders outweigh the deleterious effects to the free expression of those affected by the prior restraint. The order   of   postponement   will   only   be   appropriate   in cases where the balancing test otherwise favours non­ publication for a limited period. …” 64 (vi) In  Thalapplam Service Cooperative Bank Ltd.  (supra),  the right to know held as part of Article 19(1)(a) and the right to privacy being part of Article 21 were perceived as competing with each other, in a matter between holders of accounts in cooperative   banks   and   members   of   the   public   who   wanted details. This Court in paragraph 64 held: “64. Recognising the fact that the right to privacy is a sacrosanct facet of Article 21 of the Constitution, the legislation  has put a  lot  of safeguards  to protect  the rights under Section 8(j), as already indicated.   If the information   sought   for   is   personal   and   has   no relationship   with   any   public   activity   or   interest   or   it will   not   subserve   larger   public   interest,   the   public authority or the officer concerned is not legally obliged to provide those information.  Reference may be made to   a   recent   judgment   of   this   Court   in   Girish Ramchandra   Deshpande   v.     Central   Information Commr.,  (2013) 1 SCC 212, wherein this Court held that   since   there   is   no   bona   fide   public   interest   in seeking information, the disclosure of said information would   cause   unwarranted   invasion   of   privacy   of   the individual under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act.   Further, if the authority finds that information sought for can be made available in the larger public interest, then the officer   should   record   his   reasons   in   writing   before providing   the   information,   because   the   person   from whom   information   is   sought   for,   has   also   a   right   to privacy   guaranteed   under   Article   21   of   the Constitution.” (vii)  In  Subramanian   Swamy  (supra),  the   right   to   freedom   of speech of an individual guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a)  qua the   right   to   dignity   and   reputation   of   another   individual guaranteed under Article 21 were the competing rights. In this case, the Court held as follows:  65 “98. Freedom   of   speech   and  expression  in  a   spirited democracy   is   a   highly   treasured   value.   Authors, philosophers   and   thinkers   have   considered   it   as   a prized   asset   to   the   individuality   and   overall progression   of   a   thinking   society,   as   it   permits argument, allows dissent to have a respectable place, and honours contrary stances. There are proponents who have set it on a higher pedestal than life and not hesitated to barter death for it. Some have condemned compelled   silence   to   ruthless   treatment.   William Dougles has denounced regulation of free speech like regulating   diseased   cattle   and   impure   butter.   The Court   has   in   many   an   authority   having   realised   its precious nature and seemly glorified sanctity has put it   in   a   meticulously   structured   pyramid.   Freedom   of speech is treated as the thought of the freest who has not mortgaged his ideas, may be wild, to the artificially cultivated   social   norms;   and   transgression   thereof   is not   perceived   as   a   folly.   Needless   to   emphasise, freedom of speech has to be allowed specious castle, but   the   question   is:   should   it   be   so   specious   or regarded   as   so   righteous   that   it   would   make reputation   of   another   individual   or   a   group   or   a collection   of   persons   absolutely   ephemeral,   so   as   to hold   that   criminal   prosecution   on   account   of defamation   negates   and   violates   right   to   free   speech and expression of opinion…” (viii)  In Asha Ranjan (supra), the right to free trial, of an accused vis­à­vis  the   victim,   came   up   for   consideration.   The   Court propounded in paragraph 61: “61. Be it stated, circumstances may emerge that may necessitate   for   balancing   between   intra­fundamental rights. It has been distinctly understood that the test that   has   to   be   applied   while   balancing   the   two fundamental   rights   or   inter   fundamental   rights,   the principles applied may be different than the principle to   be   applied   in   intra­conflict   between   the   same fundamental right.  To  elaborate,  as in  this  case,  the accused has  a  fundamental right  to have  a  fair  trial under   Article   21   of   the   Constitution.   Similarly,   the 66 victims who are directly affected and also form a part of the constituent of the collective, have a fundamental right for a fair trial. Thus, there can be two individuals both having legitimacy to claim or assert the right. The factum of legitimacy is a primary consideration. It has to   be   remembered   that   no   fundamental   right   is absolute   and   it   can   have   limitations   in   certain circumstances.   Thus,   permissible   limitations   are imposed  by   the  State.  The  said  limitations  are  to  be within   the   bounds   of   law.   However,   when   there   is intra­conflict   of   the   right   conferred   under   the   same article,   like   fair   trial   in   this   case,   the   test   that   is required   to   be   applied,   we   are   disposed   to   think,   it would   be   “paramount   collective   interest”   or “sustenance   of   public   confidence   in   the   justice dispensation   system”.   An   example   can   be   cited.   A group of persons in the name of “class honour”, as has been   stated   in Vikas   Yadav v. State   of   U.P., (2016)   9 SCC   541:  (2016)   3  SCC   (Cri)  621],  cannot   curtail  or throttle the choice of a woman. It is because choice of woman in choosing her partner in life is a legitimate constitutional right. It is founded on individual choice that is recognised in the Constitution under Article 19, and  such  a   right   is   not   expected   to  succumb   to the concept   of   “class   honour”   or   “group   thinking”.   It   is because the sense of class honour has no legitimacy even if it is practised by the collective under some kind of a notion. Therefore, if the collective interest or the public   interest   that   serves   the   public   cause   and further   has   the   legitimacy   to   claim   or   assert   a fundamental right, then only it can put forth that their right should be protected. There can be no denial of the fact that the rights of the victims for a fair trial is an inseparable aspect of Article 21 of the Constitution and when they assert that right by themselves as well as the part of the collective, the conception of public interest   gets   galvanised.   The   accentuated   public interest   in   such   circumstances   has   to   be   given primacy,  for   it   furthers  and  promotes   “Rule  of   Law”. …” 67 (ix)  In  Railway   Board   representing   the   Union   of   India  vs. Niranjan Singh53,  a trade union worker was charged of the misconduct   of   addressing   meetings   within   the   railway premises,   in   contravention   of   the   directions   issued   by   the employer.   When   he   sought   protection   under   clauses   (a),   (b) and (c) of Article 19(1), this Court rejected the same by holding “that the exercise of those freedoms will come to an end as soon as the right of someone else to hold his property intervenes.” This Court went on to state that “the validity of that limitation is not to be judged by the test prescribed in sub­Articles (2) and (3) of Article 19”. (x) In Life Insurance Corporation of India vs. Prof. Manubhai D. Shah54,  two fundamental rights were not competing or in conflict with each other. But the right to free speech and the right   to   propagate   one’s   ideas,   in   the   context   of   censorship under the Cinematograph Act, 1952 and in the context of a State institution refusing to publish an Article in an in­house magazine were in question. In Paragraph 23 of the Report, this Court said: “every right has a corresponding duty or obligation and so is the fundamental right of speech and expression.  The freedom conferred by Article 19(1((a) is therefore not absolute as perhaps in the case of the US First Amendment: it carries with it certain   responsibilities   towards   fellow   citizens   and   society   at 53(1969) 1 SCC 502 54 (1992) 3 SCC 637 68 large.  A   citizen   who   exercises   this   right   must   remain conscious that his fellow citizen too has a similar right. Therefore, the right must be so exercised as not to come in direct conflict with the right of another citizen.” 44. The series of decisions discussed above shows that whenever two or more fundamental rights appeared either to be on a collision course or to be seeking preference over one another, this Court has dealt   with   the   same   by   applying   well­established   legal   tools. Therefore, we are of the view that under the guise of invoking other fundamental   rights,   additional   restrictions,   over   and   above   those prescribed in Article 19(2), cannot be imposed upon the exercise of one’s fundamental rights. 45. In fine, we answer Question No.1 in the following manner:  “The   grounds   lined   up  in  Article  19(2)  for  restricting   the right   to   free   speech   are   exhaustive.   Under   the   guise   of invoking   other   fundamental   rights   or   under   the   guise   of two fundamental rights staking a competing claim against each   other,   additional   restrictions   not   found   in   Article 19(2),   cannot   be   imposed   on   the   exercise   of   the   right conferred by Article 19(1)(a) upon any individual.” 69 Question No.2 46. The   second   question   referred   to   us   is   as   to   whether   a fundamental right under Article 19 or 21 can be claimed against anyone other than the State or its instrumentalities. Actually, the question is not about “claim” but about “enforceability”. 47. To use the phraseology adopted by the philosophers of Law, the   question   on   hand   is   as   to   whether   Part   III   of   the Constitution has a “vertical” or “horizontal” effect.  Wherever Constitutional rights regulate and impact only the conduct of the Government and Governmental actors, in their dealings with private individuals, they are said to have “a vertical effect”. But wherever Constitutional   rights   impact   even   the   relations   between   private individuals, they are said to have “a horizontal effect”. 48. In   his   scholarly   article,   “The   ‘Horizontal   Effect’   of Constitutional Rights”, published in Michigan Law Review (Volume 2.   Issue   3,   2003)   Stephen   Gardbaum,   states   that   the   horizontal position has been adopted to varying degrees in Ireland, Canada, Germany,   South   Africa   and   European   Union.   According   to   the 70 learned   author,   this   issue   has   also   been   the   topic   of   sustained debate   in   the   United   Kingdom   following   the   enactment   of   the Human Rights Act of 199855. 49. No jurisdiction in the world appears to be adopting, at least as on date, a purely vertical approach or a wholly horizontal approach. A   vertical   approach   provides   weightage   to   individual   autonomy, choice and privacy, while the horizontal approach seeks to imbibe Constitutional   values   in   all   individuals.   These   approaches   which appear   to   be   bipolar   opposites,   raise   the   age­old   question   of ‘individual vs. society’. 50. Even in countries where the individual reigns supreme, as in the United States, the Thirteenth Amendment making slavery and involuntary   servitude   a   punishable   offence,   has   actually   made inroads into individual autonomy. Therefore, some scholars think that  the Thirteenth Amendment provided a shift from  the  ‘purely vertical’ approach in a direct way. Subsequently, an indirect effect of   the   horizontality   was   found   in   certain   decisions   of   the   U.S. Supreme Court, two of which are of interest. 55Interestingly The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 was enacted in India five years  before a similar Act came in United Kingdom. 71 51. After the American Civil War (1861­1865), the Reconstruction Era began in the United States. During this period, the Fourteenth Amendment   came   (1866­1868)   followed   by   the   Civil   Rights   Act, 1875 (also called Enforcement Act or Force Act). This Civil Rights Act,   1875   entitled   everyone,   to   access   accommodation,   public transport   and   theaters   regardless   of   race   or   color.   Finding   that despite the Act, they were excluded from “whites only” facilities in hotels,   theaters   etc.,   the   victims   of   discrimination   (African­ Americans) filed cases. All those five cases were tagged together and the U.S. Supreme Court held in (year 1883) what came to be known as  “Civil   Rights   Cases”56  that   the   Thirteenth   and   Fourteenth Amendments   did   not   empower   Congress   to   outlaw   racial discrimination by private individuals. But after nearly 85 years, this decision   was   overturned   in  Jones  vs.  Alfred   H.   Mayer   Co57 wherein   it   was   held   that   Congress   could   regulate   sale   of   private property to prevent racial discrimination. This was done in terms of 42 U.S. Code § 1982 which entitled all citizens of the United States to have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by 56109 US 3 (1883) 57392  US  409 (1968) 72 white   citizens   thereof   to   inherit,   purchase,   lease,   sell,   hold,   and convey real and personal property. 52. But a good 20 years before the decision in Jones (supra) was delivered, the U.S. Supreme Court had an occasion to consider a clash between contractual rights and Constitutional rights. It was in  Shelly  (supra) where an African­American family (Shellys) who purchased a property in a neighbourhood in St. Louis, Missouri was sought   to   be   restrained   from   taking   possession,   because   of   a racially restrictive covenant contained in an Agreement of the year 1911 to which a majority of property owners in the neighbourhood were   parties.   The   covenant   restricted   the   sale   of   any   property   or part thereof for a term of 50 years to African­Americans and Asian­ Americans.   The   Missouri   Supreme   Court   upheld   the   racially restricted covenant. But the U.S. Supreme Court reversed it holding that   the   enforcement   of   such   covenants   violated   the   Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.   In other words the   contractual   rights   were   trumped   by   the   Constitutional obligations. 73 53. Then came the decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan58. It was a case where the City Commissioner in Montgomery, Alabama filed an action for libel against the New York Times for publishing an allegedly defamatory statement in a paid advertisement. The jury awarded damages and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Alabama. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision   and   held   that   the   First   Amendment   which   prohibited   a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to the public official’s official conduct except in the case of actual malice, bound the plaintiff from exercising his private right. 54. The above decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court were seen by scholars as indicating a shift from a ‘purely vertical approach’ to a ‘horizontal approach’. 55. While   the   U.S.   Constitution   represented   (to   begin   with)   a purely vertical approach, the Irish Constitution was found to be on the opposite side of the spectrum, with the rights provided therein having horizontal effect. Article 40 of the Irish Constitution deals with Personal Rights under the Chapter “Fundamental Rights”. Sub­ 58376 U.S. 254 (1964) 74 Article (3) of Article 40 states that “The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable,  by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen”. In other words, two rights are guaranteed namely  (i)  respect for the personal rights of the citizen; and (ii) to defend and vindicate the personal rights of its citizen. 56. The second clause of sub­Article (3) of Article 40 of the Irish Constitution states that “The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen”. 57. The   above   provisions   have   been   interpreted   by   the   Irish Supreme Court as imposing a positive obligation on all State actors, including the Courts to protect and enforce the rights of individuals. It appears that full horizontal effect was given by the Irish Supreme Court   to   Constitutional   rights   such   as   freedom   of   association, freedom from sex discrimination and the right to earn a livelihood. For instance, the Irish Supreme Court had an occasion to consider 75 in  John   Meskell,  the   Constitutional   rights   of   citizens   to   form associations   and   unions   guaranteed   by   Article   40.6.1.   This   case arose  out   of   an   agreement   reached   between   certain  trade  unions and the employer  to terminate the services of  all workers and to reemploy them on condition that they agree to be members of the specified trade  unions  at  all  times.  One  employee  whose  services were terminated was not reemployed, as he refused to accept the special condition.  Therefore, he sued the company for damages and claimed   a   declaration   that   his   dismissal   was   a   violation   of   the Constitutional   rights.   Holding   that  the   Constitutional   right   of citizens   to   form   associations   and   unions   necessarily recognized   a   correlative   right   to   abstain   from   joining associations   and   unions,   the   Irish   Supreme   Court   awarded damages on the ground that the non­State actors actually violated the   Constitutional   right   of   the   plaintiff.   In   other   words,   the Constitutional rights were considered to have horizontal effect. 58. The  Constitution   of   the   Republic  of   South   Africa,   1996  also provides horizontal effect to certain rights.   Section 8.2 of the said Constitution  states: “A  provision  of  the  Bill   of  Rights   binds   a 76 natural   or   a   juristic   person  if,   and   to   the   extent   that,   it   is applicable, taking into account the nature of the right and the nature of any duty imposed by the right.” 59. The manner in which Section 8.2 has to be applied is spelt out in Section 8.3.  The same reads thus: “8.  Application ….. 3. When applying a provision of the Bill of Rights to a natural or juristic person in terms of subsection (2), a court  a.  in   order   to  give   effect   to  a   right   in   the  Bill, must apply, or if necessary develop, the common law  to  the  extent   that  legislation  does  not  give effect to that right; and b. may develop rules of the common law to limit the   right,   provided   that   the   limitation   is   in accordance with section 36(1).” 60. Section 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa guarantees equality before law and equal protection and the benefit of the law to everyone.  Section 9.3 mandates the State not to unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone, on one or more grounds including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, 77 marital   status,   ethnic   or   social   origin,   colour,   sexual orientation,   age,   disability,   religion,   conscience,   belief, culture, language, and birth.  If Section 9.3 is a mandate against the State, what follows in Section 9.4 is a mandate against every person.  Section 9.4 reads as follows: “9. Equality ….. 4. No person may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds in   terms   of   sub­section   (3).   National   legislation must   be   enacted   to   prevent   or   prohibit   unfair discrimination.” 61. Again,   Section   10   recognises   the   right   to   human   dignity. While doing so, it employs a language, which applies to non­ State actors also.   Section 10 states that “Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected”. 62. During the period from April 1994 to February 1997, when the Republic   of   South   Africa   had   an   Interim   Constitution,   the Constitutional Court of South Africa had an occasion to deal with a defamation   action   in  Du   Plessis   and   Others  vs.   De   Klerk   and 78 Another59.  The   defamation   action   was   instituted   by   an   Airline company, against a newspaper for publishing an article implicating the Airline in the unlawful supply of arms to UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). After the Interim Constitution came   into   force,   the   defendant­newspaper   raised   a   defence   that they were insulated against the defamation action, under Section 15  of  the   Constitution  which  protected  the  freedom  of  the   press. The Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court referred two issues   to   the   Constitutional   Court.  One   of   the   issues   was whether   Chapter   3   (fundamental   rights)   of   the   Constitution was applicable to legal relationships between private parties. The majority (11:2) of the Court held that Chapter 3 could not be applied   directly   to   the   common   law   in   actions   between   private parties.   But   they   left   open   the   question   whether   there   were particular   provisions   of   the   Chapter   that   could   be   so   applied. However,   the   Court   held   that   in   terms   of   Section   35(3)   of   the Interim   Constitution,   Courts   were   obliged   in   the   application   and development   of   common   law,   to   have   due   regard   to   the   spirit, purport and objects of Chapter 3. The majority held that it was the 59 1996 ZACC 10 79 task of the Supreme Court to apply and develop the common law as required by Section 35(3). 63.    Interestingly,   the   dissenting   opinion   given   by   Kriegler,   J. became the subject matter of lot of academic debate. To begin with, Kriegler, J. rejected the idea that the debate was one of “verticality versus horizontality”.  He said that Chapter 3 rights do not operate only   as   against   the   State   but   also   horizontally   as   between individuals   where   Statutes   are   involved.   Calling   “direct horizontality” as a bogeyman, Kriegler, J. said as follows: “The   Chapter   has   nothing   to   do   with   the   ordinary relationships between private persons or associations.  What it does govern, however, is all law, including that applicable   to   private   relationships.   Unless   and   until there is a resort to law, private individuals are at liberty to conduct their private affairs exactly as they please as far   as   the   fundamental   rights   and   freedoms   are concerned. As   far   as   the   Chapter   is   concerned   a landlord is free to refuse to let a flat to someone because of race, gender or whatever; a white bigot may refuse to sell property to a person of colour; a   social   club   may   black­ball   Jews,   Catholics   or Afrikaners   if   it   so   wishes. An   employer   is   at liberty   to   discriminate   on   racial   grounds   in   the engagement of staff; a hotelier may refuse to let a room   to   a   homosexual;   a   church   may   close   its doors to mourners of a particular colour or class.  But none of them can invoke the law to enforce or protect their bigotry.  One cannot claim rescission of   a   contract   or   specific   performance   thereof   if such   claim,   albeit   well­founded   at   common   law, 80 infringes   a   Chapter   3   right.   One   cannot   raise   a defence to a claim in law if such defence is in conflict with a protected right or freedom.  The whole gamut of private relationships is left undisturbed.  But the state, as the maker of the laws, the administrator of laws and the interpreter and applier of the law, is bound to stay within the four corners of Chapter 3.  Thus, if a man claims to have the right to beat his wife, sell his daughter  into  bondage  or  abuse  his  son,  he  will not   be   allowed   to   raise   as   a   defence   to   a   civil claim or a criminal charge that he is entitled to do so at common law, under customary law or in terms of any statute or contract.  That is a far cry from the spectre of the state placing its hand on private relationships. On the contrary, if it were to try to do so by legislation or administrative action, sections 4, 7(1) and the whole of Chapter 3 would stand as a bastion of personal rights.” 64. After the Final Constitution was adopted and it came into force on February 4, 1997, the first case to come up on this issue was Khumalo vs. Holomisa60.  In this case, Bantu Holomisa, the leader of the South African opposition political party sued a newspaper for publishing   an   article   alleging   as   though   he   was   under   a   police investigation   for   his   involvement   with   a   gang   of   bank   robbers. Heavy reliance was placed in this case on the majority decision of the Constitutional Court of South Africa in Du Plessis (supra). But as pointed out earlier, Du Plessis was a case which was decided at a   time   when   South   Africa   had   only   an   Interim   Constitution. 60 (2002) ZACC 12 81 Therefore, while dealing with  Khumalo  (supra), the Constitutional Court of South Africa applied the Final Constitution, as it had come into force by then. What is relevant for our purpose is the opinion of the   Constitutional   Court   in   paragraph   33   which   dealt   with   the enforcement of the rights against non­State actors. Paragraph 33 reads thus: “[33]   In   this   case,   the   applicants   are   members   of   the media   who   are   expressly   identified   as   bearers   of constitutional   rights   to   freedom   of   expression.     There can be no doubt that the law of defamation does affect the right to freedom of expression.  Given the intensity of   the   constitutional   right   in   question,   coupled with   the   potential   invasion   of   that   right   which could   be   occasioned   by   persons   other   than   the state or organs of state, it is clear that the right to   freedom   of   expression   is   of   direct   horizontal application   in   this   case   as   contemplated   by section 8(2) of the Constitution.   The first question we need then to determine is whether the common law of defamation unjustifiably limits that right.  If it does, it will   be   necessary   to   develop   the   common   law   in   the manner   contemplated   by   section   8(3)   of   the Constitution.” 65.    The   horizontal   effect   was   taken   to   another   extreme   by   the Constitutional   Court   of   South   Africa   in  Governing   Body   of   the Juma   Musjid   Primary   School   &   Others  vs.  Essay   N.O.   and Others61 wherein it was held that an eviction order obtained by the 61(CCT 29/10) [2011] ZACC 13; 2011 (8) BCLR 761 (CC) 82 owner of a private land on which a public school was located, could not   be   enforced   as   it   would   impact   the   students’   right   to   basic education   and   the   best   interests   of   the   child   under   the   South African Constitution (Sections 28 and 29). The Court held that a private   landowner   and   non­State   actor   has   a   Constitutional obligation not to impair the right to basic education under Section 29 of the Constitution.  The relevant portion reads thus: “[57] In order to determine whether the right to a basic education in terms of section 29(1)(a) binds the Trust, section 8(2) requires that the nature of the right of the learners to a basic education and the duty imposed by that right be taken into account.  From the discussion in the previous paragraphs of the general nature of the right   and   the   MEC’s   obligation   in   relation   to   it,   the form   of   the   duty   that   the   right   to  a   basic   education imposed   on   the   Trustees   emerges.     It   is   clear   that there is no primary positive obligation on the Trust to provide basic education to the learners.  That primary positive obligation rests on the MEC.   There was also no   obligation   on   the   Trust   to   make   its   property available   to   the   MEC   for   use   as   a   public   school.     A private landowner may do so, however, in accordance with   section   14(1)   of   the   Act   which   provides   that   a public school may be provided on private property only in  terms  of an agreement  between the MEC   and  the owner of the property. [58]   This   Court,   in   Ex   Parte   Chairperson   of   the Constitutional Assembly: In re Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, made it clear that socio­economic rights (like the right to a   basic   education)   may   be   negatively   protected from  improper  invasion.  Breach  of  this  obligation occurs  directly   when   there   is  a   failure   to  respect the right, or indirectly, when there is a failure to 83 prevent   the   direct   infringement   of   the   right   by another   or   a   failure   to   respect   the   existing protection   of   the   right   by   taking   measures   that diminish   that   protection.   It   needs   to   be   stressed however   that   the   purpose   of   section   8(2)   of   the Constitution   is   not   to   obstruct   private   autonomy or to impose on a private party the duties of the state in protecting the Bill of Rights.   It is rather to require private parties not to interfere with or diminish the enjoyment of a right.  Its application also depends on the intensity of the constitutional right   in   question,   coupled   with   the   potential invasion of that right which could be occasioned by persons other than the State or organs of State.   ” 66. Coming   to   the   United   Kingdom,   they   ratified   the   European Convention on Human Rights in 1951.  But the rights conferred by the Convention had to be enforced by British citizens only in the European Court of Human Rights, for a long time. Finding that it took an average of five years to get an action in the European Court of Human Rights after all domestic remedies are exhausted and also finding that on an average, the same costed £30,000, a white paper was submitted in 1997 under the title “Rights Brought Home”.  This led   to   the   enactment   of   the   Human   Rights   Act,   1998   by   the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It came into force on 2.10.2000 (coincidentally Gandhi Jayanti Day).  This Act sought to incorporate into   the   domestic   law,   the   rights   conferred   by   the   European 84 Convention, so that the citizens need not go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  After the enactment of the Human Rights Act, the horizontal effect of Convention Rights became the subject matter of debate in several cases. 67. For instance, Douglas vs. Hello! Ltd.62 was a case where the right to privacy of an individual was pitted against the right of free speech   and   expression.   In   that   case,   a   magazine   called  OK!   was given the exclusive right to publish the photographs of the wedding reception of a celebrity couple that took place at New York. On the day of the wedding, certain paparazzo had infiltrated the venue and took   few   unauthorized   photographs   which   were   shared   with potential   competitor   viz.   Hello!   Ltd.   (another   magazine).   Hello! published the photographs in the next issue of their magazine even before Ok! could publish it. The question before the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) was whether there was violation of right to privacy, among   others  and   whether   it  could  be enforced  against  a  private person. The Court said: “49.  It   follows   that   the   ECtHR   has   recognised   an obligation   on   member   states   to   protect   one 62[2001] QB 967 85 individual   from   an   unjustified   invasion   of   private life  by another individual  and an obligation on the courts of a member state to interpret legislation in a way which will achieve that result.  50. Some, such as the late Professor Sir William Wade, in Wade & Forsyth Administrative Law (8 th Ed.) p 983, and   Jonathan   Morgan,   in Privacy,   Confidence   and Horizontal   Effect:\"   Hello\"   Trouble (2003)   CLJ   443, contend that the Human Rights Act should be given 'full, direct, horizontal effect'. The courts have not been prepared to go this far.… … 102.  To   summarise   our   conclusion   at   this   stage: disregarding the effect of the OK! contract, we are satisfied that the Douglases' claim for invasion of their   privacy   falls   to   be   determined   according   to the   English   law   of   confidence.   That   law,   as extended   to   cover   private   and   personal information,   protected   information   about   the Douglases' wedding.” 68. In  X vs. Y 63, the Court of Appeals dealt with the case of an employee X, who was cautioned by the Police for committing a sex offence   with   another   man   in   a   public   bathroom.   The   offence occurred when X was off duty. On finding about the incident, the employer   Y   suspended   X   and   dismissed   him   after   a   disciplinary hearing.   The   dismissal   was   challenged   as   violative   of   Convention Rights.   An   argument   was   raised   that   these   rights   are   not enforceable against private parties. Though on facts, the claim of 63[2004] EWCA Civ 662 86 the   dismissed   employee   was   dismissed,   the   legal   issue   was articulated by the Court thus: “55.   The   applicant   invoked   articles   8   and   14   of   the Convention in relation to his cause of action in private law. (1) As appears from the authorities cited in section C above, article 8 is not confined in its effect to relations between   individuals   and   the   state   and   public authorities.   It   has   been   interpreted   by   the Strasbourg court as imposing a positive obligation on   the   state   to   secure   the   observance   and enjoyment of the right between private individuals. (2)   If   the   facts   of   the   case   fall   within   the   ambit   of article 8, the state is also under a positive obligation under   article   14   to   secure   to   private   individuals   the enjoyment   of   the   right   without   discrimination, including   discrimination   on   the   ground   of   sexual orientation. (3)   A   person's   sexual  orientation   and   private   sex   life fall within the scope of the Convention right to respect for private life (see ADT v. UK [2000] 2 FLR 697) and the  right   to  non­discrimination   in  respect   that   right. Interference with the right within article 8.1 has to be justified under article 8.2.” 69. In Plattform \"Ärzte Für Das Leben\" vs. Austria 64, a question arose as to the enforceability of the right to freedom of assembly against non­State actors, who obstructed the assembly. The case arose   out   of   these   facts.  On   28   December   1980,   the anti­ abortion NGO \"Ärzte für das Leben\" (Physicians for Life) organised a religious service and a march to the clinic of a doctor who carried 64[1988] ECHR 15 87 out abortions in Stadl­Paura. A number of counter­demonstrators disrupted the march to the hillside by mingling with the marchers and   shouting   down   their   recitation.   At   the   end   of   the   ceremony, special riot­control units – which had until then been standing by – formed a cordon between the opposing groups. One person caught in   the   act   of   throwing   eggs   was   fined.   The   association   lodged   a disciplinary   complaint   against   police   for   failing   to   protect   the demonstration, which was refused. When the matter was taken to the Constitutional Court, it held that it had no jurisdiction over the case.   Therefore,   the   association   applied   to   the   European Commission   on   13   September   1982,   alleging   violation   of Articles 9 (conscience and religion), 10 (expression), 11 (association) and 13 (effective   remedy)   of   the European   Convention   on   Human Rights. The European Court on Human Rights held: “32.  A   demonstration   may   annoy   or   give   offence   to persons   opposed to   the   ideas   or   claims   that   it   is seeking   to   promote. The participants   must,   however, be   able   to   hold   the   demonstration   without having   to fear   that   they   will   be   subjected   to   physical   violence by their   opponents;   such   a   fear   would   be   liable   to deter associations or other groups supporting common ideas   or   interests   from   openly expressing   their opinions   on   highly   controversial   issues   affecting the community. In  a  democracy   the  right  to  counter­ demonstrate cannot extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right to demonstrate. 88 Genuine,   effective   freedom   of   peaceful   assembly cannot,   therefore,   be reduced   to   a   mere   duty   on the   part   of   the   State   not   to   interfere:   a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the object and purpose of Article 11 (art. 11). Like Article   8   (art.   8),   Article   11 (art.   11)   sometimes requires positive measures to be taken, even in the sphere of relations between individuals, if need be (see, mutatis mutandis, the X and Y v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, § 23)” 70. In  X and Y  vs.  The Netherlands65,  a privately­run home for children with mental disabilities was sued on the ground that a 16­ year­old   inmate   was   subjected   to   sexual   assault.   When   the   case was dismissed by the domestic court on a technical plea, the father of   the   victim   approached   the   European   Court   of   Human   Rights. ECHR outlined the extent of State obligation on the protection of the right to life even against private persons as follows: “23.   The   Court   recalls   that   although   the   object   of Article   8   (art.   8)   is   essentially   that   of   protecting   the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities,   it   does   not   merely   compel   the   State   to abstain   from   such   interference:   in   addition   to   this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private or   family   life   (see   the   Airey   judgment   of   9   October 1979,   Series   A   no.   32,   p.   17,   para.   32).  These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves.” 65[1985] ECHR 4 89 71. Having   taken   an   overview   of   the   theoretical   aspect   of “verticality   vs   horizontality”   and   the   approach   of   Constitutional Courts in other jurisdictions, let us now come back to the Indian context.  72. Part­III of the Indian Constitution begins with Article 12 which defines the expression “the State” to include the Government and the Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each   of   the   States   and   all   local   or   other   authorities   within   the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. 73. After defining the expression “the State” in Article 12 and after declaring   all   laws   inconsistent   with   or   in   derogation   of   the fundamental   rights   to   be   void   under   Article   13,   Part­III   of   the Constitution proceeds to deal with rights. There are some Articles in   Part­III   where   the   mandate   is   directly   to   the   State   and there   are   other  Articles   where   without   injuncting   the   State, certain   rights   are   recognized   to   be   inherent,   either   in   the citizens of the country or in persons. In fact, there are two sets of dichotomies that are apparent in the Articles contained in Part 90 III. One set of dichotomy is between (i) what is directed against the State;   and  (ii)  what   is   spelt   out   as   inhering   in   every   individual without   reference   to   the   State.   The   other   dichotomy   is   between (i)  citizens;   and  (ii)  persons.   This   can   be  illustrated   easily   in  the form of a table as follows: Sl. Nos. Provisions   containing   a mandate to the State Provisions   declaring the   rights   of   the individuals   without reference   to   “the State” on whom the right is conferred 1. Article 14 mandates the State not   to   deny   to   any   person equality   before   law   or   the equal   protection   of   the   laws within the territory of India. ­ Any person 2. Article   15(1)   mandates   the State   not   to   discriminate against   any   citizen   on grounds only of religion, race, caste,   sex,   place   of   birth   or any of them. ­ Any citizen 3. ­ Article 15(2) mandates that   no   citizen   shall be   subject   to   any disability,   liability, restriction   or condition, with regard to—   (i)   access   to shops,   public restaurants,   hotels and   places   of   public entertainment;   or   (ii) the   use   of   wells, tanks,   bathing   ghats, roads   and   places   of Citizen 91 public   resort maintained   wholly   or partly   out   of   State funds   or   dedicated   to the   use   of   general public, only   on   grounds   of religion,   race,   caste, sex,   place   of   birth   or any of them. 4. Article   16(1)   declares   that there   shall   be   equality   of opportunity for  all citizens in matters   relating   to employment   or   appointment to any office under the State. ­ Only citizens 5. Article   16(2)   states   that   no citizen   shall   on   grounds   of only religion, race, caste, sex, descent,   place   of   birth, resident   or   any   of   them   be ineligible for  or  discriminated against   in   respect   of   any employment   or   office   under the State. ­ Citizen 6. ­ Article   17   abolishes untouchability   and forbids the practice of the same in any form and declares it to be a punishable offence. Neither   the word   “citizen” nor   the   word “person”   is mentioned   in Article   17.   It means   that what   is abolished   is the   practice and   any violation   of this injunction   is punishable. 7. ­ Six types of rights are listed  in  Article   19(1), as   available   to   all Citizens 92 citizens. 8. Article   20   confers   three different rights namely (i) not to be convicted except by the application of a law in force at the time of the commission of offence;   (ii)   not   to   be prosecuted   and   punished   for the   same   offence   more   than once;   and   (iii)   right   against self­incrimination. ­ Persons 9. ­ Article 21 protects life and   liberty   of   all persons. Persons 10. Article   21A   mandates   the State   to   provide   free   and compulsory   education   to   all children   of   the   age   of   six   to fourteen years. ­ Children 11. Article 22 provides protection against   arrest   and   detention generally and saves preventive detention   with   certain limitations. ­ All   persons except   an enemy   alien (Article   22(3) (a)   makes   the provision inapplicable to   an   enemy alien). 12. ­ Article   23(1)   prohibits traffic   in   human beings and begar and other similar forms of forced   labour.     Any contravention is made a punishable offence. Any person 13. ­ Article   24   prohibits the   employment   of children below the age of   fourteen   years   in any factory or mine. Children 14. ­ Article   25(1)   declares the right of all persons to   freedom   of Persons 93 conscience   and   the right freely to profess, practice   and propagate religion. 15. ­ Article 26 confers four different   types   of rights   upon   every religious denomination   or   any section thereof. Religious  denomination 16. Article 27 confers right not to be   compelled   to   pay   any taxes,   for   the   promotion   of any particular religion. ­ Person 17. ­ Article   28(1)   forbids religious   instructions being provided in any educational institution   wholly maintained   out   of State   funds,   with   the exception   of   those established under any endowment or trust. Person 18. ­ A   right   not   to   take part   in   any   religious instruction   imparted in   an   educational institution   recognised by   the   State   or receiving   aid   out   of State   funds,   is conferred   by   Article 28(3). Person 19. ­ A right to conserve the language,   script   or culture distinct to any part of the territory of India   is   conferred   by Article 29(1). Citizens 20. A   right   not   to   be   denied admission   into   any This   applies   to institutions Citizen 94 educational   institution maintained   by   the   State   or receiving   aid   out   of   State funds,   on   grounds   only   of religion, race, caste, language or any of them is conferred by Article 29(2). maintained   by   the State   or   even   to institutions   receiving aid out of State funds. 21. (i)   A   right   to   establish   and administer   educational institutions   of   their   choice   is conferred   by   Article   30(1) upon the religious as well as linguistic minorities. (ii)     The   State   is   mandated under   Article   30(2)   not   to discriminate   against   any educational   institution   while granting aid. ­ Religious and  linguistic  minorities 22. ­ The right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement   of   the rights   conferred   by Part   III   is   guaranteed under Article 32. The   words “State”, “citizen”   or “person”   are not mentioned in   Article   32, indicating thereby   that the   right   is available   to one   and   all, depending upon   which right is sought to   be enforced. 74. The above table would show that some of the Articles of Part­ III are in the form of a directive to the State, while others are not. This is an indication that some of the rights conferred by Part­III are to be honored by and also enforceable against, non­State actors. 95 75. For instance, the rights conferred by Articles 15(2)(a) and (b), 17, 20(2), 21, 23, 24, 29(2) etc., are obviously enforceable against non­State actors also. The owner of a shop, public restaurant, hotel or  place of entertainment,  though  a  non­State actor  cannot  deny access to a citizen of India on grounds only of religion, race etc., in view  of   Article   15(2)(a).   So   is   the   case  with   wells,  tanks,   bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of general public, in view of Article 15(2)(b). The right not to be enforced with any disability arising out of untouchability is available against non­State actors under Article 17. The right against double jeopardy, and the right against self­incrimination available under sub­Articles (2) and (3) of Article 20 may also be available even against non­State actors in the   case   of   prosecution   on   private   complaints.   We   need   not elaborate   more,   as   the   table   given   above   places   all   rights   in perspective. 76. That takes us to the question as to how the Courts in India have dealt with cases where there were complaints of infringement by   non­State   actors,   of   fundamental   rights,   other   than   those 96 covered in column 2 of the Table in para 73 above. To begin with, this Court was weary of extending the enforcement of fundamental rights against private individuals. But this reluctance changed over a period of time. Let us now see how the law evolved: (i) In  P.D.   Shamdasani  (supra),   a   Five   Member   Bench   of   this Court was dealing with a writ petition under Article 32, filed by   a   person   who   lost   a   series   of   proceedings   both   civil   and otherwise,  against  the  Central  Bank   of  India  Limited,  which was   at   that   time   a   company   incorporated   under   Companies Act. The grievance of the petitioner in that case was that the shares held by him in the company were sold by the bank in exercise of its right of lien for recovery of a debt. Therefore, the petitioner pitched his claim under Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31(1)(which   was   available   at   that   time).  But   while  making  a comparison between Article 31(1) (as it stood at that time) and Article 21, both of which contained a declaration in the same negative   form,   this   Court   observed   in  P.D.   Shamdasani  as follows:   “There   is   no   express   reference   to   the   State   in Article 21. But could it be suggested on that account that that Article was intended to afford protection to life and personal liberty against violation by private individuals? The   words   “except   by   procedure   established   by   law” plainly exclude such a suggestion”. 97 (ii) The aforesaid principle in P.D. Shamdasani was reiterated by another   Five   Member   Bench   of   this   Court   in  Smt.   Vidya Varma  vs.  Dr.   Shiv   Narain   Varma66holding   that   the language of Article 31(1) and Article 21 are similar and that they do not apply to invasions of a right by a private individual and that consequently no writ will lie in such cases. (iii) In  Sukhdev   Singh  vs.  Bhagatram   Sardar   Singh Raghuvanshi67  two   questions   arose   before   a   Constitution Bench   of   this   Court.   One   of   the   questions   was   whether   an employee of a statutory corporation is entitled to protection of Articles 14 and 16 against the corporation on the premise that these   statutory   corporations   are   authorities   within   the meaning of Article 12. In his separate but concurring opinion, Mathew,   J.   pointed   out   that   the   concept   of   State   has undergone   drastic   changes   in   recent   years   and   that   today State cannot be conceived of simply as a coercive machinery wielding   the   thunderbolt   of   authority.   The   learned   Judge quoted  the  decision  of   the  US  Supreme  Court  in  Marsh  vs. Alabama68, where a person who was a Jehovah’s witness was arrested   for   trespassing   and   distributing   pamphlets,   in   a company town owned by a corporation. Though the property in question was private, the Court said that the operation of a town   was   a   public   function   and   that   therefore,   the   private 66AIR 1956 SC 108 67(1975) 1 SCC 421 68326 US 501 (1946) 98 rights   of   the   corporation   must   be   exercised   within constitutional limitations. After quoting the decision in Marsh, K.K. Mathew, J. went on to hold as follows: “95. But   how   far   can   this   expansion   go?   Except   in very few cases, our Constitution does not, through its own   force,   set   any   limitation   upon   private   action. Article 13(2) provides that no State shall make any law which takes away or abridges the rights guaranteed by Part III. It is the State action of a particular character that   is   prohibited.   Individual   invasion   of   individual right   is   not,   generally   speaking,   covered   by   Article 13(2).   In   other   words,   it   is   against   State   action   that fundamental   rights   are   guaranteed.   Wrongful individual acts unsupported by State authority in the shape   of   laws,   customs,   or   judicial   or   executive proceeding are not prohibited. Articles 17, 23 and 24 postulate that  fundamental rights  can  be  violated by private individuals and that the remedy under Article 32 may be available against them. But, by and large, unless an act is sanctioned in some way by the State, the action would not be State action. In other words, until   some   law   is   passed   or   some   action   is   taken through   officers   or   agents   of   the   State,   there   is   no action by the State…” (iv) In People’s Union for Democratic Rights  (supra) this Court pointed   out   that   the   fundamental   right   guaranteed   under Article   24   is   enforceable   against   everyone,   including   the contractors.  The Court went a step further by holding that the Union   of   India,   the   Delhi   Administration   and   the   Delhi Development   Authority   have   a   duty   to   ensure   that   this Constitutional obligation is obeyed by the contractors. Going further, this Court held that certain fundamental rights such as   those   found   in   Articles   17,   23   and   24   are   enforceable against the whole world. 99 (v) S. Rangarajan (supra) was a case where a division Bench of the Madras High Court revoked the ‘U’ certificate issued to a Tamil   feature   film,   on   the   ground   that   it   offended   the reservation policy. The Government of Tamil Nadu supported the   decision   of   the   High   Court   on   the   ground   that   several organizations   in   Tamil   Nadu   were   agitating   that   the   film should   be   banned   as   it   hurt   the   sentiments   of   people belonging to the reserved categories. After pointing out that this Court was amused and troubled by the stand taken by the State Government, this Court indicated that it is the duty of the State to protect the freedom of expression since it is a liberty granted against the State and that the State cannot plead its inability to handle the hostile audience problem.  Holding that the State cannot negate the rule of law and surrender to blackmail and intimidation, this Court said that it the obligatory duty of the Court to prevent it and protect the freedom. (vi) In  Smt.   Nilabati,  this   Court  made  a   distinction   between, (i) the decision in Kasturi Lal upholding the State’s plea of   sovereign   immunity   for   tortious   acts   of   its   servants, which was confined to the sphere of liability in tort; and (ii) the State’s liability for contravention of fundamental rights to which the doctrine of sovereign immunity has no application in the constitutional scheme. In paragraph 100 34,   which   contains   the   separate   but   concurring   opinion   of Dr. A.S. Anand, J., the law was summarised as follows:­ “34. The   public   law   proceedings   serve   a   different purpose than the private law proceedings. The relief of monetary   compensation,   as   exemplary   damages,   in proceedings under   Article 32 by  this Court  or  under Article   226   by   the   High   Courts,   for   established infringement   of   the   indefeasible   right   guaranteed under   Article   21   of   the   Constitution   is   a   remedy available   in   public   law   and   is   based   on   the   strict liability for contravention of the guaranteed basic and indefeasible rights of the citizen. The purpose of public law   is   not   only   to   civilize   public   power   but   also   to assure the citizen that they live under a legal system which aims to protect their interests and preserve their rights. Therefore, when the court moulds the relief by granting “compensation” in proceedings under Article 32 or 226 of the Constitution seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights, it does so under the public   law   by   way   of   penalising   the   wrongdoer   and fixing   the   liability   for   the   public   wrong   on   the   State which   has   failed   in   its   public   duty   to   protect   the fundamental   rights   of   the   citizen.   The   payment   of compensation in such cases is not to be understood, as   it   is   generally   understood   in   a   civil   action   for damages   under   the   private   law   but   in   the   broader sense   of   providing   relief   by   an   order   of   making ‘monetary amends’ under the public law for the wrong done  due  to breach  of  public  duty,  of  not  protecting the   fundamental   rights   of   the   citizen.   The compensation is in the nature of ‘exemplary damages’ awarded   against   the   wrongdoer   for   the   breach   of   its public   law   duty   and   is   independent   of   the   rights available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation under   the   private   law   in   an   action   based   on   tort, through   a   suit   instituted   in   a   court   of   competent jurisdiction   or/and   prosecute   the   offender   under   the penal law.” (vii) In  Lucknow   Development   Authority  vs.  M.K.   Gupta69  this Court pointed out that the administrative law of accountability 69(1994) 1 SCC 243 101 of   public   authorities   for   their   arbitrary   and   even  ultra   vires actions has taken many strides and that it is now accepted by both by this Court and English Courts that the State is liable to compensate for the loss or injury suffered by a citizen due to arbitrary actions of its employees. (viii) The   decision   in  Bodhisattwa   Gautam  (supra),   arose   under special   circumstances.   A   girl   student   of   a   college   lodged   a complaint   against   a   Lecturer   for   alleged   offences   under Sections   312,   420,   493,   496   and   498­A   IPC.     The   Lecturer moved the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing the complaint. The High Court dismissed the quash petition. When the Lecturer filed a special leave petition, this Court not only dismissed the SLP but also issued notice suo motu on the question as to why he should not be asked to pay reasonable monthly maintenance during the pendency of the prosecution. Finally,   this   Court   ordered   payment   of   a   monthly   interim compensation   after  holding   that   what   was   violated   was the fundamental right of the women under Article 21 and that   therefore   a   remedy   can   be   provided   by   this   Court under Article 32 even against the non­state actor (namely the   accused).     This   decision   was   cited   with   approval   in Chairman,   Railway   Board  &   Ors.  vs.  Chandrima   Das (Mrs.) &Ors.70. 70(2000) 2 SCC 465 102 (ix) As rightly highlighted by the learned  amicus,  this Court has awarded   damages   against   non­State   actors   under   the environmental law regime, whenever they were found to have violated the right under Article 21. For instance this Court was concerned   with   a   case   in  M.C.   Mehta  vs.  Kamal   Nath  71 where   a   company   built   a   club   on   the   banks   of   River   Beas, partly   taken   on   lease   from   the   Government   and   partly   by encroaching into forest land and virtually turning the course of   the   River.   Invoking   the   “polluter   pays   principle”   and “precautionary   principle”   landscaped   in  Vellore   Citizens’ Welfare   Forum  vs.  Union   of   India72and   also   applied   in Indian   Council   for   Enviro­Legal   Action  vs.  Union   of India73, this Court held the owner of the private motel to be liable to pay compensation towards the cost of restoration of the ecology of the area. Thereafter, a show cause notice was issued to the motel as to why they should not be asked to pay compensation to reverse the degraded environment and as to why a pollution fine should not be imposed. In response, the motel contended before this Court that though in proceedings under   Article   32   it   was   open   to   this   Court   to   grant compensation  to  the  victims whose fundamental  rights  were violated   or   who   are   victims   of   arbitrary   Executive   action   or victims of atrocious behavior of public authorities, the Court cannot impose any fine on those who are guilty of that action. 71(1997) 1 SCC 388 72(1996) 5 SCC 647 73(1996) 3 SCC 212 103 The motel also contended that fine is a component of criminal jurisprudence   and   hence   the   imposition   of   fine   would   be violative   of   Articles   20   and   21.   This   Court,   even   while accepting the said argument in so far as the component of fine is concerned, directed the issue of fresh notice to the motel to show   cause   why   exemplary   damages   be   not   awarded,   in addition   to   the   damages   already   awarded.   Thereafter,   this Court held in M.C. Mehta vs. Kamal Nath (supra at footnote no.15) as follows:­ “10. In   the   matter   of   enforcement   of   fundamental rights under Article 21, under public law domain, the Court, in exercise of its powers under Article 32 of the Constitution, has awarded damages against those who have   been   responsible   for   disturbing   the   ecological balance either by running the industries or any other activity which has the effect of causing pollution in the environment. The Court while awarding damages also enforces the “POLLUTER­PAYS  PRINCIPLE” which is widely accepted as a means of paying for the cost of pollution and control. To put in other words, the wrongdoer, the polluter,   is   under   an   obligation   to   make   good   the damage caused to the environment.” (x) In  Consumer   Education   &   Research   Centre  &   Ors.  vs. Union of India  &Ors.74, this Court held that in appropriate cases   the   Court   could   give   appropriate   directions   to   the employer,   be   it   the   State   or   its   undertaking   or  private employer,   to   make   the   right   to   life   meaningful,   to   prevent pollution of work place, protection of environment, protection of   the   health   of   the   workmen   and   to   preserve   free   and 74(1995) 3 SCC 42 104 unpolluted water for the safety and health of the people. The Court was dealing in that case with the occupational health hazards   and   diseases   afflicting   the   workmen   employed   in asbestos industries. In paragraph 29 of the Report, this Court said, “…It is therefore settled law that in public law claim for compensation is a remedy available under Article 32 or Article 226   for   the   enforcement   and   protection   of   fundamental   and human   rights.   …   It   is   a   practical   and   inexpensive   mode   of redress available for the contravention made by the State, its servants, its instrumentalities, a company or a person in the purported   exercise   of   their   powers   and   enforcement   of the   rights   claimed   either   under   the   statutes   or   licence issued   under   the  statute   or   for   the   enforcement   of   any right or duty under the Constitution or the law.” (xi) In  Vishaka  vs.  State of Rajasthan.75,  this Court laid down guidelines, in the absence of a legislation, for the enforcement of the right to gender equality of working women, in a class action petition that was filed to enforce fundamental rights of working women and to prevent sexual harassment of women in workplace. The guidelines imposed an obligation upon both public and private employers not to violate the fundamental rights   guaranteed   to   working   women   under   Article   14,   15, 19(1)(g) and 21. In Medha Kotwal Lele & Ors.  vs. Union of 75(1997) 6 SCC 241 105 India76,this   Court   noted   that   even   after   15   years   of   the judgment in Vishaka (supra), many States had not made the necessary amendments or  failed to effectively implement the guidelines. This Court issued a direction in Paragraph 44.4 : “44.4     The   State   functionaries   and   private   and public   sector   undertakings/organisations/bodies/ institutions,   etc.   shall   put   in   place   sufficient mechanism to ensure full implementation of Vishaka [Vishaka   v.   State   of   Rajasthan,   (1997)   6   SCC   241   : 1997   SCC   (Cri)   932]   guidelines   and   further   provide that   if   the   alleged   harasser   is   found   guilty,   the complainant  victim   is  not  forced  to work  with/under such harasser and where appropriate and possible the alleged   harasser   should   be   transferred.   Further provision   should   be   made   that   harassment   and intimidation of  witnesses and the complainants shall be met with severe disciplinary action.” (xii) In Githa Hariharan (Ms.) & Anr. vs. Reserve Bank of India & Anr.77,  this Court was dealing with a challenge to  Section 6(a) of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and Section   19(b)   of   the   Guardians   and   Wards   Act,   1890   which declared the father to be the natural guardian of the person and   property   of   a   minor   son   and   unmarried   daughter.   The mother was recognised as the natural guardian under these provisions   “after   the   father”.  These   provisions   resulted   in hardship to spouses separated from each other while dealing with   the   wards.   Reading   the   obligations   of   the   State   under certain International Conventions like CEDAW into the right to 76(2013) 1 SCC 297 77(1999) 2 SCC 228 106 dignity of women and gender equality, traceable to Article 21 and 14, this Court read down the word “after” to mean “in the absence   of”.   By   such   interpretation,   this   Court   invoked fundamental rights to interpret a word in the sphere of family law. (xiii) In  Indian   Medical   Association  vs.  Union   of   India.78,   the policy  of an Army College of Medical Sciences to admit only those   who   are   wards   of   army   personnel,   based   on   scores obtained   in   an   entrance   test,   was   under   challenge.   The question   that   came   up   for   consideration   was   whether   this discriminatory   practice   by   a   private   entity   would   be   in violation   of   Article   15   of   the   Constitution.   This   Court   in Paragraph 187 stated: “187.  Inasmuch as education, pursuant to T.M.A. Pai [(2002) 8 SCC 481], is an occupation under sub­clause (g) of clause (1) of Article 19, and it is a service that is offered for a fee that takes care of all the expenses of the   educational   institution   in   rendering   that   service, plus a reasonable surplus, and is offered to all those amongst   the   general   public,   who   are   otherwise qualified,   then   such   educational   institutions   would also be subject to the discipline of clause (2) of Article 15.   In   this   regard,  the   purport   of   the   above exposition of clause (2) of Article 15, when read in the context of egalitarian jurisprudence inherent in Articles 14,   15,  16  and  Article   38,  and   read  with our national aspirations of establishing a society in which   equality   of   status   and   opportunity,   and justice, social, economic and political, would imply that the private sector which offers such facilities ought   not   to   be   conducting   their   affairs   in   a manner   which   promote   existing   discriminations and disadvantages.” 78 (2011) 7 SCC 179 107 (xiv) In  Society   for   Unaided   Private   Schools   of   Rajasthan (supra),  the   constitutionality   of   Section   12   of   the   Right   of Children   to   Free   and   Compulsory   Education   Act,   2009   was challenged on the ground that it violated Articles 19(1)(g) and 30 of those who had established schools in the private sector. While upholding the Constitutionality of the provision, which required all schools, private and State­funded, to reserve 25% of its intake for students from disadvantaged background, this Court held:  “222. The   provisions   referred   to   above   and   other provisions   of   international   conventions   indicate   that the rights have been guaranteed to the children and those   rights   carry   corresponding   State   obligations   to respect, protect and fulfil the realisation of children's rights.     The   obligation   to   protect   implies   the horizontal right which casts an obligation on the State   to   see   that   it   is   not   violated   by   non­State actors. For non­State actors to respect children's rights   casts   a   negative   duty   of   non­violation   to protect   children's   rights   and   a   positive   duty   on them to prevent the violation of children's rights by others, and also to fulfil children's rights and take   measures   for   progressive   improvement.   In other words, in the spheres of non­State activity there shall be no violation of children's rights.” (xv) In  Jeeja   Ghosh  vs.  Union   of   India79,   the   petitioner,   a disabled   person   suffering   from   cerebral   palsy,   was unceremoniously ordered off a SpiceJet aircraft by the flight crew   on   account   of   the   disability.   The   petition   was   filed   for putting in place a system to ensure such a violation of human 79(2016) 7 SCC 761 108 dignity   and   inequality   is   not   meted   out   to   similarly   placed persons. This Court observed as follows:  “10. It is submitted by the petitioner that the Union of India (Respondent 1) has an obligation to ensure that its   citizens   are   not   subject   to   such   arbitrary   and humiliating   discrimination.   It   is   a   violation   of   their fundamental rights, including the right to life, right to equality, right to move freely throughout the territory of   India,   and   right   to   practise   their   profession.  The State   has   an   obligation   to   ensure   that   these rights are protected — particularly for those who are disabled. …” This Court awarded compensation to the petitioner against the private Airline on the ground that the airline, though a private enterprise, ought not to have violated her fundamental right. (xvi) In  Zee Telefilms Ltd.  vs.  Union of India80, this Court held that   though   BCCI   does   not   fall   within   the   purview   of   the   term “State”,   it   discharges   public   duties   and   that   therefore   even   if   a remedy under Article 32 is not available, the aggrieved party can always seek a remedy before the ordinary courts of law or by way of a writ petition under Article 226.   This Court pointed out that the violator   of   a   constitutional   right   could   not   go   scot­free   merely because it is not a State.  The said logic was extended by this Court to   a   “Deemed   to   be   University”   in  Janet   Jeyapaul  vs.  SRM 80(2005) 4 SCC 649 109 University81, on the ground that though it is a private university, it was discharging “public functions”, by imparting education. 77. All the above decisions show that on a case­to­case basis, this Court applied horizontal effect, considering the nature of the right violated and the extent of obligation on the part of the violator. But to enable the courts to have certain basic guidelines in place, for dealing with such cases, this Court developed a tool in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy. While affirming the right to privacy as a fundamental right, this Court laid down the landscape as follows: “397.  Once we have arrived at this understanding of the nature of fundamental rights, we can dismantle a core assumption of the Union's argument: that a right must   either   be   a   common   law   right   or   a fundamental   right.   The   only   material   distinctions between the two classes of right—of which the nature and content may be the same—lie in the incidence of the duty to respect the right and in the forum in which a   failure   to   do   so   can   be   redressed.  Common   law rights are horizontal in their operation when they are violated by one's fellow man, he can be named and   proceeded   against   in   an   ordinary   court   of law.   Constitutional   and   fundamental   rights,   on the   other   hand,   provide   remedy   against   the violation of a valued interest by the “State”, as an abstract   entity,   whether   through   legislation   or otherwise,   as   well   as   by   identifiable   public officials,   being   individuals   clothed   with   the powers of the State. It is perfectly possible for an 81(2015) 16 SCC 530 110 interest   to   simultaneously   be   recognised   as   a common   law   right   and   a   fundamental   right. Where the interference with a recognised interest is by the State or any other like entity recognised by   Article   12,   a   claim   for   the   violation   of   a fundamental right would lie. Where the author of an identical interference is a non­State actor, an action   at   common   law   would   lie   in   an   ordinary court. 398.  Privacy has the nature of being both a common law right as well as a fundamental right. Its content, in both forms, is identical. All that differs is the incidence of   burden   and   the   forum   for   enforcement   for   each form.” 78. Thus, the answer to Question No. 2 is partly found in the 9­ Judge Bench decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy itself. We have seen   from   the   line   of   judicial   pronouncements   listed   above   that after A.K. Gopalan vs. State of Madras82 lost its hold, this Court has   expanded   the   width   of   Article   21   in   several   areas   such   as health, environment, transportation, Education and Prisoner’s life etc. As Vivian Bose, J., put it in a poetic language in S. Krishnan vs   State   of   Madras83“Brush   aside   for   a   moment   the pettifogging   of   the   law   and   forget   for   the   nonce   all   the learned disputations about this and that, and \"and\" or \"or \", or   \"may\"   and   \"must   \".   Look   past   the   mere   verbiage   of   the 82AIR 1950 SC 27 83 AIR 1951 SC 301 111 words   and   penetrate   deep   into   the   heart   and   spirit   of   the Constitution.”. The original thinking of this Court that these rights can be enforced only  against the State, changed over a period of time.   The   transformation   was   from   “State”   to   “Authorities”   to “instrumentalities   of   State”   to   “agency   of   the   Government”   to “impregnation   with   Governmental   character”   to   “enjoyment   of monopoly   status   conferred   by   State”   to   “deep   and   pervasive control”84  to   the   “nature   of   the   duties/functions   performed”85. Therefore, we would answer Question No. 2 as follows:  “A fundamental right under Article 19/21 can be   enforced   even   against   persons   other   than the State or its instrumentalities” Question No. 3 79. “Whether the State is under a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India even against a threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another citizen or private agency?” is the third question referred to us. 84 R.D. Shetty vs International Airport Authority (1979) 3 SCC 489  85 Andi Mukta vs V.R. Rudani (1989) 2 SCC 691  112 80. Before   we   proceed   further,   it   is   necessary   to   make   a   small correction. Article 21 right is available not only to citizens but to all persons. Therefore, the word ‘citizen’ mentioned in Question No.3 has to be read as ‘person’.    81. As   we   have   pointed   out   in   the   Table   under   paragraph   73 above, the expression  “the  State” is not used in Article 21.   This Article 21 guarantees every person that he shall not be deprived of his life and liberty except according to the procedure established by law. Going by the scheme of Part­III which we have outlined both in the preceding paragraphs and in the Table in paragraph 73, it is clear that the State has two obligations, (i) not to deprive a person of his life and liberty except according to procedure established by law; and  (ii)  to ensure that the life and liberty of a person is not deprived even otherwise. Article 21 does not say “the State shall not deprive a person of his life and liberty”, but says that “no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty”. 82. When the Constitution was adopted, our understanding of the words “life” and “personal liberty” was not as it has evolved over the 113 past seven decades. Similarly, it was not imagined or conceived at that time that anyone other than the State is capable of depriving the  life  and personal  liberty  of  a person, except by  committing  a punishable   offence.   But   with   the   expanding   horizons   of   our philosophical   understanding   of   law,   life   and   liberty   and   the advancement   of   science   and   technology,   we   have   come   to   realize that “life is not an empty dream” and “our hearts are not muffled drums beating funeral marches to the grave”86, nor is “life a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing”87. 83. Over a period of time, this Court has interpreted ‘the right to life’ to include, (i) livelihood; (ii) all those aspects of life which go to make   a   man’s   life   meaningful,   complete   and   worth   living;  (iii) something more than mere survival or animal existence; (iv) right to live (and die) with human dignity;  (v)  right to food, water, decent environment,   medical   care   and   shelter   etc.;  (vi)  all   that   gives meaning to a man’s life, such as his tradition, culture, heritage and protection of that heritage in its full measure; and (vii) the right to Privacy. There are certain jurisdictions which have taken this right 86 From H.W. Longfellow in “A Psalm of life” 87 From Shakespeare in Macbeth 114 to   include   “the   right   to   be   forgotten”   or   the   “right   not   to   be remembered”. 84. When the word “life” was understood to mean only  physical existence, the deprivation of the same was generally conceived to be possible   only   by   the   State,   except   in   cases   where   someone committed   an   offence   punishable   under   the   Penal   Code.   But   the moment   the   right   to   life   under   Article   21   was   developed   into   a bouquet   of   rights   and   science   and   technology   intruded   into   all spheres to life, the deprivation of the right by non­State actors also became possible. Another development that has taken place in the past   3   to   4   decades   is   that   several   of   the   functions   of   the Government   have   either   been   out­sourced   to   non­State   actors   or been entrusted to public­private partnerships. This is why, the High Courts and this Court modulated the tests to be applied for finding out the maintainability of an action under Article 226 or Article 32. Once upon a time, the maintainability  of a petition under Article 32/226 depended upon “who the respondent was”. Later, the focus shifted   to   “the   nature   of   the   duties/functions   performed”   by   the 115 respondent, for finding out his amenability to the jurisdiction under Article 226. 85. Life and personal liberty are two different things, even while being   an   integral   part   of   a   whole   and   they   have   different connotations. Question No. 3 is so worded that the focus is not on ‘deprivation of life’ but on (i) ‘deprivation of personal liberty’ and that too by  the acts or omissions of another person or private agency; and (ii) the duty of the State to affirmatively protect it. Therefore, we shall,   in   our   discussion,   focus   more   on   two   aspects,   namely, (i)  deprivation of personal liberty by non­State actors; and  (ii)  the duty   of   the   State.   An   elaborate   exposition   of   the   expression “personal liberty” and its origin in Greek civilization may be found in the judgment of this Court in Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre vs. State of Maharashtra88. Suffice it to say for our purpose that in   this   judgment,   this   Court   identified   in   paragraph   53   of   the Report that Article 21 guarantees two rights, namely, (i) right to life; and  (ii)  right to personal liberty. Therefore, because of the manner in   which   Question   No.   3   is   framed,   we   shall   try   to   confine   our 88 (2011) 1 SCC 694 116 discussion to personal liberty, though at times both may overlap or get interchanged.   86. The expression “personal liberty” appearing in Article 21 was held by this Court in A.K. Gopalan  (supra) to mean freedom from physical   restraint   of   a   person   by   incarceration   or   otherwise. However, the understanding of the expression “personal liberty” got enlarged in Kharak Singh vs. State of U.P.89  It was a case where a person who was originally charged for the offence of dacoity and later released for lack of evidence, was put under surveillance by the Police, and his name included in the history­sheet under the U.P.   Police   Regulations.   As   a   result,   he   was   required   to   make frequent   visits   to   the   Police   Station.   Sometimes   the   Police   made domiciliary visits at night to his house. They would knock at the door, disturb his sleep and ask to report to the Police, whenever he went   out   of   the   village.   Though   by   a   majority,   the   Constitution Bench held in Kharak Singh (supra) that the regulation permitting domiciliary visits is unconstitutional, the majority upheld the Police surveillance on the ground that (at that time) right to privacy had 89AIR 1963 SC 1295 117 not become part of the fundamental rights.   But K. Subba Rao, J. speaking   for   himself   and   J.C.   Shah,   J.   held   that   the   concept   of personal liberty in Article 21 is comprehensive enough to include privacy.   The   thinking   reflected   in  A.K.   Gopalan  that   physical restraint   was   necessary   to   constitute   infringement   of   personal liberty, was completely changed by K. Subba Rao, J. in his minority opinion in  Kharak Singh. Giving a completely new dimension to personal liberty, K. Subba Rao, J. said: “(31)   …The   expression   is   wide   enough   to   take   in   a right   to   be   free   from   restrictions   placed   on   his movements. The expression “coercion” in the modern age   cannot   be   construed   in   a   narrow   sense.  In   an uncivilized society where there are no inhibitions, only   physical   restraints   may   detract   from personal liberty, but as civilization advances the psychological   restraints   are   more   effective   than physical   ones.   The   scientific   methods   used   to condition   a   man's   mind   are   in   a   real   sense physical   restraints,   for   they   engender   physical fear   channelling   one's   actions   through anticipated   and   expected   grooves.   So   also creation of conditions which necessarily engender inhibitions   and   fear   complexes   can   be   described as   physical   restraints.   Further,   the   right   to personal   liberty   takes   in   not   only   a   right   to   be free   from   restrictions   placed   on   his   movements, but   also  free  from  encroachments  on  his  private life.   It   is   true   our   Constitution   does   not   expressly declare a right to privacy as a fundamental right, but the   said   right   is   an   essential   ingredient   of   personal liberty.  Every   democratic   country   sanctifies 118 domestic   life;   it   is   expected   to   give   him   rest, physical happiness, peace of mind and security. In the last resort, a person's house, where he lives with his   family,   is   his   “castle”;   it   is   his   rampart   against encroachment   on   his   personal   liberty.   The   pregnant words of that famous Judge, Frankfurter J., in (1948) 338 US 25, pointing out the importance of the security of   one's   privacy   against   arbitrary   intrusion   by   the police,   could   have   no   less   application   to   an   Indian home as to an American one. If physical restraints on a   person's   movements   affect   his   personal   liberty, physical encroachments on his private life would affect it   in   a   larger   degree.   Indeed,   nothing   is   more deleterious to a man's physical happiness and health than   a   calculated   interference   with   his   privacy.  We would,   therefore,   define   the   right   of   personal liberty in Art. 21 as a right of an individual to be free   from   restrictions   or   encroachments   on   his person,   whether   those   restrictions   or encroachments are directly imposed or indirectly brought   about   by   calculated   measures.   It   so understood,   all   the   acts   of   surveillance   under Regulation 236 infringe the fundamental right  of the petitioner under Art. 21 of the Constitution.” As   pointed   out   by   Rohinton   Nariman,   J.,   in  Mohd.   Arif   alias Ashfaq  vs.  Registrar,   Supreme   Court   of   India  &   Ors.90  “The minority judgment of Subba Rao and Shah, JJ. eventually became law   in  Rustom   Cavasjee   Cooper  vs.  Union   of   India91(Bank Nationalisation   case),   where   the   11­Judge   Bench  finally   discarded the   view   expressed   in  A.K.   Gopalan  and   held   that   various 90(2014) 9 SCC 737 91(1970) 1 SCC 248 119 fundamental   rights  contained  in  different   articles   are  not  mutually exclusive …”. 87. If U.P. Police Regulations were challenged in  Kharak Singh, identical Regulations issued by the State of Madhya Pradesh were challenged in Gobind vs. State of Madhya Pradesh92. Though this Court upheld the impugned Regulations, K.K. Mathew, J. pointed out: “25. Rights   and   freedoms   of   citizens   are   set   forth   in the   Constitution   in   order   to   guarantee   that   the individual, his personality, and those things stamped with   his   personality   shall   be   free   from   official interference   except   where   a   reasonable   basis   for intrusion   exists.   “Liberty   against   Government”   a phrase coined by Professor Corwin expresses this idea forcefully.   In   this   sense,   many   of   the   fundamental rights of citizens can be described as contributing to the right to privacy. *** *** *** 27. There   are   two   possible   theories   for   protecting privacy of home. The first is that activities in the home harm others only to the extent that they cause offence resulting from the mere thought that individuals might be engaging in such activities and that such ‘harm’ is not   constitutionally   protectible   by   the   State.The second   is   that   individuals   need   a   place   of sanctuary   where   they   can   be   free   from   societal control.   The   importance   of   such   a   sanctuary   is that individuals can drop the mask, desist for a while from projecting on the world the image they want to be accepted as themselves, an image that may reflect the values of their peers rather than 92(1975) 2 SCC 148 120 the realities of their natures.[See 26 Stanford Law Rev. 1161, 1187]” 88. Thus, the understanding of this Court in  A.K. Gopalan, that deprivation   of   personal   liberty   required   a   physical   restraint, underwent a change in  Kharak Singh  and  Gobind  (supra).  From there,   the   law   marched   to   the   next   stage   in  Satwant   Singh Sawhney vs. D. Ramarathnam, Assistant Passport Officer, New Delhi93  where   a   Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court   held   by   a majority, that the right to personal liberty included the right of locomotion and right to travel abroad. It was held in the said decision   that   “liberty\"   in   our   Constitution   bears   the   same comprehensive meaning as is given to the expression \"liberty\" by the 5th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and the   expression  \"personal   liberty\"  in   Article  21   only  excludes the   ingredients   of   \"liberty\"   enshrined  in Article   19 of   the Constitution. The   Court   went   on   to   hold   that  “the   expression \"personal liberty\" in Art. 21 takes in the right  of loco­motion and   to   travel   abroad,   but   the   right   to   move   throughout   the 93 AIR 1967 SC 1836 121 territories   of   India   is   not   covered   by   it   inasmuch   as   it   is specially provided in Art. 19.” 89. Satwant Singh  (supra)  was the case of  a businessman, who was directed to surrender his passport, with a view to prevent him from travelling out of India, on account of an investigation pending against him under the Export and Import Control Act. It must be noted that this case was before the enactment of The Passports Act, 1967. 90. After   The Passports Act came into  force, the  decision of  the 7­Judge Bench in  Maneka Gandhi  vs.  Union of India94  came. It was held therein that the right to travel abroad is part of the right to   personal   liberty   and   that   the   same   cannot   be   deprived   except according to the procedure established by law. 91. Next came the decision in Bandhua Mukti Morcha vs. Union of India  & Ors. 95. It was a case where a letter addressed by an NGO to the Court exposing the plight of persons working in stone quarries   under   inhuman   conditions,   was   treated   as   a   public 94 (1978) 1 SCC 248 95(1984) 3 SCC 161 122 interest   litigation.   Some   of   those   workers   were   actually   bonded labourers.  After this Court issued notice to the State Governments and the lessees of the quarries, a preliminary objection was raised as   to   the   maintainability   of   the   writ   petition.   While   rejecting   the preliminary   objection,   this   Court   broadly   indicated   how   the fundamental   rights   of   those   bonded   labourers   were   violated   and what were the duties of the State and the Court in cases of that nature. The relevant portion of the decision reads thus: “9. …   We   should   have   thought   that   if   any   citizen brings   before   the   Court   a   complaint   that   a   large number of peasants or workers are bonded serfs or are being subjected to exploitation by a few mine lessees or   contractors   or   employers   or   are   being   denied   the benefits of social welfare laws, the State Government, which   is,   under   our   constitutional   scheme,   charged with   the   mission   of   bringing   about   a   new   socio­ economic   order   where   there   will   be   social   and economic   justice   for   everyone   and   equality   of   status and opportunity for all, would welcome an enquiry by the Court, so that if it is found that there are in fact bonded   labourers   or   even   if   the   workers   are   not bonded in the strict sense of the term as defined in the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 but they are made to provide forced labour or are consigned to a   life   of   utter   deprivation   and   degradation,   such   a situation   can   be   set   right   by   the   State   Government. Even   if   the   State   Government   is   on   its   own   enquiry satisfied that the workmen are not bonded and are not compelled to provide forced labour and are living and working   in   decent   conditions   with   all   the   basic necessities   of   life   provided   to   them,   the   State Government should not baulk an enquiry by the Court when a complaint is brought by a citizen, but it should be anxious to satisfy the Court and through the Court, 123 the   people   of   the   country,   that   it   is   discharging   its constitutional obligation fairly and adequately and the workmen   are   being   ensured   social   and   economic justice. …” 92. Therefore,   three   major   breakthroughs   happened,   the   first   in Kharak   Singh,  the   second   in  Satwant   Singh  and  Maneka Gandhi (supra) and the third in Bandhua Mukti Morcha (supra). The first breakthrough was the opinion, though of a minority, that physical   restraint   was   not   a   necessary  sine   qua   non  for   the deprivation   of   personal   liberty   and   that   even   a   psychological restraint may amount to deprivation of personal liberty. The second breakthrough   was   the   opinion   in  Satwant   Singh  and  Maneka Gandhi that the right of locomotion and to travel abroad are part of the   right   to   personal   liberty.   The   third   breakthrough   was   the opinion   in  Bandhua   Mukti   Morcha  that   the   State   owed   an obligation to take corrective measures when there was an infraction of Article 21. 93. In  National   Human   Rights   Commission  vs.  State   of Arunachal  Pradesh  &  Anr.96, this Court was confronted with a situation where private citizens, namely, the All Arunachal Pradesh 96(1996) 1 SCC 742 124 Students’ Union held out threats to forcibly drive  chakmas,  out of the State. The National Human Rights Commission itself filed a writ petition   under   Article   32.   While   allowing   the   writ   petition   and issuing directions, this Court indicated the role of the State in the following words: “20.  …Thus the State is bound to protect the life and liberty of every human being, be he a citizen or otherwise, and it cannot permit any body or group of persons, e.g., the AAPSU, to threaten the Chakmas to leave the State, failing which they would be forced to do   so.   No   State   Government   worth   the   name   can tolerate   such   threats   by   one   group   of   persons   to another group of persons; it is duty­bound to protect the threatened group from such assaults and if it fails to do so, it will fail to perform its constitutional as well as   statutory   obligations.   Those   giving   such   threats would   be   liable   to   be   dealt   with   in   accordance   with law. The State Government must act impartially and carry   out   its   legal   obligations   to   safeguard   the   life, health and well­being of Chakmas residing in the State without being inhibited by local politics. …” 94. In Mr. ‘X’ vs. Hospital ‘Z’97, the appellant had accompanied a patient to the hospital for treatment and offered to donate blood, for the   purpose   of   surgery.   Before   allowing   him   to   donate   blood, samples   were   taken   from   “X”.   It   was   detected   that   he   was   HIV positive. The fact that Mr. “X” tested positive was disclosed by the 97(1998) 8 SCC 296 125 hospital   to   the   fiancée   of   Mr.   “X”.   Therefore,   the   proposal   for marriage   was   called   off   and   Mr.   “X”   was   ostracised   by   the community.   Mr.   “X”   sued   the   hospital   for   damages,   pitching   his claim on the right to privacy and the duty of confidentiality that the hospital   had   in   their   relationship   with   him.   Though   this   Court partly agreed with Mr. “X” the court found that the disclosure made by the hospital actually saved the life of a lady. But while dealing with   a   right   under   Article   21  vis­à­vis  the   hospital   (a   private hospital), this Court held as follows :­ “27.  Right   of   privacy   may,   apart   from   contract, also arise out of a particular specific relationship which   may   be   commercial,   matrimonial,   or   even political.  As   already   discussed   above,  doctor­patient relationship,   though   basically   commercial,   is, professionally,   a   matter   of   confidence   and,   therefore, doctors   are   morally   and   ethically   bound   to   maintain confidentiality. In such a situation, public disclosure of even true private facts may amount to an invasion of the right of privacy which may sometimes lead to the clash   of   one   person's   “right   to   be   let   alone”   with another person's right to be informed. 28.  Disclosure   of   even   true   private   facts   has   the tendency   to   disturb   a   person's   tranquillity.   It   may generate many complexes in him and may even lead to psychological   problems.   He   may,   thereafter,   have   a disturbed   life   all   through.   In   the   face   of   these potentialities, and as already held by this Court in its various decisions referred to above, the right of privacy is an essential component of the right to life envisaged by Article 21. The right, however, is not absolute and 126 may be lawfully restricted for the prevention of crime, disorder or protection of health or morals or protection of rights and freedom of others.” 95. In  Pt.   Parmanand   Katara  (supra),  a  human   rights  activist filed a writ petition under Article 32 seeking a direction to the Union of   India   that   every   injured   person   brought   for   treatment   to   a hospital should instantaneously be given medical aid to preserve life and that the procedural Criminal Law should be allowed to operate thereafter. The basis of the said writ petition was a report about a scooterist who got injured in a road traffic accident, being turned away   by   the   nearby   hospital   on   the   ground   that   they   were   not authorized to handle medico­legal cases.  Before the victim could be taken   to   an   authorized   hospital   located   20   kilometers   away,   he died,   which   prompted   the   writ   petition.   While   issuing   directions, this Court expressed an opinion about the affirmative duty of court in paragraph 8 as follows:­ “8.  Article   21   of   the   Constitution   casts   the obligation   on   the   State   to   preserve   life.   The provision   as   explained   by   this   Court   in   scores   of decisions   has   emphasized   and   reiterated   with gradually increasing emphasis that position. A doctor at   the   government   hospital   positioned   to   meet   this State   obligation   is,   therefore,   duty   bound   to   extend medical   assistance   for   preserving   life.  Every   doctor 127 whether   at   a   government   hospital   or   otherwise has   the   professional   obligation   to   extend   his services with due expertise for protecting life.  No law   or   State   action   can   intervene   to   avoid/delay   the discharge   of   the   paramount   obligation   cast   upon members   of   the   medical   profession.  The   obligation being   total,   absolute   and   paramount,   laws   of procedure whether in statutes or otherwise which would   interfere   with   the   discharge   of   this obligation   cannot   be   sustained   and   must, therefore, give way.…” That the State has an obligation to help preserve life, guaranteed under Article 21 was spelt out clearly in  Pt. Parmanand Katara. What   applies   to   life   applies   equally   to   personal   liberty.   This   is because there may be cases involving both the right to life as well as liberty.  96. For   instance,   in  Suchita   Srivastava  &   Anr.    vs. Chandigarh   Administration98,this   Court   had   an   occasion   to consider the reproductive rights of a mentally­challenged woman. This right  was  read  as part  of  the right to  life and  liberty  under Article   21.   In  Devika   Biswas  vs.  Union   of   India.99,   this   Court considered   certain   issues   concerning   the   entire   range   of   conduct and   management,   under   the   auspices   of   State   Governments,   of 98(2009) 9 SCC 1 99(2016) 10 SCC 726 128 sterilization   procedures,   either   in   camps   or   in   accredited   centres and held that the right to health and reproductive rights of a person are part of the right under Article 21. While doing so, this Court quoted   with   approval   the   decision   in  Bandhua   Mukti   Morcha where the obligation of the State to ensure that the fundamental rights   of   weaker   sections   of   society   are   not   exploited,   was underlined. 97. Tapping   of  telephones  in   exercise   of  the   power   conferred   by Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 became the subject matter of challenge in  People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) vs.  Union   of   India100.   This   Court   held   that   conversation   on telephone   is   an   important   facet   of   a   man’s   private   life   and   that tapping   of   telephone   would   infringe   Article   21.   Technological eavesdropping except in accordance with the procedure established by law was frowned upon by the Court. This was at a time when mobile phones had not become the order of the day and the State monopoly   was   yet   to   be   replaced   by   private   players   such   as intermediaries/service   providers.   Today,   the   infringement   of   the 100(1997) 1 SCC 301 129 right   to   privacy   is   mostly   by   private   players   and   if   fundamental rights cannot be enforced against non­State actors, this right will go for a toss. 98. In District Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad & Anr.  vs. Canara   Bank  &   Ors.101,  what   was   under   challenge   was   an amendment made to The Indian Stamp Act, 1899 by the State of Andhra   Pradesh,   empowering   a   public   officer   to   inspect   the registers,   books,   papers   and   documents   kept   in   any   premises, including a private place where such registers, books etc., are kept. Taking   cue   from   the   decision   in  R.   Rajagopal  and  Maneka Gandhi, this Court held in paragraphs 55 and 56 of the decision as follows:­ “55. The   A.P.   Amendment   permits   inspection   being carried   out   by   the   Collector   by   having   access   to   the documents   which   are   in private   custody i.e.   custody other than that of a public officer. It is clear that this provision empowers invasion of the home of the person in   whose   possession   the   documents   “tending”   to   or leading to the various facts stated in Section 73 are in existence   and   Section   73   being   one   without   any safeguards   as   to   probable   or   reasonable   cause   or reasonable   basis   or   materials   violates   the   right   to privacy both of the house and of the person. We have already referred to R. Rajagopal case [(1994) 6 SCC 632] 101(2005) 1 SCC 496 130 wherein the learned Judges have held that the right to personal liberty also means life free from encroachments unsustainable   in   law,   and   such   right   flowing   from Article 21 of the Constitution. 56. In Maneka   Gandhi v. Union   of   India [(1978)   1   SCC 248]  a  seven­Judge  Bench  decision,   P.N.   Bhagwati,  J. (as   His   Lordship   then   was)   held   that   the   expression “personal liberty” in Article 21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional   protection under   Article   19   (emphasis supplied). Any law interfering with personal liberty of a person must satisfy a triple test: (i) it must prescribe a procedure; (ii) the procedure must withstand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article 19 which may be applicable in a given situation; and (iii) it must also be liable to be tested with reference to   Article   14.   As   the   test   propounded   by   Article   14 pervades   Article   21   as   well,   the   law   and   procedure authorising interference with personal liberty and right of privacy must also be right and just and fair and not arbitrary,   fanciful   or   oppressive.   If   the   procedure prescribed does not satisfy the requirement of Article 14 it would be no procedure at all within the meaning of Article 21.” 99. In  Indian   Woman   says   Gang­raped   on   orders   of   village Court   published   in   Business   and   Financial   News   dated 23­1­2014, in Re102, this Court was dealing with a  suo motu  writ petition   relating   to   the   gang­rape   of   a   women   under   orders   of   a community panchayat as punishment for having a relationship with a man belonging to a different community. After taking note of two 102(2014) 4 SCC 786 131 earlier   decisions,   one   in  Lata   Singh  vs.  State   of   U.P.103  which dealt   with   honour   killings   of   youngsters   involved   in   inter­caste, inter­religious  marriages and  the  other  in  Arumugam  Servai  vs. State of Tamil Nadu104, which dealt with  khap panchayats, this Court opined in paragraph 16 as follows:­ “16. Ultimately, the question which ought to consider and assess by this Court is whether the State police machinery   could   have   possibly   prevented   the   said occurrence.  The response is certainly a “yes”. The State   is   duty­bound   to   protect   the   fundamental rights   of   its   citizens;   and   an   inherent   aspect   of Article   21   of   the   Constitution   would   be   the freedom   of   choice   in   marriage.   Such   offences   are resultant   of   the   State's   incapacity   or   inability   to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens.” In   fact,   this   Court   observed   in   the   aforesaid   decision   that   the obligation of the State does not get extinguished upon payment of compensation   and   that   the   rehabilitation   of   the   victims   of   such nature was a must. 100.     In  Shakti   Vahini  vs.  Union   of   India  &   Ors.105,  while dealing   with   a   writ   petition   seeking   a   direction   to   the   State Governments and Central Government to take preventive measures 103(2006) 5 SCC 475 104(2011) 6 SCC 405 105(2018) 7 SCC 192 132 to combat honour crimes and to submit a National/State plan of action,   this   Court   issued   a   slew   of   directions   directing   the   State Governments to take both punitive and remedial measures, on the ground that the State has a positive obligation to protect the life and liberty of persons.   In paragraph 49 this Court said, “We are disposed to think so, as it is the obligation of the State to have an atmosphere   where   the   citizens   are   in   a   position   to   enjoy   their fundamental   rights.”  After   quoting   the   previous   decision   in  S. Rangarajan  (supra),  which   arose   out   of   the   infringement   of   the freedom of expression in respect of a cinematograph film, this Court said in Shakti Vahini (supra) as follows:­ “49. … We   are   absolutely   conscious   that   the   aforesaid passage has been stated in respect of a different fundamental right, but the said principle applies with   more   vigour   when   the   life   and   liberty   of individuals is  involved. We  say so  reminding  the States   of   their   constitutional   obligations   to comfort,   nurture   the   sustenance   of   fundamental rights of the citizens and not to allow any hostile group to create any kind of trench in them.” 101.   At   last,   while   dealing   with   the   right   to   privacy,   in  Justice K.S.   Puttaswamy,   this   Court   made   it   clear   that,   “it   is   a   right 133 which   protects   the   inner   sphere   of   the   individuals   from interference by both the State and non­State actors”. 102.  Before we conclude this chapter, we must point out that some academics feel that the same level of justification for infringement by the State, for all rights recognized by the Court, end up being problematic106  and   that   the   idea   of   a   hierarchy   of   rights,   as articulated by Das, J. in  A.K. Gopalan  may have to be examined. In fact, Rohinton Nariman, J. articulated this idea in Mohd. Arif (supra) where the question was as to whether a petition for review in the Supreme Court should be heard in open Court at least in death penalty cases. The learned Judge said: “36.  If a pyramidical structure is to be imagined, with   life   on   top,   personal   liberty   (and   all   the rights   it   encompasses   under   the   new   doctrine) immediately   below   it   and   other   fundamental rights   below   personal   liberty   it   is   obvious   that this   judgment   will   apply   only   to   death   sentence cases.  In most  other cases, the  factors  mentioned  by Krishna   Iyer,   J.   in   particular   the   Supreme   Court’s overcrowded   docket,   and   the   fact   that   a   full   oral hearing has preceded judgment of a criminal appeal on merits, may tilt the balance the other way.” 106Anup Surendranath in his Article “Life and Personal Liberty” in The Oxford Handbook of  the Indian Constitution (South Asia Edition), 2016 134 Therefore, the importance of the right to personal liberty over and above all the other rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 14 need hardly to be over­emphasized. 103.  Therefore, our answer to Question No.3 would be that the State is under a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a person under Article 21, whenever there is a threat to personal liberty, even by a non­State actor. Question No.4  104.   Question No.4 referred to us is this: “Can a statement made by a Minister, traceable to any affairs of the State or for protecting the Government, be attributed vicariously to the Government itself, especially in view of the principle of Collective Responsibility?” 105.   The   above   question   revolves   around   the   role   and responsibility of a Minister and the vicarious liability/responsibility of a Government to any statement made by him. For answering the said question, we may need to understand the role of a Minister under our Constitutional scheme. 135 106.   Part   V   of   the   Constitution   providing   for   matters   connected with “The Union” contains five chapters, dealing respectively with, (i)  the   Executive;  (ii)  Parliament;  (iii)  Legislative   powers   of   the President; (iv) the Union Judiciary; and (v) Comptroller and Auditor General   of   India.   Part   VI   of   the   Constitution   dealing   with   “The States” contains six chapters, dealing respectively with,  (i)  general provision containing the definitions; (ii) the Executive; (iii) the State Legislature;  (iv)  Legislative   power   of   the   Governor;  (v)  the   High Courts in the States; and (vi) Subordinate Courts. 107.  While Articles 74 and 75 provide for, (i) ‘Council of Ministers to   aid   and   advise   the   President’;   and  (ii)  ‘Other   provisions   as   to Ministers’, insofar as the Union is concerned, Articles 163 and 164 provide for, (i) ‘Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor’; and (ii) ‘Other provisions as to Ministers’, insofar as the States are concerned. Similarly, Article 77 provides for the conduct of business of the Government of India and Article 166 provides for the conduct of business of the Government of a State. The duties of the Prime 136 Minister   are   dealt   with   in   Article   78   and   the   duties   of   Chief Ministers are dealt with in Article 167. 108.   Article 75(3) states that “the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People.”   Similarly, Article   164(2)   states   “the   Council   of   Ministers   shall   be   collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State”. 109.   Generally,   all   executive   action   of   the   Government   of   India shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the President under Article   77(1).   However,   for   more   convenient   transaction   of   the business   of   the   Government   of   India,   the   President   shall   make Rules.   These   Rules   shall   also   provide   for   the   allocation   of   the business   among   Ministers.   This   is   under   Article   77(3).   Similar provisions are found in sub­Articles (1) and (3) of Article 166. 110.   There are special duties assigned to the Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers, under Articles 78 and 167 respectively.   111.   While   dealing   with   the   scheme   of   Article   166(3),   the Constitution Bench of this Court pointed out in A. Sanjeevi Naidu 137 vs. State of Madras107, that under our Constitution, the Governor is essentially a constitutional head and the administration of the State is run by the Council of Ministers.  Since it is impossible for the Council of Ministers to deal with each and every  matter that comes   before   the   Government,   the   Governor   is   authorized   under Article 166(3) to make Rules for the more convenient transaction of the   business   of   the   Government   of   the   State   and   for   allocation amongst   its   Ministers   the   business   of   the   Government.  In paragraph   10   of   the   said   decision,   the   Constitution   Bench spoke   about   “joint   responsibility”   and   not   about   collective responsibility.   The   relevant   portion   of   paragraph   10   reads   as follows: “10. The cabinet is responsible to the Legislature for   every   action   taken   in   any   of   the   Ministries. That   is   the   essence   of   joint   responsibility.   That does not mean that each and every decision must be taken by the cabinet. The political responsibility of the Council of Ministers does not and cannot predicate the personal responsibility  of  the  Council of Ministers  to discharge   all   or   any   of   the   Governmental   functions. Similarly  an individual Minister  is responsible to the Legislature   for   every   action   taken   or   omitted   to   be taken   in   his   ministry.   This   again   is   a   political 107 (1970) 1 SCC 443 138 responsibility   and   not   personal   responsibility.   …” 112. The expression “collective responsibility” can be traced to some extent,   to   Article   75(3)   insofar   as   the   Union   is   concerned   and   to Article 164(2) insofar as the States are concerned. But in both the Articles,   it   is   the   Council   of   Ministers   who   are   stated   to   be collectively   responsible   to   the   House   of   the   People/Legislative Assembly of the State.  Generally collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers either to the House of the People or to the Assembly   should   be   understood   to   correlate   to   the   decisions and   actions   of   the   Council   of   Ministers   and   not   to   every statement made by every individual Minister. 113. In  State   of   Karnataka  vs.  Union   of   India.108,  a   Seven Member   Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court,   while   dealing   with   a challenge made by the State of Karnataka in the form of a civil suit under Article 131, to the appointment by the Central Government, of a  commission  of  enquiry   against the  Chief Minister  of  Karnataka, had an occasion to consider the exposition of the words “collective 108 (1977) 4 SCC 608 139 responsibility”   appearing   in   Article   164(2).   After   indicating   that collective   responsibility   is   basically   political   in   origin   and mode of operation, Beg, C.J. opined in the said case as follows: “46. The   object   of   collective   responsibility   is   to make   the   whole   body   of   persons   holding Ministerial   office   collectively,   or,   if   one   may   so put   it,   “vicariously”   responsible  for   such  acts   of the   others   as   are   referable   to   their   collective volition so that, even if an individual may not be personally   responsible   for   it,   yet,   he   will   be deemed to share the responsibility with those who may have actually committed some wrong. … 47. Each Minister can be and is separately responsible for   his   own   decisions   and   acts   and   omissions   also. But, inasmuch as the Council of Ministers is able to stay in office only so long as it commands the support and   confidence   of   a   majority   of   members   of   the Legislature of the State, the whole Council of Ministers must   be   held   to   be   politically   responsible   for   the decisions and policies of each of the Ministers and of his department which could be presumed to have the support   of   the   whole   Ministry.   Hence,   the   whole Ministry   will,   at   least   on   issues   involving   matters   of policy, have to be  treated  as  one entity  so far  as  its answerability to the Legislative Assembly representing the electors is concerned. This is the meaning of the principle underlying Article 164(2) of the Constitution. The purpose of this provision is not to find out facts or to   establish   the   actual   responsibility   of   a   Chief Minister   or   any   other   Minister   or   Ministers   for particular decisions or Governmental acts. That can be more suitably done, when wrongful acts or decisions are   complained   of,   by   means   of   inquiries   under   the Act.   As   already   indicated   above,   the   procedure   of Parliamentary Committees to inquire into every legally or ethically wrong act was found to be unsatisfactory and   unsound.   The   principle   of   individual   as   well   as 140 collective   ministerial   responsibility   can   work   most efficiently only when cases requiring proper sifting and evaluation   of   evidence   and   discussion   of   questions involved have taken place, where this is required, in proceedings   before   a   Commission   appointed   under Section 3 of the Act. 48. Text­book   writers   on   Constitutional   Law   have indicated   how   collective   ministerial   responsibility   to Parliament,   which   has  essentially   a  political  purpose and   effects,   developed   later   than   individual responsibility   of   Ministers   to   Parliament   which   was also political in origin and operation. It is true that an individual   Minister   could,   in   England,   where   the principle   of   individual   and   collective   responsibility   of Ministers   was   evolved,   be   responsible   either   for wrongful acts done by him without the authority of the whole cabinet or of the monarch to support them, or under orders of the King who could, in the eye of law, do no wrong. But, apart from an impeachment, which has become obsolete, or punishment for contempts of a   House,   which   constitute   only   a   limited   kind   of offences, the Parliament does not punish the offender. For establishing his legal liability recourse to ordinary courts of law is indispensable.” 114. Quoting  from  Wade and Phillips on Constitutional Law, this Court   pointed   out   in   the  State   of   Karnataka  (supra)  that “responsibility to Parliament only means that the Minster may be compelled by convention to resign.” 115. The extent to which the enforcement of collective responsibility can be taken was also indicated in the above decision as follows: “50. The   whole   question   of   responsibility   is related   to   the   continuance   of   a   Minister   or   a 141 Government   in   office.   A   Minister's   own   acts   or omissions or those of others in the department in his   charge,   for   which   he   may   feel   morally responsible,   or,   for   which   others   may   hold   him morally responsible, may compel him to resign. By an   extension   of   this   logic,   applied   to   individual Ministers at first, emerged the principle of “collective responsibility” which we find enacted in Articles 75(2) and 164(2) of our Constitution. The only sanction for its   enforcement   is   the   pressure   of   public   opinion expressed   particularly   in   terms   of   withdrawal   of political   support   by   members   of   Parliament   or   the State Legislature as the case may be.” 116.  In other words, this Court indicated that while a Minister may be   compelled   to   resign   for   his   individual   acts   of   omission   or commission, the only sanction for the enforcement of collective responsibility is the “pressure of public opinion”. 117.  In R.K. Jain vs. Union of India109, this Court was concerned with   a   public   interest   litigation   relating   to   the   functioning   of   the Customs, Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal. At that time the office of the President of the Tribunal was lying vacant for over six months. But after rule nisi was issued in the first writ petition, the   Government   appointed   someone   as   the   President   of   the Tribunal. Immediately, a second writ petition was filed challenging the appointment and also some of the recruitment rules relating to 109(1993) 4 SCC 119 142 the appointment.The file relating to the appointment was produced in a sealed cover and the Government claimed privilege in terms of Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and Article 74(2) of the   Constitution.   While   dealing   with   the   executive   power   of   the President and the role of the Council of Ministers, K.Ramasamy, J., said “The principle of ministerial responsibility has a variety of   meanings   precise   and   imprecise,   authentic   and   vague”. Paragraphs 29 and 30  of the report  in  R.K. Jain  (supra)  may be usefully extracted as follows: “29. It would thus be held that the Cabinet known as Council of Ministers headed by Prime Minister under Article   75(3)   is   the   driving   and   steering   body responsible   for   the   governance   of   the   country.   They enjoy the confidence of the Parliament and remain in office so long as they maintain the confidence of the majority. They  are answerable to the Parliament and accountable   to   the   people.   They   bear   collective responsibility and shall be bound to maintain secrecy. Their   executive   function   comprises   of   both   the determination of the policy as well as carrying it into execution, the initiation of legislation, the maintenance of order, the promotion of social and economic welfare, direction of foreign policy. In short the carrying on or supervision of the general administration of the affairs of Union of India which includes political activity and carrying   on   all   trading   activities,   the   acquisition, holding   and   disposal   of   property   and   the   making   of contracts   for   any   purpose.   In   short   the   primary function of the Cabinet is to formulate the policies of the   Government   in   conformity   with   the   directive principles of the Constitution for the governance of the nation;   place   the   same   before   the   Parliament   for 143 acceptance and to carry on the executive function of the State as per the provisions of the Constitution and the laws. 30. Collective responsibility under Article 75(3) of the   Constitution   inheres   maintenance   of confidentiality as enjoined in oaths of office and of secrecy   set   forth   in   Schedule   III   of   the Constitution  that   the   Minister   will   not   directly   or indirectly   communicate   or   reveal   to   any   person   or persons   any   matter   which   shall   be   brought   under his/her   consideration   or   shall   become   known   to him/her as Minister except as may be required for the “due discharge of his/her duty as Minister”. The base and   basic   postulate   of   its   significance   is unexceptionable.   But   the   need   for   and   effect   of confidentiality   has   to   be   nurtured   not   merely   from political   imperatives   of   collective   responsibility envisaged   by   Article   75(3)   but   also   from   its pragmatism.” 118.    In   paragraph   33   of   the   report   in  R.K.   Jain,  this   Court indicated that the Cabinet as a whole is collectively responsible for the advice tendered to the President and for the conduct of business of each of his/her department. The question as to what happens when   an   individual   Minister   is   in   total   disagreement   with   the collective decision of the Cabinet was also spelt out in R.K. Jain in the following words: “33.  ...Each   member   of   the   Cabinet   has   personal responsibility to his conscience and also responsibility to the Government.  Discussion and persuasion may diminish  disagreement, reach  unanimity,  or  leave it unaltered. Despite persistence of disagreement, 144 it is a decision, though some members like it less than   others.   Both   practical   politics   and   good government   require   that   those   who   like   it   less must still publicly support it. If such support is too great   a   strain   on   a   Minister's   conscience   or incompatible   to   his/her   perceptions   of commitment   and   he/she   finds   it   difficult   to support the decision, it would be open to him/her to  resign.  So the  price of the  acceptance  of  Cabinet office   is   the   assumption   of   the   responsibility   to support   Cabinet   decisions.   The   burden   of   that responsibility is shared by all.” 119.    In  Secretary,   Jaipur   Development   Authority,   Jaipur (supra),   the   abuse   of   official   position   by   the   Minister   of   Urban Development and Housing Department and the officers working in the   Jaipur   Development   Authority   in   the   matter   of   allotment   of plots became the subject matter. While dealing with the question of individual   and   collective   accountability   and   responsibility   of Ministers, this Court said in paragraph 10 as follows: “10.  ...The Governor  runs the Executive Government of a State with the aid and advice of the Chief Minister and   the   Council   of   Ministers   which   exercise   the powers   and   performs   its   duties   by   the   individual Ministers as public officers with the assistance of the bureaucracy   working   in   various   departments   and corporate   sectors   etc.   Though   they   are   expressed   in the name of the Governor, each Minister is personally and  collectively  responsible   for   the   actions,   acts   and policies. They are accountable and answerable to the people. Their powers and duties are regulated by the law and the rules. The legal and moral responsibility 145 or   liability   for   the   acts   done   or   omissions,   duties performed   and   policy   laid   down   rest   solely   on   the Minister   of   the   Department.   Therefore,   they   are indictable for their conduct or omission, or misconduct or   misappropriation.  The   Council   of   Ministers   are jointly   and   severally   responsible   to   the Legislature.   He/they   is/are   also   publicly accountable   for   the   acts   or   conducts   in   the performance of duties.” 120.  Again, in paragraph 11, this Court outlined the responsibility of the Ministers as follows: “11. The   Minister   holds   public   office   though   he   gets constitutional   status   and   performs   functions   under the   Constitution,   law   or   executive   policy.   The   acts done and duties performed are public acts or duties as the holder of public office. Therefore, he owes certain accountability for the acts done or duties performed. In a democratic society governed by rule of law, power is conferred on the holder  of the public office or the authority   concerned   by   the   Constitution  by   virtue   of appointment. The holder  of  the  office, therefore,  gets opportunity   to   abuse   or   misuse   the   office.   The politician who holds public office must perform public duties   with   the   sense   of   purpose,   and   a   sense   of direction,   under   rules   or   sense   of   priorities.   The purpose must be genuine in a free democratic society governed by the rule of law to further socio­economic democracy.   The   Executive   Government   should   frame its   policies   to   maintain   the   social   order,   stability, progress and morality. All actions of the Government are   performed   through/by   individual   persons   in collective   or   joint   or   individual   capacity.   Therefore, they should morally be responsible for their actions.” 121.    In  Vineet   Narain  vs.  Union   of   India.110,   this   Court   was concerned   with   a   public   interest   litigation   under   Article   32 110(1998) 1 SCC 226 146 complaining about the inaction on the part of the Central Bureau of Investigation   in   a   matter   relating   to   the   disclosures   contained   in what came to be known as  “Jain Diaries”.  After taking note of the Report   of   Lord   Nolan   on  “Standards   in   Public   Life”,   this   Court issued   certain   directions,   though   confined   only   to   the   Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate and Prosecution Agency.   But   Lord   Nolan’s   Report   dealt   mainly   with   principles   of public life and code of conduct. 122.    The   decision   in  Common   Cause  was   little   peculiar   and riddled with some problems. The allotment of petroleum outlets by the then  Minister  of State for  Petroleum  and Natural Gas, under what was claimed to be a discretionary quota, was first set aside by this   Court   by   a   judgment   reported   in   (1996)   6   SCC   530. Simultaneously,   a   show­cause   notice   was   issued   to   the   then Minister   Capt.   Satish   Sharma   as   to   why   a   criminal   complaint should   not   be   lodged   against   him   and   why   he   should   not   be directed   to   pay   damages   for   his  malafide  action   in   wrongfully allotting   the   petrol   outlets.   After   the   Minister   responded   to   the show­cause notice, an order was passed, reported in (1996) 6 SCC 147 593,   directing   the   Minister   to   pay   exemplary   damages   and   also directing  the initiation of prosecution. Later, a petition for review was   filed  by  the   Minister   for   recalling   the   order   which   directed payment of exemplary damages and also the registration of a case by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The decision in the petition for review, reported in (1999) 6 SCC 667, dealt with the question of collective responsibility in the context of the contention raised. It was argued by the delinquent Minister in the said case that under the   business   rules   of   the   Cabinet,   the   act   of   a   Minister   is   to   be treated as the act of the President or the Governor as the case may be and that therefore the allotment made by him should be treated to have been made while acting only on behalf of the President.  As an   extension   of   this   argument,   it   was   also   contended   that   the Minister having acted as a part of the Council of Ministers, his act should be treated to be the act of the entire Cabinet on the principle of collective responsibility. While rejecting the said contention, this Court held in  Common Cause  that the immunity available to the President under Article 361 of the Constitution cannot be extended to   the   orders   passed   in   the   name   of   the   President   under   Article 148 77(1) or 77(2). Dealing with the concept of collective responsibility, this Court held in paragraph 31 as follows: “31. The   concept   of   “collective   responsibility”   is essentially   a   political   concept.   The   country   is governed   by   the   party   in   power   on   the   basis   of   the policies   adopted   and   laid   down   by   it   in   the   Cabinet meeting. “Collective responsibility” has two meanings: the first meaning which can legitimately be ascribed to it is that all members of a Government are unanimous in   support   of   its   policies   and   would   exhibit   that unanimity   on   public   occasions   although   while formulating the policies, they might have expressed a different view in the meeting of the Cabinet. The other meaning is that Ministers, who had an opportunity to speak   for   or   against   the   policies   in   the   Cabinet   are thereby   personally   and   morally   responsible   for   its success and failure.” 123.    After   having   dealt   with   the   concept   of   collective responsibility, this Court carved out an exception in paragraph 34 as follows:  “34. From the above, it will be seen that in spite of the fact   that   the   Council   of   Ministers   is   collectively responsible to the House of the People, there may be an occasion where the conduct of a Minister may be censured if he or his subordinates have blundered and have acted contrary to law.” 124.   Again in paragraph 36 this Court held as follows: “36. Even in England, all Ministers and servants of the Crown are accountable to the courts for the legality of their  actions,  and  may   be  held  civilly  and  criminally liable,   in   their   individual   capacities,   for   tortious   or criminal acts. This liability may be enforced either by 149 means of ordinary criminal or civil proceedings or by means   of   impeachment,   a   remedy   which   is   probably obsolete.  They  are also subject  to  the  judicial  review jurisdiction   of   the   courts.   [See: Halsbury's   Laws   of England, Fourth Edn., (Re­issue), Vol. 8(2), para 422.]” 125.    In  State   (NCT   of   Delhi)  vs.  Union   of   India111,   the Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court   was   concerned   with   the interpretation of Article 239AA of the Constitution. The concept of collective responsibility was dealt with extensively by Dipak Misra, C.J., as he then was, from paragraphs 82 to 85. In his independent but concurring  opinion Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. also dealt with the   question   of   collective   responsibility   from   paragraphs   318 onwards. 126.    What   follows   from   the   above   discussion   is,  (i)  that   the concept of collective responsibility is essentially a political concept; (ii)  that   the   collective   responsibility   is   that   of   the   Council   of Ministers; and (iii) that such collective responsibility is to the House of   the   People/Legislative   Assembly   of   the   State.   Generally,   such responsibility correlates to  (i)  the decisions taken; and  (ii)  the acts of omission and commission done. It is not possible to extend this 111(2018) 8 SCC 501 150 concept of collective responsibility to any and every statement orally made   by   a   Minister   outside   the   House   of   the   People/Legislative Assembly. 127.    Shri   Kaleeswaram  Raj,   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the special leave petitioner drew our attention to the code of conduct for Ministers   of   the   Government   of   Australia,   code   of   conduct   for Ministers of the Government of India and the Ministerial Code of the United Kingdom. However, attractive such prescriptions may be, it is not possible to enforce such code of conduct in a court of law. Government   servants   stand   on   a   different   footing,   as   any misconduct   on   their   part   with   reference   to   the   Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, may attract disciplinary action under the Civil   Services   (Discipline   and   Appeal)   Rules.   Even   in   the   case   of Government   servants,   it   may   not   be   possible   to   justify   a dismissal/removal from service on the basis of a statement uttered by   a Government servant, as  it may  not  pass the  proportionality test, viz­a­viz the gravity of the misconduct.  128.    The   suggestion   made   by  Shri   Kaleeswaram   Raj   that   the Prime Minister, in the case of a Minister of the Union of India and 151 the Chief Minister, in the case of a Minister of the State should be allowed to take appropriate action, against the erring Minister, is just fanciful. The Prime Minister or the Chief Minister does not have disciplinary control over the members of the Council of Ministers. It is true that in practice, a strong Prime Minister or Chief Minister will   be   able   to   drop   any   Minister   out   of   the   Cabinet.   But   in   a country like ours where there is a multi­party system and where coalition   Governments   are   often   formed,   it   is   not   possible   at   all times   for   a   Prime   Minister/Chief   Minister   to   take   the   whip, whenever   a   statement   is   made   by   someone   in   the   Council   of Ministers. 129.   Governments which survive on wafer­thin majority (of which we have seen quite a bit), sometimes have individual Ministers who are strong enough to decide the very survival of such Governments. This problem is not unique to our country. 130.    We   have   followed   the   Westminster   Model   but   the Westminster Model itself became shaky after the United Kingdom saw   the   first   coalition   Government   in   2010,   since   the   Churchill Caretaker Ministry of 1945. It is interesting to note that in a Report 152 submitted   by   the   Constitution   Committee   (UK)   in   the   year   2014, under the title, “Constitutional Implications of Coalition Government” it was pointed out that “collective ministerial responsibility has been   the   convention   most   affected   by   coalition   Government”. The Report proceeds to state that the coalition Government formed in   2010   (in   UK)   set   out   five   specific   issues   on   which   the   parties would   agree   to   differ.   But,   in   reality   the   number   of   areas   of disagreement   has   been   greater   resulting   on   one   occasion,   in Ministers being whipped to vote in opposite lobbies and on another, in MPs on the Treasury Benches attempting to amend the Address on the Queen’s speech. 131.  In the “Briefing Paper” (Number 7755, 14 November 2016) on “Collective responsibility” by Michael Everett available in the House of Commons Library,  (i)  the early  origins and development of the concept   of   collective   responsibility;  (ii)  what   is   collective responsibility;  (iii)  the conventions of collective responsibility; and (iv)  departures   from   collective   responsibility   are   dealt   with.   This Paper   traces   early   beginnings   of   the   doctrine   of   collective responsibility to the reign of George III (1760­1820). According to 153 the Briefing Paper, the development of today’s concept of collective responsibility   arose   during   the   Victorian   golden   age   of Parliamentary Government. In fact, the Briefing Paper quotes some commentators   who   have   questioned   whether   the   convention   of collective responsibility remains appropriate for the Government of today.   The   Briefing   Paper   quotes   Barry   Winetrobe,   a   Research Fellow   at   the   Constitution   Unit   who   said  that   the   doctrine   of collective responsibility was developed at a time when a sense of coherence was required to be maintained among disparate ministerial forces in the face of the Monarch and that it is not necessarily appropriate in an age, not just of democracy, but of greater and more direct participative democracy. 132.    It will be useful to quote a portion of Chapter 2.3 under the heading “Enforcing collective responsibility” from the Briefing Paper as follows: “…Dr Felicity Matthews, Senior Lecturer in Governance and Public Policy at the University of Sheffield, has also argued   that   the   respect   accorded   to   the   doctrine   of collective   responsibility   “has   varied”,   with   its maintenance and disregard “owing as much to politics as to propriety”. 154 An interesting example of this occurred in 2003 during the build­up to the Iraq war. Robin Cook, the Leader of the House of Commons, resigned in protest  in March 2003 over the then Labour Government’s policy toward Iraq, being unable to maintain the official Government position. His actions were therefore consistent with the doctrine   of   collective   responsibility.   However,   Clare Short,   the   Secretary   of   State   for   International Development,   was   allowed   to   stay   in   the   Cabinet despite   her   own   vocal   opposition   to   military intervention and despite publicly denouncing the then Prime Minister as “deeply reckless” in March 2003. According   to   Felicity   Matthews,   despite   her “extraordinary breach” of collective responsibility, Clare Short   was   persuaded   and   allowed   to   retain   her ministerial portfolio. She then remained in the Cabinet for a further two months, until she decided to resign on 12   May   2003,   following   perceived   mistakes   in   the US/UK   coalition   after   the   invasion.   This   example, according to Matthews, “underlines the extent to which Prime   Ministers   have   proven   unwilling   or   unable   to enforce   a   strict   interpretation   of   collective responsibility, even when their personal credibility has been besmirched”. 133.   Thus, the convention developed in the United Kingdom  for Ministers, itself appears to have gone for a toss and hence, it is not possible to draw any inspiration from the UK Model. 134.   We are not suggesting for a moment that any public official including a Minister can make a statement which is irresponsible or in bad taste or bordering on hate speech and get away with it.  We are   only   on   the   question   of   collective   responsibility   and   the vicarious liability of the Government. 155 135.    As   all   the   literature   on   the   issue   shows,   collective responsibility  is that  of  the Council of Ministers. Each individual Minister   is   responsible   for   the   decisions   taken   collectively  by   the Council of Ministers.  In other words, the flow of stream in collective responsibility   is   from   the   Council   of   Ministers   to   the   individual Ministers.   The   flow   is   not   on   the   reverse,   namely,   from   the individual Ministers to the Council of Ministers. 136.  Our attention was also drawn to the decision of this Court in Amish   Devgan.   Though   the   said   decision   considered   extensively the impact of the speech of “a person of influence”, we are not, in this reference dealing with the same. This is for the reason that the said   decision   concerned   “hate   speech”.     None   of   the   questions referred to us, including Question No.4 with which we are presently concerned, relates to hate speech, and understandably so. The writ petition   as   well   as   the   special   leave   petition   out   of   which   this reference arose, concerned speeches made by the Ministers of the State of Uttar Pradesh and the State of Kerala. The speech made by the Minister of the State of Uttar Pradesh attempted to paint a case of robbery and gang­rape as a political conspiracy. The speech of 156 the   Minister   of   the   State   of   Kerala   portrayed   women   in   a disrespectful way. Since the statements concerned in both the cases were   attributed   to   the   Ministers,   Question   No.4   referred   to   us, specifically   relates   to   “statement   made   by   a   Minister”.  Amish Devgan  did not deal with the statement of a Minister traceable to any   affairs   of   the   State,   though   a   Minister   would   fall   under   the category   of   “person   of   influence”.   Moreover,   the   statements attributed   to   the   Ministers   in   the   cases   on   hand   may   not   come under   the   category   of   hate   speech.   Therefore,   we   do   not   wish   to enlarge   the   scope   of   this   reference   by   going   into   the   questions which were answered in Amish Devgan. 137.   Therefore,  our answer to Question No.4 would be that a statement made by a Minister even if traceable to any affairs of   the   State   or   for   protecting   the   Government,   cannot   be attributed   vicariously   to   the   Government   by   invoking   the principle of collective responsibility. Question No.5 157 138.   Question No.5 referred to us for consideration is “whether a statement by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part­III of the Constitution, constitutes a violation of such constitutional rights and is actionable as ‘Constitutional Tort’?”  139.    To   begin   with,   we   have   some   difficulty   with   the   words “a   statement   by   a   Minister”,   appearing   in   Question   No.5. A statement may be made by a Minister either inside or outside the House of People/Legislative Assembly of the State. A statement may also   be   made   by   a   Minister   in   writing   or   by   words   spoken.   A statement may be made in private or in public. A statement may also be made by a Minister either touching upon the affairs of the Ministry/ department of which he is in control or touching generally upon   the   policies   of   the   Government   of   which   he   is   a   part.   A Minister may also make a statement, in the form of an opinion on matters about which he or his department is not concerned or over which he has no control.  All such statements need not necessarily give rise to an action in tort or in constitutional tort. 140.  Take for instance a case where a Minister makes a statement that women are unfit to be employed in a particular avocation. It 158 may reflect his insensitivity to gender equality and also may expose his low constitutional morality. The fact that due to his insensitivity or lack of understanding or low constitutional morality, he speaks a language that has the potential to demean the constitutional rights of   women,   cannot   be   a   ground   for   action   in   Constitutional   tort. Needless  to  say   that  no  one  can  either  be taxed  or  penalised for holding   an   opinion   which   is   not   in   conformity   with   the constitutional   values.   It   is   only   when   his   opinion   gets   translated into action and such action results in injury or harm or loss that an action in tort will lie. With this caveat, let us now get into the core of the issue.  141.  A tort is a civil wrong, that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm   resulting   in   legal   liability   for   the   person   who   commits   the tortious act. Halsbury’s Law of England states: “Those civil rights of action which are available for the recovery of unliquidated damages by persons who have sustained injury or loss from acts, statements or   omissions   of   others   in   breach   of   duty   or   contravention   of   right imposed or conferred by law rather than by agreement are rights of action in tort.” 159 142.  If Crown Proceedings Act, 1947 changed the course of the law relating   to   tort   in   England,   the   Federal   Tort   Claims   Act,   1946 changed in America, the course of law relating to the liability of the State for the tortious acts of its servants. Nevertheless, the claims for damages continued to be resisted for a long time both here and elsewhere on the principle of sovereign immunity. It is interesting to note that on the initiative of the President of India, the Law Ministry took up for consideration the question whether legislation on the lines of the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947 of the United Kingdom is needed and if so, to what extent.  After the constitution of the Law Commission,   the   Law   Ministry   referred   the   matter   to   the Commission   for   consideration   and   report.   In   its   First   Report submitted on 11.5.1956 on  “Liability of the State in Tort”, the Law Commission   took   note   of  (i)  the   existing   law   in   India;  (ii)  law   in England; (iii) law in America; (iv) law in Australia; (v) law in France; (vi)  rule   of   statutory   construction;   and  (vii)  conclusions   and proposals. 143.  In Chapter VIII containing the conclusions and proposals, the First   Report   of   the   Law   Commission   suggested:  (i)  that   in   the 160 context of a welfare State, it is necessary to establish a just relation between the rights of the individual and the responsibilities of the State;  (ii)  that when the Constitution was framed, the question to what extent, if any, the Union and the States should be made liable for the tortious acts of their servants or agents was left for future legislation;  (iii)  that   the   question   of   demarcating   the   line   up   to which the State should be made liable for the tortious acts, involves a nice balancing of considerations, so as not to unduly restrict the sphere of the activities of the State and at the same time to afford sufficient protection to the citizen; (iv)  that it is necessary that the law should, as far as possible, be made certain and definite, instead of leaving it to courts to develop the law according to the views of the judges; and  (v)  that the old distinction between sovereign and the   non­sovereign   functions   or   Governmental   and   the   non­ Governmental functions should no longer be invoked to determine the liability of the State. 144.    Paragraph   66   of   the   First   Report   of   the   Law   Commission contained   the   principles   on   which   appropriate   legislation   should proceed.  It will be useful to extract paragraph 66 of the First Report 161 of the Law Commission, to understand the sweep of constitutional tort, as it was conceived within a few years of the adoption of the Constitution.   In   fact,   it   has   laid   down  the   road   map   very   clearly with lot of foresight. Paragraph 66 reads thus: “66.   The   following   shall   be   the   principles   on   which legislation should proceed:— I. Under the general law: Under the general law of torts i.e., the English Common Law as imported into India on the principle of justice, equity and good conscience, with statutory modifications of that law now in force in India (vide the Principles of General Law, Appendix VI)— (i) The State as employer should be liable for   the   torts   committed   by   its   employees   and agents   while   acting   within   the   scope   of   their office or, employment. (ii) The State as employer should be liable in   respect   of   breach   of   those   duties   which   a person   owes   to   his   employees   or   agents   under the   general   law   by   reason   of   being   their employer. (iii)   The   State   should   be   liable   for   torts committed by an independent contractor only in cases referred to in Appendix VI. (iv) The State also should be liable for torts where a corporation owned or controlled by the State would be liable. (v) The State should be liable in respect of breach of duties attached under the general law to   the   ownership,   occupation,   possession   or control of immoveable properly from the moment 162 the   State   occupies   or   takes   possession   or assumes control of the property. (vi)   The   State   should   be   subject   to   the general   law   liability   for   injury   caused   by dangerous things (chattels). In respect of (i) to (vi) the State should be entitled to raise   the   same   defences,   which   a   citizen   would   be entitled to raise under general law. II. In respect of duties of care imposed by statute: (i) If a statute authorises the doing of an act which is in itself injurious, the State should not be liable. (ii)   The   State   should   be   liable,   without proof   of   negligence,   for   breach   of   a   statutory duty   imposed   on   it   or   its   employees   which causes damage. (iii)   The   State   should   be   liable   if   in   the discharge of statutory duties imposed upon it or its  employees, the employees  act  negligently  or maliciously, whether or not discretion is involved in the exercise of such duty. (iv)   The   State   should   be   liable   if   in   the exercise   of  the  powers  conferred  upon  it   or   its employees the power is so exercised as to cause nuisance  or  trespass  or  the  power   is  exercised negligently or maliciously causing damage. N.B.—Appendix V shows some of the Acts which contain protection clauses. But under the General   Clauses   Act   a   thing   is   deemed   to   be done in good faith even if it is done negligently. Therefore, by suitable legislation the protection should be made not to extend to negligent acts however honestly done and for this purpose the relevant clauses in such enactments should be examined. (v)   The   State   should   be   subject   to   the same duties and should have the same rights as 163 a private employer under a statute, whether it is specifically binding on the State or not. (vi)   If   an   Act   negatives   or   limits   the compensation payable to a citizen who suffered damage, coming within the scope of the Act, the liability   of   the   State   should   be   the   same   as under that Act and the injured person should be entitled   only   to   the   remedy,   if   any,   provided under the Act. III. Miscellaneous: Patents,  Designs and Copyrights:  The provisions of   Sec.   3   of   the   Crown   Proceedings   Act   may   be adopted. IV. General Provisions: (i)  Indemnity   and   contribution:   To   enable the State to claim indemnity or contribution, a provision   on   the   lines   of   Sec.   4   of   the   Crown Proceedings Act may be adopted. (ii)  Contributory   negligence:  In   England, the   Law   Reform   (Contributory   Negligence) Act,1945 was enacted amending the law relating to   contributory   negligence   and   in   view   of   the provisions of the Crown Proceedings Act the said Act also binds the Crown. In India, the trend of judicial opinion is in favour of holding that the rule in Merryweather v. Nixan [(1799) 8 T.R. 186] does   not   apply   and   that   there   is   no   legal impediment   to   one   tortfeasor   recovering compensation   from   another. But the law should not be left in an uncertain state and there should be legislation on the lines of the English Act. (iii) Appropriate provision should be made while revising the Civil Procedure Code to make it   obligatory   to   implead   as   party   to   a   suit   in which a claim for damages against the State is made,   the   employee,   agent   or   independent contractor for whose act the State is sought to 164 be   made   liable.     Any   claim   based on indemnity or contribution by the State may also   be   settled   in   such   proceeding   as   all   the parties will be before the court. V. Exceptions: (i)Acts   of   State:   The   defence   of   “Act   of State” should be made available to the State for any   act,   neglect   or   default   of   its   servants   or agents.     “Act   of   State”   means   an   act   of   the sovereign   power   directed   against   another sovereign   power   or   the   subjects   of   another sovereign   power   not   owning   temporary allegiance, in pursuance of sovereign rights. (ii)  Judicial   acts   and   execution   of   judicial process:The   State   shall   not   be   liable   for   acts done by judicial officers and persons executing warrants   and   orders   of   judicial   officers   in   all cases where protection is given to such officers and   persons   by   Sec.   1   of   the   Judicial   Officers Protection Act, 1850. (iii)  Acts   done   in   the   exercise   of   political functions of the State such as acts relating to: (a) Foreign Affairs (entry 10, List I, Seventh Schedule of the Constitution); (b)   Diplomatic,   Consular   and   trade representation (entry 11); (c)   United   Nations Organisation(entry 12); (d)Participation   in   international conferences, associations and other bodies and   implementing   of   decisions   made thereat (entry 13); (e) entering   into   treaties   and agreements   with   foreign   countries   and implementing of treaties, agreements and conventions   with   foreign   countries   (entry 14); (f)  war and peace (entry 15); 165 (g) foreign jurisdiction (entry 16); (h) anything   done   by   the President, Governor or Rajpramukh in the exercise of the following functions: Power   of   summoning,   proroguing and   dissolving   the   Legislature,   vetoing   of laws and anything done by the President in   the   exercise   of   the   powers   to   issue Proclamations under the Constitution; (i) Acts done under the Trading with the Enemy Act, 1947; (j) Acts done or omitted to be done under a Proclamation of Emergency when the security of the State is threatened. (iv) Acts done in relation to the Defence Forces: (a) Combatant   activities   of   the Armed Forces during the time of war; (b)  Acts   done   in   the   exercise   of the   powers   vested   in   the   Union   for   the purpose   of   training   or   maintaining   the efficiency of the Defence Forces; The   statutes   relating   to   these already   provide   for   payment   of compensation   and   the   machinery   for determining   the   compensation:  See Manoeuvres,   Field   Firing   and   Artillery Practice   Act,   1948;   Seaward   Artillery Practice Act, 1949; (c)   The   liability   of   the   State   for personal   injury   or   death   caused   by   a member   of   the   Armed   Forces   to   another member while on duty shall be restricted in the  same  manner  as in  England  (Sec. 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act) (v) Miscellaneous: 166 (a)   any   claim   arising   out   of defamation,   malicious   prosecution   and malicious arrest, (b)   any   claim   arising   out   of   the operation of quarantine law, (c)   existing   immunity   under   the Indian   Telegraph   Act,   1885   and   Indian Post Offices Act, 1898, (d)   foreign   torts.   (The   English provision may be adopted.)” 145.    It   appears   that   based   on   the   First   Report   of   the   Law Commission, a Bill known as the Government (Liability in Torts) Bill was introduced in 1967, but the same did not become the law. As a consequence, a huge burden was cast on the Courts to develop the law through judicial precedents, some of which we shall see now. 146.   The judicial journey actually started off on a right note with the decision in  The  State of  Bihar  vs.  Abdul Majid112, where a Government servant who was dismissed but later reinstated, filed a suit   for   recovery   of   arrears   of   salary.   Though   the   State   raised   a defence on the basis of the doctrine of pleasure, this Court rejected the   same   on   the   ground   that   said   doctrine   based   on   the   Latin 112  AIR 1954 SC 245 167 phrase “durante bene placito” (during pleasure) has no application in India. This decision was followed in State of Rajasthan vs. Mst. Vidhyawati113,  which   involved   a   claim   for   compensation   by   the widow of a person who was fatally knocked down by a jeep owned and   maintained   by   the   State.   When   sovereign   immunity   was pleaded,   this   Court   observed   in  Vidhyawati  (supra):  “when   the rule   of   immunity  in   favour  of  the   Crown,   based   on  common law in the United Kingdom has disappeared from the land of its birth, there is no legal warrant for holding that it has any validity in this country, particularly after the Constitution.” 147.   On the question of the liability of the State, for the tortious acts of its servants, this Court opined in Vidhyawati, as follows: “(10) This case also meets the second branch of the argument   that   the   State   cannot   be   liable   for   the tortious acts of its servants, when such servants are engaged on an activity connected with the affairs of the State. In this connection it has to be remembered that under the Constitution we have established a welfare state,   whose   functions   are   not   confined   only   to maintaining law and order, but extend to engaging in all activities including industry, public transport, state trading, to name only a few of them. …” 113 AIR 1962 SC 933 168 148.    But   despite   the   decisions   in  Abdul   Majid  (supra)  and Vidhyawati, this Court fell into a slippery slope in Kasturi Lal. It was a case where the partner of a firm dealing in bullion and other goods was arrested and detained in police custody and the gold and silver that he was carrying was seized by the police. When he was released later, the silver was returned but the Head Constable who effected   the   arrest   misappropriated   the   gold   and   fled   away   to Pakistan   in   October,   1947.   The   suit   filed   by  Kasturi   Lal  for recovery of the value of the gold, was resisted on the ground that this was not a case of negligence of the servants of the State and that even if negligence was held proved against the police officers the State could not be held liable. While upholding the contention of the State, this Court said “if a tortious act is committed by a public servant and it gives rise to a claim for damages, the question to ask is: was the tortious act committed by the public servant in discharge of statutory functions which are referable to, and ultimately based on, the delegation of the sovereign powers of the State to such public servant? If the answer is in the affirmative, the action for damages for loss caused by such tortious act will not lie.  On the other hand, if 169 the tortious act has been committed by a public servant in discharge of   duties   assigned   to   him   not   by   virtue   of   the   delegation   of   any sovereign   power,   an   action   for   damages   would   lie.  The   act   of   the public servant committed by him during the course of his employment is in this category of cases, an act of a servant who might have been employed by a private individual for the same purpose.” 149.    In fact, it was suggested by this Court in  Kasturi Lal  that the   Legislatures   in   India   should   seriously   consider   making legislative   enactments   to   regulate   and   control   their   claim   for immunity.   Before   proceeding   further   with   the   journey   in   the chronological sequence, it must be mentioned that the decision in Kasturi Lal was diluted to some extent after nearly 30 years which we shall take note of at the appropriate stage. 150.    In  Khatri   (II)  vs.  State   of   Bihar.114,   which   came   to   be popularly known as Bhagalpur blinding case, this Court was dealing with a brutal incident of Police atrocity which resulted in twenty­ four prisoners being blinded. Though an opportunity was provided 114 (1981) 1 SCC 627 170 to this Court to signal the arrival of Constitutional tort in the said case   and   though   the   petitioners   sought   compensation   for   the violation of their Article 21 right, this Court simply postponed the decision   to   a   future   date   by   holding   that   they   are   issues   of   the gravest Constitutional importance, involving the exploration of new dimension of the right to life and personal liberty. 151.   But within a couple of years, another opportunity arose in Rudul  Sah  (supra), which  related to  the  unlawful  detention  of a prisoner for fourteen years even after his acquittal. This shook the conscience   of   this   Court.   Therefore,   this   Court   awarded compensation in an arbitrary sum of money, even while reserving the right of the petitioner to bring a suit for recovery of appropriate damages. This Court said that the order of compensation passed by this Court was in the nature of palliative. When it is suggested by the State that the appropriate remedy would be only to file a suit for damages,   this   Court   said   that   by   refusing   to   order   anything (towards compensation), this Court would be doing mere lip­service to the fundamental right to liberty and that one of the telling ways 171 in which the violation of the right by the State can be reasonably prevented, is to mulct its violators with monetary compensation. 152.    After  Rudul   Sah,   there   was   no   looking   back.     Instead   of providing elaborate details, we think it is sufficient to provide in a tabular   form,   details   of   the   cases   where   this   Court   awarded compensation in public law, invoking the principle of constitutional tort, either expressly or impliedly.  Sr.  No. Case Laws Decision 1.

(2011) 14 SCC 481  A fire in a cinema hall resulted in injury to   over   100   persons   and   death   of   59 cinemagoers.   The   fire   was   caused   by   a   transformer installed by Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB).  HC had found the Municipal Corporation, Delhi Police, and the DVB responsible for the accident.  This   Court   held   only   DVB   and   theatre owner liable to pay compensation in the ratio of 15:85.  While   doing   so,   this   Court   dealt extensively   with   the   concept   of Constitutional Tort. 153.   It will be clear from the decisions listed in the Table above that   this   Court   and   the   High   Courts   have   been   consistent   in invoking   Constitutional   tort   whenever   an   act   of   omission   and commission   on   the   part   of   a   public   functionary,   including   a Minister, caused harm  or  loss. But as rightly  pointed out  by  the learned   Attorney   General   in   his   note,   the   matter   pre­eminently 175 deserves   a   proper   legal   framework   so   that   the   principles   and procedure are coherently set out without leaving the matter open ended or vague. In fact, the First Report of the Law Commission submitted a draft bill way back in 1956. This Court recommended a legislative   measure   in  Kasturi   Lal  in   1965   and   a   bill   called Government   (Liability   in   Torts)   Bill  was   introduced   in   1967.   But nothing   happened   in   the   past   55   years.   In   such   circumstances, courts   cannot   turn   a   blind   eye   but   may   have   to   imaginatively fashion the remedy to be provided to persons who suffer injury or loss,   without   turning   them   away   on   the   ground   that   there   is   no proper legal frame work.     154.  Therefore, our answer to Question No. 5 is as follows: “A mere statement made by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part­III of the Constitution, may not constitute a violation of the constitutional rights and become actionable as Constitutional tort. But if as a consequence of such a statement, any act of omission or commission is done 176 by the officers resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, then the same may be actionable as a constitutional tort”. SUMMING UP 155.   To sum up, our answers to the five questions referred to the Bench, are as follows: QUESTIONS ANSWERS 1. Are   the   grounds   specified   in Article   19(2)   in   relation   to which   reasonable   restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed by law, exhaustive, or can restrictions on the right to   free   speech   be   imposed   on grounds   not   found   in   Article 19(2)   by   invoking   other fundamental rights? The   grounds   lined   up   in Article   19(2)   for   restricting the   right   to   free   speech   are exhaustive.   Under   the   guise of   invoking   other fundamental   rights   or   under the guise of two fundamental rights   staking   a   competing claim   against   each   other, additional   restrictions   not found in Article 19(2), cannot be imposed on the exercise of the right conferred by Article 19(1)(a) upon any individual. 2. Can a fundamental right under Article   19   or   21   of   the Constitution   of   India   be claimed other than against the ‘State’ or its instrumentalities? A   fundamental   right   under Article 19/21 can be enforced even   against   persons   other than   the   State   or   its instrumentalities. 3. Whether   the   State   is   under   a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India The   State   is   under   a   duty   to affirmatively protect the rights of   a   person   under   Article   21, 177 even   against   a   threat   to   the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another citizen or private agency? whenever   there   is   a   threat   to personal   liberty,   even   by   a non­State actor. 4. Can   a   statement   made   by   a Minister,   traceable   to   any affairs of State or for protecting the Government, be attributed vicariously   to   the   Government itself, especially  in view of the principle   of   Collective Responsibility?  A   statement   made   by   a Minister   even   if   traceable   to any affairs of the State or for protecting   the   Government, cannot   be   attributed vicariously to the Government by   invoking   the   principle   of collective responsibility. 5. Whether   a   statement   by   a Minister, inconsistent with the rights   of   a   citizen   under   Part Three   of   the   Constitution, constitutes a violation of such constitutional   rights   and   is actionable   as   ‘Constitutional Tort”? A mere statement made by  a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part­ III   of   the   Constitution,   may not   constitute   a   violation   of the   constitutional   rights   and become   actionable   as Constitutional tort. But if as a consequence   of   such   a statement, any act of omission or commission is done by the officers   resulting   in   harm   or loss to a person/citizen, then the   same   may   be   actionable as a constitutional tort. 178 156.   Now that we have answered the questions, the writ petition and  the special leave petition  are directed to be listed before the appropriate   bench   after   getting   orders   from   Hon’ble   the   Chief Justice of India. …..…………....................J.     (S. Abdul Nazeer) …..…………....................J.     (B.R. Gavai) …..…………....................J.     (A.S. Bopanna) .…..………......................J.

Conclusions 120-121 2 J U D G M E N T NAGARATHNA, J. I have had the benefit of reading the erudite judgment proposed by His Lordship V. Ramasubramanian, J. While I agree with the reasoning and conclusions arrived at by his Lordship on certain questions referred to this Constitution Bench, I wish to lend a different perspective to some of the issues by way of my separate opinion. 2. In the words of one of the Indian philosophers, Basaveshwara: “NuDidare muttina haaradantirabeku, NuDidare maanikyada deeptiyantirabeku, NuDidare spatikada shalaakeyantirabeku, NuDidare Lingamecchi ahudenabeku.” One should speak only when the words uttered are as pure as pearls strung on a thread; Like the lustre shed by a ruby; Like a crystal’s flash that cleaves the blue; And such that the Lord, on listening to such speech, must say “yes, yes, that is true!” Introduction: 3. The concern of the petitioners in these cases is the misuse of the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, particularly, by those persons holding political offices, public servants, public functionaries or others holding responsible positions in Indian polity and society. The concern of the petitioners is with regard to the manner in which public functionaries make disparaging and insulting remarks against certain sections of the 3 society, against countrymen and against certain individuals such as women who may be victims of crime. Such indiscreet speech is a cause of concern in recent times as it is thought to be hurtful and insulting. The questions raised in these matters are with regard to remedies available in law so as to counter such kind of hurtful or disparaging speech made, particularly, by public functionaries. 4. The facts giving rise to the present petitions may be encapsulated as under: 4.1. Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 113 of 2016, relates to the unsavory public comments made by a former Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Minister, in the context of an alleged gang rape of a woman and her minor daughter that took place on 29th July, 2016 on the Noida- Shahjahanpur National Highway (NH 91). Relying on certain news articles, the petitioner in Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 113 of 2016 has brought to the notice of this Court the remarks made by the said public functionary, terming the alleged incident as an “opposition conspiracy,” which was proliferated merely because “elections were near, and the desperate opposition could stoop to any level to defame the government.” 4.2. In relation to such statements, a First Information Report, being FIR No. 0838 of 2016 was registered against the said Minister on 30th July, 2016 by the Kotwali Police Station, Dehat, 4 Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, for offences under Sections 395, 397, 376-D, 342 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as ‘IPC’ for the sake of convenience). 4.3. In the above background, the Writ Petition has been preferred, praying as follows: “P R A Y E R : - In view of the above stated submissions, it is therefore, most humbly prayed that this Hon’ble Court; may in the interests of justice, be pleased to :- a. Issue a writ of mandamus and / or any other appropriate writ and / or direction against the respondents directing them to stop the infringement of the fundamental rights of the petitioner to live a lawful life; in addition to passing other appropriate directions to the respondents. b. Direct the state to pay the appropriate compensation to the petitioner, other victims and the family members as per Law. c. Direct the state to provide and ensure respectable and appropriate free of cost and safe education arrangements till the attainments of the highest degree in the interest of justice. d. Direct the state to provide and ensure sufficient life security and appropriate job security to the petitioner, other victims and family members. e. Summon the status report from the investigation agency in the interests of justice. f. Monitor the investigation of FIR No.0838/2016 under Section 154 Cr. P.C. 395, 397, 376-D and POCSO Act, 342. g. Transfer the trial of the FIR No.0838/2016 to Delhi from Bulandshahar in the interest of justice. h. Pass directions to Respondent No.1 to register F.I.R. against Sh. Azam Khan, Minister for Urban Development, Govt. of UP; for making statements being outrageous to the modesty of the petitioner in the matters of the present case. i. Direct to the Respondent No.1 for registration of F.I.R. No.0838/2016 against erring police officials for disobeying the directions of law in the present case. 5 j. Pass any other or further orders as this Hon’ble Court may deem fit and proper in the light of the facts and circumstances of the present case in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents.” 4.4. Special Leave Petition bearing Diary No. 34629 of 2017 has been filed impugning the common order dated 31st May, 2017 passed by the High Court of Kerala, at Ernakulam dismissing Writ Petition (C) No. 15869 and Writ Petition (C) No. 14712 of 2017. The said Writ Petitions were filed before the High Court alleging inaction on the part of Government of Kerala in connection with the derogatory statements made on separate occasions, by the then Minister of Electricity, Government of Kerala, against a woman Principal of a polytechnic college in Kerala, the mother of a student who allegedly committed suicide due to the alleged harassment by the college authorities and against women labourers of a tea plantation. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the said Writ Petition, SLP bearing Diary No. 34629 of 2017 came to be filed before this Court, which was directed to be tagged with Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 113 of 2016. 5. The questions raised for the consideration of this Constitution Bench are enumerated as under: “1) Are the grounds specified in Article 19(2) in relation to which reasonable restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed by law, exhaustive, or can restrictions on the right to free speech be imposed on grounds not found in 6 Article 19(2) by invoking other fundamental rights? 2) Can a fundamental right under Article 19 or 21 of the Constitution of India be claimed other than against the ‘State’ or its instrumentalities? 3) Whether the State is under a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India even against a threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another citizen or private agency? 4) Can a statement made by a Minister, traceable to any affairs of State or for protecting the Government, be attributed vicariously to the Government itself, especially in view of the principle of Collective Responsibility? 5) Whether a statement by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part Three of the Constitution, constitutes a violation of such constitutional rights and is actionable as ‘Constitutional Tort’?” 6. His Lordship, Ramsubramanian, J. has answered the questions referred to this Constitution Bench in the scholarly judgment proposed by him. My view on each of such questions, as contrasted with those of His Lordship’s have been expressed in a tabular form hereinunder, for easy reference. Questions His Lordship’s views My views 1) Are the grounds specified in Article 19(2) in relation to which reasonable restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed by law, exhaustive, or can restrictions on the The grounds lined up in Article 19(2) for restricting the right to free speech are exhaustive. Under the guise of invoking other fundamental rights or under the guise of two I respectfully agree with the reasoning and conclusion of His Lordship, in so far as Question No. 1 is concerned. 7 Questions His Lordship’s views My views right to free speech be imposed on grounds not found in Article 19(2) by invoking other fundamental rights? fundamental rights taking a competing claim against each other, additional restrictions not found in Article 19(2), cannot be imposed on the exercise of the right conferred by Article 19(1)(a) upon any individual. 2) Can a fundamental right under Article 19 or 21 of the Constitution of India be claimed other than against the ‘State’ or its instrumentalities? A fundamental right under Article 19/21 can be enforced even against persons other than the State or its instrumentalities. The rights in the realm of common law, which may be similar in their content to the Fundamental Rights under Article 19/21, operate horizontally; However, the Fundamental Rights under Articles 19 and 21, do not except those rights which have also been statutorily recognised. Therefore, a fundamental right under Article 19/21 cannot be enforced against persons other than the State or its instrumentalities. However, they may be the basis for seeking common law remedies. But a remedy in the form of writ of Habeas Corpus, if sought against a private person on the basis of Article 21 of the Constitution 8 Questions His Lordship’s views My views can be before a Constitutional Court i.e., by way of Article 226 before the High Court or Article 32 read with Article 142 before the Supreme Court. As far as non-State entities or those entities which do not fall within the scope of Article 12 of the Constitution are concerned, a writ petition to enforce fundamental rights would not be entertained as against them. This is primarily because such matters would involve disputed questions of fact. 3) Whether the State is under a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India even against a threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another citizen or private agency? The State is under a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a person under Article 21, whenever there is a threat to personal liberty even by a private actor. The duty cast upon the State under Article 21 is a negative duty not to deprive a person of his life and personal liberty except in accordance with law. The State however has an affirmative duty to carry out obligations cast upon it under constitutional and statutory law. Such obligations may require interference by the State where acts of a private party may threaten the life or liberty of another individual. Hence, failure to carry out the duties enjoined upon 9 Questions His Lordship’s views My views the State under constitutional and statutory law to protect the rights of a citizen, could have the effect of depriving a citizen of his right to life and personal liberty. When a citizen is so deprived of his right to life and personal liberty, the State would have breached the negative duty cast upon it under Article 21. 4) Can a statement made by a Minister, traceable to any affairs of State or for protecting the Government, be attributed vicariously to the Government itself, especially in view of the principle of Collective Responsibility? A statement made by a Minister even if traceable to any affairs of the State or for protecting the Government, cannot be attributed vicariously to the Government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility. A statement made by a Minister if traceable to any affairs of the State or for protecting the Government, can be attributed vicariously to the Government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility, so long as such statement represents the view of the Government also. If such a statement is not consistent with the view of the Government, then it is attributable to the Minister personally. 5) Whether a statement by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part Three of the Constitution, constitutes a violation A mere statement made by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part-III of the Constitution, may not constitute a A proper legal framework is necessary to define the acts or omissions which would amount to constitutional torts, and the manner in which the same would be redressed 10 Questions His Lordship’s views My views of such constitutional rights and is actionable as ‘Constitutional Tort’ violation of constitutional rights and become actionable as a Constitutional tort. But if as a consequence of such a statement, any act of omission or commission is done by the officers resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, then the same may be actionable as a constitutional tort. or remedied on the basis of judicial precedent. It is not prudent to treat all cases where a statement made by a public functionary resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, as constitutional torts. Public functionaries could be proceeded against personally if their statement is inconsistent with the views of the Government. If, however, such views are consistent with the views of the Government, or are endorsed by the Government, then the same may be vicariously attributed to the State on the basis of the principle of collective responsibility and appropriate remedies may be sought before a court of law. Submissions: 7. We have heard learned Senior Counsel, Sri Kaleeswaram Raj, for the Petitioners and learned Attorney General for the Respondents, and learned Senior Counsel Ms. Aparajita Singh, amicus curiae. 11 Arguments on behalf of the petitioners: 8. The submissions of learned Senior Counsel, Sri Kaleeswaram Raj, appearing on behalf of the Petitioners may be epitomized as under: 8.1. That while upholding the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression of Ministers, efforts should be made to frame a voluntary code of conduct for Ministers and public officials, which would ensure better accountability and transparency in their political activities and also place a check on the misuse of freedom of speech and expression exercised by public functionaries using the apparatus of the State. 8.2. That while the state’s duty to protect life and liberty broadly falls within the right under Article 21, it is difficult to chain the State with responsibility in every instance where speech by a public functionary strikes at the dignity of another person. That in the absence of such a provision to vicariously attribute responsibility to the State, every instance of such speech cannot be actionable and remediable through the judiciary. That no duty corresponding to Article 21 is imposed on individual Ministers nor such duty is imposed on any government machinery to regulate the conduct of individual Ministers warranting judicial intervention. Therefore, even though no actionable breach of public duty can be said to have taken place when statements are 12 made by people in power, this in turn, postulates the desirability to have a voluntary code of conduct in the better interest of the government as well as the governed. 8.3. Reliance was placed on Article 75 (3) of the Constitution to contend that Ministers have a collective responsibility towards the legislature and thus, a code of conduct to self-regulate the speech and actions of Ministers is constitutionally justifiable. That a Minister is not supposed to breach her/his collective responsibility towards the Cabinet and the Legislature, hence, it is advisable to have a cogent code of conduct as available in advanced democracies. 8.4. Learned Senior Counsel lastly submitted that the instant cases do not involve a question as to conflict of any other right with Article 19. That the question herein, in sum and substance, is, whether, any restraint justifiable under the Constitution, can be placed on Ministers and public functionaries, to regulate their speech. Arguments on behalf of the Respondent-Union of India: 9. Submissions of Learned Attorney General for India, Sri R. Venkataramani and Learned Solicitor General of India, Sri Tushar Mehta, appearing on behalf of the Respondent-Union of India, may be summarized as under: 13 9.1. At the outset, Sri R. Venkataramani, Learned Attorney General fairly submitted that restrictions on the freedom of speech enumerated under Article 19 (2) have to be taken to be exhaustive and thus, the court cannot invoke any other fundamental right, namely, Article 21 to impose restrictions on grounds which are not enumerated under Article 19(2). Further, that as a matter of constitutional principle, any addition, alteration or change in the norms or criteria for imposition of restrictions, on any fundamental right has to come through a legislative process. That the balancing of fundamental rights, either to avoid overlapping or to ensure mutual enjoyment, is different from treating one right as a restriction on another right. 9.2. It was next submitted that the Constitution of India sets out the scheme of claims of fundamental rights against the State or its instrumentalities and such scheme also addresses breaches or violations of fundamental rights by persons other than the State or its instrumentalities. Thus, any proposition to add or insert subjects or matters in respect of which claims can be made against persons other than the State, would amount to a constitutional change. That any enlargement of such constitutional principles would have the consequence of opening a flood gate of constitutional litigation. 14 9.3. It was further contended that there are sufficient constitutional and legal remedies available to a citizen whose liberty is threatened by any person and beyond the constitutional and legal remedies, there may not be any other additional duty to affirmatively protect the right of a citizen under Article 21. 9.4. Learned Attorney General urged that Ministerial misdemeanors, which have nothing to do with the discharge of public duty and are not traceable to the affairs of the State will have to be treated as acts of individual violation and individual wrongs. Thus, the state cannot be vicariously liable for the same. That the conduct of a public servant like a Minister in the government, if was traceable to the discharge of a public duty or duties of the office, was subject to the scrutiny of law. However, such misconduct including statements that may be made by a Minister, cannot be linked to the principles of collective responsibility. Submissions of learned amicus curiae, Ms. Aparajita Singh, Senior Advocate: 10. The submissions of learned amicus curiae, Ms. Aparajita Singh, may be summarized as under: 10.1. At the outset she submitted that the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) is subject to clearly defined restrictions under Article 19(2). Therefore, any law seeking to 15 limit the right under Article 19(1)(a) has to fall within the limitation provided under Article 19(2). 10.2. That the right to freedom of speech and expression of a public functionary who represents the state has to be balanced with a citizen’s right to fair investigation under Article 21 and if the exercise of a Minister’s right under Article 19(1)(a) violates a citizen’s right under Article 21 then the same would have to be read down to protect the right of the citizen. Thus, a Minister cannot claim the protection of Article 19(1)(a) to violate Article 21 rights of citizens. 10.3. Ms. Aparajita Singh next contended that a Minister, being a functionary of the State represents the State when acting in his official capacity. Therefore, any violation of the fundamental rights of citizens by the Minister in his official capacity, would be attributable to the State. Thus, it would be preposterous to suggest that while the State is under an obligation to restrict a private citizen from violating the fundamental rights of other citizens, its own Minister can do so with impunity. However, learned amicus curiae qualified such submission by stating that the factum of violation would need to be established on the facts of a given case and hence the law has to evolve from case to case. It would involve a detailed inquiry into questions such as i) whether the statement by the Minister was made in his personal 16 or official capacity; ii) whether the statement was made on a public or private issue; iii) whether the statement was made on a public or private platform. 10.4. It was submitted that a Minister is personally bound by the oath of office to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India under Articles 75(4) and 164(3) of the Constitution. That the code of conduct for Ministers (both for Union and States) specifically lays down that the Code is in addition to the “…observance of the provisions of the Constitution, the Representation of the People Act, 1951”. Therefore, a constitutional functionary is duty bound to act in a manner which is in consonance with the constitutional obligations. 10.5. It was lastly submitted that the State acts through its functionaries. Therefore, an official act of a Minister which violates the fundamental rights of the citizens, would make the State liable by treating the said act of the Minister as a constitutional tort. However, the principle of sovereign immunity of the state for the tortious acts of its servants, has been held to be inapplicable in the case of violation of fundamental rights. Question No. 1 referred to this Constitution Bench reads as under: “Are the grounds specified in Article 19(2) in relation to which reasonable restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed 17 by law, exhaustive, or can restrictions on the right to free speech be imposed on grounds not found in Article 19(2) by invoking fundamental rights?” Preface: 11. In my view, these cases call for an analysis of the content of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India which grants to all citizens of India the right to freedom of speech and expression. Before proceeding to analyse the relevant constitutional provisions, it may be appropriate to preface the discussion with the thought that freedom of speech is not contingent only upon the laws of a nation. The compulsion of social relations and the informal pressures of conformity, exerted in a pervasive manner, determine to a great extent, the content and limits of permissible speech in society. It is the laws, however, through their own unique methods, which reinforce social sanctions. Therefore, the Constitution, which is the fundamental law of the land, as well as the other laws which are measured on the touchstone of the Constitution, are to be interpreted, having regard, inter-alia, to the content and permissible limits of free speech in a peaceful society. It is necessary to observe that freedom of speech and expression has always been closely linked with certain socio-political ideals that constitute the foundation of democracy: respect for individual dignity and equality; fraternity; ideals of tolerance; cultural and religious sensitivity. Many of these ideals are written into the text of our 18 Constitution and permeate its structure through the very Preamble to the Constitution. These ideals form the philosophical foundations of the discourse on free speech and therefore, any analysis of the same should be compatible with these ideals. It is in that background that one must set out to examine whether additional accountability and thus, a legal obligation can be cast upon public functionaries with respect to the permissible extent of free speech. Further, it is also necessary to examine the difference between restraints on the exercise of freedom of speech and expression, vis-à-vis restrictions thereon, and in that background examine the degree of self-restraint that needs to be exercised by every citizen, whether a public functionary or not, in exercising his/her right to freedom of speech and expression in a Country like ours which is so unique because of its diversity and pluralism. Article 19(1)(a) and Article 19(2): An overview 12. At this stage, it would be useful to dilate on Article 19(1)(a) and Article 19(2) as under: 12.1. Article 19(1)(a) to (f) of the Constitution guarantees certain fundamental rights to the citizens of India. These fundamental rights are however, subject to reasonable restrictions as enumerated in Articles 19(2) to (6) thereof which could be imposed by the State. These fundamental rights are in the nature of inalienable rights of man or basic human rights which inhere 19 in all citizens of a free country. Yet, these rights are not unrestricted or absolute, and are regulated by restrictions, which may be imposed by the State, which have to be reasonable. The object of prescribing restraints or reasonable restrictions on the fundamental freedoms is to avoid anarchy or disorder in society. Hence, the founding fathers of our Constitution while enumerating the fundamental rights, have alongside prescribed reasonable restrictions in clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 and the laws enacted within the strict limits of such restrictions are constitutionally permissible. 12.2. Since, these cases involve the freedom of speech and expression, it is unnecessary to analyse the nature of the other fundamental rights in Article 19(1) of the Constitution. Articles 19(1) (a) and 19(2) of the Constitution read as under: “19. Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc.- (1) All citizens shall have the right – (a) to freedom of speech and expression; xxx xxx xxx (2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (a) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law, in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub- clause in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with Foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.” 20 12.3. The freedom of speech and expression as envisaged under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution means the right to free speech and to express opinions through various media such as by word of mouth, through the print or electronic media, through pictographs, writings, graphics or any other manner that can be discerned by the mind. The right includes the freedom of press. The content of this right also includes propagation of ideas through publication and circulation, the right to seek information and to acquire or impart ideas. In short, the right to free speech would include every nature of right that would come within the scope and ambit of free speech. Hence, Article 19(1)(a) in very broad and in wide terms states that all citizens shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression. The said right can be curtailed only by reasonable restrictions which are enumerated in Article 19(2) thereof which can be imposed by the State under the authority of law but not by exercise of executive power in the absence of any law. Further, the nature of restrictions on right to free speech must be reasonable, and in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. (Article 19(2)). 12.4. For a country like ours which is a Parliamentary Democracy, freedom of speech and expression is a necessary right as well as 21 a concomitant for the purpose of not only ensuring a healthy democracy but also to ensure that the citizens could be well informed and educated on governance. The dissemination of information through various media, including print and electronic media or audio visual form, is to ensure that the citizens are enlightened about their rights and duties, the manner in which they should conduct themselves in a democracy and for enabling a debate on the policies and actions of the Governments and ultimately for the development of the Indian society in an egalitarian way. 12.5. The right to freedom of speech and expression in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution has its genesis in the Preamble of the Constitution which, inter alia, speaks of liberty of thought, expression, belief. Since, India is a sovereign democratic republic and we follow a parliamentary system of democracy, liberty of thought and expression is a significant freedom and right under our constitutional setup. 12.6. This Court has, since the enforcement of the Constitution, been zealously upholding the right to freedom of speech and expression in innumerable judgments which may be highlighted with reference to a few of them. i) In Romesh Thappar vs. State of Madras, AIR 1950 SC 124, 1950 SCC 436, (“Romesh Thappar”) while highlighting that the freedom of speech is the foundation of 22 all democratic organisations, held that said freedom would also include the right to freedom of the press. This judgment highlighted that the free flow of opinion and ideas is necessary to sustain collective life of the well informed citizenry which is a sine qua non for effective governance. ii) In S. Khushboo vs. Kanniammal, (2010) 5 SCC 600, (“Khushboo”) this Court held that the freedom under Article 19(1)(a) envisaged dissemination of all kinds of views, both popular as well as unpopular. iii) Recently in Shreya Singhal vs. Union of India, (2015) 5 SCC 1, (“Shreya Singhal”) this Court speaking through Nariman, J. highlighted on the differences between the US First Amendment and Article 19(1)(a) read with Article 19(2) in the following words: “15. It is significant to notice first the differences between the US First Amendment and Article 19(1)(a) read with Article 19(2). The first important difference is the absoluteness of the US First Amendment—Congress shall make no law which abridges the freedom of speech. Second, whereas the US First Amendment speaks of freedom of speech and of the press, without any reference to “expression”, Article 19(1)(a) speaks of freedom of speech and expression without any reference to “the press”. Third, under the US Constitution, speech may be abridged, whereas under our Constitution, reasonable restrictions may be imposed. Fourth, under our Constitution such restrictions have to be in the interest of eight designated subject-matters— that is, any law seeking to impose a restriction on the freedom of speech can only pass muster if it is proximately related to any of the eight subject- matters set out in Article 19(2).” 23 It was further observed that insofar as the first apparent difference is concerned, the United States Supreme Court has never given effect to the declaration that Congress shall, under some circumstances, make any law abridging the freedom of speech. Insofar as the second apparent difference is concerned, para 17 of Shreya Singhal is extracted as under: “17. So far as the second apparent difference is concerned, the American Supreme Court has included “expression” as part of freedom of speech and this Court has included “the press” as being covered under Article 19(1)(a), so that, as a matter of judicial interpretation, both the US and India protect the freedom of speech and expression as well as press freedom. Insofar as abridgement and reasonable restrictions are concerned, both the US Supreme Court and this Court have held that a restriction in order to be reasonable must be narrowly tailored or narrowly interpreted so as to abridge or restrict only what is absolutely necessary. It is only when it comes to the eight subject-matters that there is a vast difference. In the US, if there is a compelling necessity to achieve an important governmental or societal goal, a law abridging freedom of speech may pass muster. But in India, such law cannot pass muster if it is in the interest of the general public. Such law has to be covered by one of the eight subject-matters set out under Article 19(2). If it does not, and is outside the pale of Article 19(2), Indian courts will strike down such law.” In Shreya Singhal, there was a challenge to Section 66-A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which was struck down as being violative of Article 19(1)(a) and was not saved under 24 Article 19(2) on the ground of vagueness and not providing manageable standards and clear guidance for citizens, authorities and courts for drawing a precise line between allowable and forbidden speech, expression or information. When a law uses vague expressions capable of misuse or abuse without providing notice to persons of common intelligence to guess their meaning, it leaves them in a boundless sea of uncertainty, conferring wide, unfettered powers on authorities to curtail freedom of speech and expression arbitrarily. 12.7. The present cases, however, are not really concerned with restrictions on the right to freedom of speech being imposed by the State. These cases are concerned with the content of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, inasmuch as the grievance sought to be ventilated by the petitioners is, whether, there could be an inherent constitutional restriction on freedom of speech and expression on the citizens vis-à-vis other citizens. These cases are not with regard to reasonable restrictions that could be imposed by the State on the freedom of speech and expression, rather, what would be the content of free speech that should not be exercised as a right by an individual citizen which would not in any way give rise to a cause of action to another citizen to seek a remedy. 25 13. The content of a free speech right, as described hereinabove, is to be understood in terms of the structural elements or components of a free speech right. Only when a free speech right is understood as such, deductions can be made as to the precise boundaries thereof and the basis on which such right can be limited or restrained. Stephen Gradbaum, in his essay titled “The Structure of a Free Speech Right,” in the Oxford Handbook of Freedom of Speech has discussed six components of a free speech right, in the following words: “The first is the 'force' of a free speech right. This includes what type of legal right to free speech is formally recognized or at issue: for example, common law, statutory, or constitutional. This in turn helps to determine whether and how easily a free speech right can be legally superseded. Another aspect of force is whether and how the right is judicially enforceable. The second component is the 'subject' of free speech rights, or who are the rights-holders: for example, all persons within a jurisdiction or only citizens; legal persons including corporations or only natural persons? The third is the ‘scope’ of a free speech right: a right to say or do what exactly? Does it include falsehoods, hate speech, or baking a cake? The fourth, as a distinct structural element concerning content, addresses whether the right includes not only negative prohibitions on relevant others but also positive obligations, such as a duty to affirmatively protect the free speech of rights-holders from third-party threats? The fifth component is the 'object' of a free speech right: who are these 'relevant others' that are bound by the holder's rights? Against whom can the right be validly asserted? Finally, there is the 'limitation’ of a free speech right. If the prior questions have all been answered to the effect that a free speech right is implicated and infringed in a particular situation, when, if ever, might there be a legally justified limitation of that right? Is the right an absolute bar or ‘trump’ against inconsistent action and, if not, what presumptive weight attaches to it? How, when, and why can the presumption be rebutted? Collectively, by constituting and expressing 26 the underlying structure of the right to free speech, the answers to these six questions help to define the nature and extent of any particular such right in a given legal system.” (Emphasis by me) Referring to the aspect of limitation of a free speech right, the learned author has observed that the teleology of a Constitutional order, can also play a role in fashioning the contours of free speech protections. That is to say, a free speech right may be fashioned to serve Constitutional commitments. 14. According to Wesley Hohfeld’s analysis of the form of rights, every right has a complex internal structure, and such structure determines what the rights mean for those who hold them. Such rights are ordered arrangements of basic components. One of the components of a right, is a correlative duty. That is to say, if X has a right, he is legally protected from interference in respect of such right and such right carries with it the duty of the State, not to interfere with such right. If the State (or any other person) is under no corelative duty to abstain from interfering with the exercise of a right, then such a right is not a ‘right’ in the strict Hohfeldian sense. The boundaries of the protective perimeter within which a person can exercise their rights, depend on the degree to which the State is duty bound to protect the right. 14.1. What emerges from the Hohfeldian conception of rights and corelative duties, qua the right to freedom of speech and expression may be summed up as follows: 27 a) The Constitution of India confers under Article 19(1)(a), the right to freedom of speech and expression to all its citizens. The State has a corelative duty to abstain from interference with such right except as provided in Article 19(2) of the Consitution which are reasonable restrictions on the right conferred under Article 19(1)(a). The extent of such duty depends upon the content of speech. For instance, in respect of speech that is likely to be adverse to the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality; or speech that constitutes contempt of court, defamation or is of such nature as would be likely to incite the commission of an offence, the duty of the State to abstain from interference, is nil. This principle is Constitutionally reflected under Article 19(2) which enables the State to enact law which would impose reasonable restrictions on such speech as described under the eight grounds listed hereinabove which are the basis for reasonable restrictions. b) Per contra, in respect of speech and expression which constitutes an exchange of ideas, including dissent or disagreement, and such ideas are expressed in a manner compatible with the ethos cultivated in a civilised society, the duty of the State to abstain from interference, is high. 28 c) Similarly, in respect of commercial speech, the State is completely free to recall or curb commercial speech which is false, misleading, unfair or deceptive. Therefore, the threshold of tolerance towards commercial speech or advertisements depends on the content of such speech and the object of the material sought to be propagated/circulated. The duty of the State to abstain from interference would also depend upon the nature and effect of the commercial speech. d) As is evident from the above illustrations, the extent of protection of speech would depend on whether, such speech would constitute a ‘propagation of ideas’ or would have any social value. If the answer to the said question is in the affirmative, such speech would be protected under Article 19(1)(a); if the answer is in the negative, such speech would not be protected under Article 19(1)(a). In respect of speech that does not form the content of Article 19(1)(a), the State has no duty to abstain from interference having regard to Article 19(2) of the Constitution and only the grounds mentioned therein. e) Having noted that the protective perimeter within which a person can exercise his/her rights depends on the degree to which the State is duty bound to protect the right, it may also be said as a corollary that in respect of speech that does 29 not form the content of Article 19(1)(a), the State has no duty to abstain from interference and therefore, speech such as hate speech, defamatory speech, etc. would lie outside the protective perimeter within which a person can exercise his right to freedom of speech. Such speech can be subjected to restrictions or restraints. While restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and expression are required to be made only under the grounds listed under Article 19(2), by the State, restraints on the said right, do not gather their strength from Article 19(2). Restraints on the right to freedom of speech and expression are governed by the content of Article 19(1)(a) itself; i.e., any kind of speech, which does not conform to the content of the right under Article 19(1)(a), may be restrained. Questions pertaining to the voluntary or binding nature of such restraint, the force behind the same, the persons on whom such restraints are to be imposed, the manner in which compliance thereof could be achieved, etc., are aspects left to be deliberated upon and answered by the Parliament. However, the finding made hereinabove is only to the extent of clarifying that any kind of speech, which does not form the content of Article 19(1)(a), may be restrained as such speech does not constitute an exchange of ideas, in a manner compatible with the ethos cultivated in a civilised society. Such 30 restraints need not be traceable only to Article 19(2), which exhaustively lists eight grounds on which restrictions may be imposed on the right to freedom of speech and expression by the state. The Content of Article 19(1)(a): 15. The freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) is a right with diverse facets, both with regard to the content of speech and expression, and the medium through which communication takes place. It is also a dynamic concept that has evolved with time and advances in technology. In short, Article 19(1)(a) covers the right to express oneself by word of mouth, through writing, pictorial form, graphics, or in any other manner. It includes the freedom of communication and the right to propagate or publish one's views and opinions. The communication of ideas may be through any medium such as a book, newspaper, magazine or movie, including electronic and audio-visual media. 15.1. Right to Circulate: Freedom of the press takes within its fold a number of rights and one such right is the freedom of publication. Publication also means dissemination and circulation; indeed, without circulation, publication would be of little value, vide Romesh Thappar; Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. vs. Union of India, A.I.R. 1962 SC 305 (“Sakal Papers (P) Ltd.”). 31 In Life Insurance Corporation vs. Prof. Manubhai D. Shah, (1992) 3 SCC 637 (“Prof. Manubhai D. Shah”) this Court reiterated that the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) must be understood to take within its ambit the freedom to circulate one’s view. That such circulation could be by word of mouth, in writing or through audio-visual media. The freedom to ‘air one’s view’ was declared as a “lifeline of any democratic institution” and the Court expressed strong criticism at any attempt aimed at stifling or suffocating the right to circulation. In the said case, the appeals concerned separate instances of state-controlled entities (LIC and Doordarshan) refusing to publish or broadcast work that criticized the government. The Court reasoned that government-controlled means of publication have a greater burden to recognize an individual’s right to defend themselves and if a state censors content, then it is obligated to provide reasons valid in law. That when a state-controlled entity refuses to circulate through its magazine or other platform, one’s views, including one’s defence, the right to circulate is violated. This Court has therefore, on several occasions recognised the right to circulation, as a facet of the right to freedom of speech. The right to circulation includes, the right to optimise/maximise the volume of such circulation and also determine the content and reach thereof. 32 15.2. Right to dissent: Article 19(1)(a) serves as a vehicle through which dissent can be expressed. The right to dissent, disagree and adopt varying and individualistic points of view inheres in every citizen of this Country. In fact, the right to dissent is the essence of a vibrant democracy, for it is only when there is dissent that different ideas would emerge which may be of help or assist the Government to improve or innovate upon its policies so that its governance would have a positive effect on the people of the country which would ultimately lead to stability, peace and development which are concomitants of good governance. 15.3. The following judgments of this Court on the right to dissent are noteworthy: (i) In Romesh Thappar, this Court recognised that criticism or dissent directed against the Government, was not to be curtailed and any attempt to do so could not be justified as a reasonable restriction under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution. This declaration by this Court cemented the idea that the freedom of speech and expression covers the right to dissent or criticise, even when such right is employed with respect to criticism of governmental policy or action or inaction. It is now recognised that the right to 33 dissent is an essential pre-requisite of a healthy democracy and a facet of free speech. (ii) In Kedar Nath Singh vs. State of Bihar, A.I.R. 1962 SC 955 (“Kedar Nath Singh”) this Court considered a challenge to Sections 124-A and 505 of the IPC, which criminalised attempts targeted at exciting disaffection towards the Government, by words, or through writing and publications which may disturb public tranquillity. Although this Court dismissed the challenge to the vires of the aforestated provisions, it was clarified that criticism of measures adopted by the government, would be within the limits of, and consistent with the freedom of speech and expression. (iii) Subsequently, in Directorate General of Doordarshan vs. Anand Patwardhan, (2006) 8 SCC 433 (“Anand Patwardhan”) this Court observed that the State cannot prevent open discission, even when such discussion was highly critical of governmental policy. (iv) The right of an individual to hold unpopular or unconventional views was once again upheld in Khushboo wherein this Court quashed First Information Reports (FIRs) registered pertaining to offences under Sections 292, 499, 500, 504, 505, 509 of the IPC, based on complaints regarding the unpopular comments made by the appellant 34 therein, an actor, in a news magazine on the subject of pre- marital sex wherein she had urged women and girls to take necessary precautions to avoid the transmission of venereal diseases. In doing so, this Court observed that criminal law could not be set into motion in a manner as would interfere with the domain of personal autonomy. The Court upheld the appellant’s freedom of speech and expression and quashed the FIRs, expressing the need for tolerance even qua unpopular views. 15.4. Right to advertise (commercial speech): As per the dictionary meaning, the expression \"advertise\" means, to draw attention to, or describe goods for sale, services offered, etc., through any medium, such as newspaper, television or other electronic media, etc., in order to encourage people to buy or use them. In other words, it is to draw attention to any product or service. \"Advertisement\" is a public notice, announcement, picture in a newspaper or on a wall or hoarding in the street etc., which advertises something. In short, it is to advert attention to something and in the commercial sense, to draw attention to goods for sale or services offered. In that sense, an advertisement is commercial speech. A glimpse of the following cases would be useful: 35 (i) In Hamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan vs. Union of India, A.I.R 1960 SC 554 (“Hamdard Dawakhana”) this Court held that an advertisement is a form of speech, but its true character is reflected by the object for the promotion of which it is employed. However, this Court qualified its observations with the caveat that when advertisement takes the form of commercial advertisement which has an element of trade or commerce, it no longer falls within the concept of freedom of speech, for, the object is not propagation of ideas - social, political or economic or furtherance of literature or human thought; but the commendation of the efficacy, value and importance of the product it seeks to advertise. In the said case, this Court did not recognize commercial speech on par with other forms of speech by holding that it did not have the same value as political or creative expression. That broadly, the right to publish and distribute commercial advertisements advertising an individual's personal business is a part of freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution, but not every advertisement is a matter which comes within the scope of freedom of speech, nor can it be said that it is an expression of ideas. In every case, one has to see what is the nature of advertisement and what is the business/commercial activity falling under Article 19(1)(g) it seeks to further. 36 In the aforesaid case, what was challenged was the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954. It was held that the object of the Act was the prevention of self- medication and self-treatment by prohibiting advertisements, which may be used to advocate the same or which tended to spread the evil. It was further held that the advertisements of Hamdard Dawakhana, appellant in the said case, were relating to commerce or trade and not propagation of ideas. Such advertising of prohibited drugs or commodities the sale of which was not in the interest of the general public, cannot be \"speech\" within the meaning of freedom of speech and would not fall within Article 19(1)(a). It is therefore evident that this Court in the said case placed weight on the aspect as to whether, the advertisement sought to be protected, did in fact constitute ‘propagation of ideas.’ The true content and object of the material sought to be propagated/circulated was to be assessed, in order to declare whether such content would enjoy the protection of Article 19(1)(a). (ii) Subsequently, in Indian Express Newspaper (Bombay) Pvt. Ltd. vs. Union of India, (1985) 1 SCC 641 (“Indian Express Newspaper (Bombay) Pvt. Ltd.”), this Court considered the decision in Hamdard Dawakhana and 37 observed that the main plank of said decision was the type of advertisement or the content thereof and that particular advertisement did not carry with it the protection of Article 19(1)(a). It was further clarified that the observations made in Hamdard Dawakhana are too broadly stated. That all commercial advertisements cannot be denied the protection of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution merely because they are issued by businessmen. (iii) Subsequently, in Tata Press Limited vs. Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, (1995) 5 SCC 139 (“Tata Press Limited”), this Court clarified that commercial speech, which is entitled to protection under the First Amendment in USA is also protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution. However, in the USA, the State was completely free to recall commercial speech which is false, misleading, unfair, deceptive and which proposes illegal transactions in USA. But, under the Indian Constitution, commercial speech which is deceptive, unfair, misleading and untruthful, would be hit by Article 19(2) of the Constitution and can be regulated/prohibited by the State. 15.5. Compelled Speech: Compelled or forced speech is speech which compels a person to state a thing. It is in the form of a \"must carry\" 38 provision in a statute. An example of compelled speech is a provision mandating printing of the ingredients, its measure and such other details on a food product or pharmaceutical item. The object is to inform and, in some cases, warn a potential consumer about the nature of the product. Such compelled speech cannot be a violation of the freedom of speech and expression. But if the State compels a citizen to carry out propaganda or a point of view contrary to his wish then it may be a restriction on his freedom of speech and expression, which must be justified as per Article 19(2) of the Constitution. But, if the “must carry” provision furthers informed decision making, which is the essence of free speech and expression, then it will not amount to a violation of Article 19(1)(a). The following judgments could be cited in the aforesaid context: (i) In Union of India vs. Motion Picture Association, A.I.R. 1999 SC 2334 (“Motion Picture Association”), this Court held that whether compelled speech will or will not amount to a violation of the freedom of speech and expression, would depend upon the nature of a \"must carry\" provision. It observed that, if a \"must carry\" provision further informed decision-making, which is the essence of the right to free speech and expression, it will not amount to any violation of the fundamental freedom of speech and expression. However, if such a provision compels a person to carry out 39 propaganda or project a partisan or distorted point of view, contrary to his wish, it may amount to a restraint on his freedom of speech and expression. It may also violate other fundamental rights such as Article 19 (1) (g) or right against self-incrimination which is protected under Article 20 (3) of the Constitution. (ii) Therefore, this Court, in the said case, once again laid stress on the ideas and information sought to be communicated, by way of compelling the transmission of such ideas. The content of the information which is compelled to be carried was found to be highly relevant. Thus, the right under Article 19(1)(a) is a multi-faceted freedom and includes within its expanse, inter-alia, the right to gender identity as a facet of freedom of expression, vide National Legal Services Authority vs. Union of India, (2014) 5 SCC 438 (“National Legal Services Authority”); the right of the press to conduct interviews, vide Prabha Dutt vs. Union of India, (1982) 1 SCC 1 (“Prabha Dutt”); the right to attend proceedings in Court and report the same, vide Swapnil Tripathi vs. Supreme Court of India, (2018) 10 SCC 639 (“Swapnil Tripathi”); the right to fly the national flag vide Union of India vs. Naveen Jindal, (2004) 2 SCC 510 (“Naveen Jindal”). The right to silence, often regarded as the very converse of ‘speech,’ is also implicit in the freedom of 40 speech under Article 19(1)(a), as recognised in Bijoe Emmanuel vs. State of Kerala, (1986) 3 SCC 615 (“Bijoe Emmanuel”). 16. ‘Hate Speech’: 16.1. The various nuances of what has come to be termed as ‘hate speech’ could be discussed with reference to judgments of this Court as under: Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, Sri Kaleeswaram Raj submitted that, the contention of the petitioners in these cases is that the right to free speech which is a right against the State would also bring within its fold, a duty vis-à-vis not only the State but other citizens also in the matter of exercising the said freedom. In other words, what is sought to be addressed in these cases is what are the components or elements of the fundamental right of free speech and whether there could be limits on the right to free speech de hors Article 19(2) of the Constitution, with a view to check, what has ubiquitously come to be known as ‘hate speech’ or ‘disparaging speech’. By this I do not restrict the scope of consideration in the instant cases only to speech made by public functionaries, but the same shall also extend to speech by ordinary citizens, especially on social media. 41 16.2. This Court, in Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan vs. Union of India, (2014) 11 SC 477 (“Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan”) speaking through Dr. B.S. Chauhan, J., has dealt with ‘hate speech’ as having an innate relationship with the idea of discrimination. That the impact of such speech is not measured by its abusive value alone, but rather by how successfully and systematically it marginalises people. The definition of ‘hate speech’ as propounded by this Court in the aforesaid case, is extracted hereinunder: “Hate speech is an effort to marginalise individuals based on their membership in a group. Using expression that exposes the group to hatred, hate speech seeks to delegitimise group members in the eyes of the majority, reducing their social standing and acceptance within society. Hate speech, therefore rises beyond causing distress to individual group members. It can have a societal impact. Hate speech lays the groundwork for later, broad attacks on [the] vulnerable that can range from discrimination, to ostracism, segregation, deportation, violence and, in the most extreme cases, to genocide. Hate speech also impacts a protected group’s ability to respond to the substantive ideas under debate, thereby placing a serious barrier to their full participation in our democracy.” (Emphasis by me) This Court referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission vs. William Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11 (“Saskatchewan”) (Canada) wherein it was held that human rights obligations form the basis for the control of publication of \"hate speeches.\" The Canadian 42 Supreme Court further declared that the repugnancy of the ideas being expressed is not sufficient to justify restricting the expression, and whether or not the author of the expression intended to incite hatred or discriminatory treatment, is irrelevant. That the key is to determine the likely effect of the expression on its audience, keeping in mind the legislative objectives to reduce or eliminate discrimination. Placing reliance on the observations of the Canadian Supreme Court, this Court in Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan observed that the offence of hate speech is not limited to causing individual distress but would target persons who are members of certain groups or sections of society which breeds discrimination and consequently, hostility. 16.3. In India, human dignity is not only a value but a right that is enforceable. In a human-dignity-based democracy, freedom of speech and expression must be exercised in a manner that would protect and promote the rights of fellow-citizens. But hate speech, whatever its content may be, denies human beings the right to dignity. In this regard, it may be apposite to refer to a recent decision of this Court in Amish Devgan vs. Union of India, (2021) 1 SCC 1 (“Amish Devgan”) wherein this Court speaking through Sanjeev Khanna, J. undertook an analysis of ‘hate speech’ as being antithetical to, and incompatible with the foundations of human dignity. Protection of ‘Dignity’ as a 43 justification for criminalization of ‘hate speech’ was discussed as follows: “46. […] Dignity, in the context of criminalisation of speech with which we are concerned, refers to a person's basic entitlement as a member of a society in good standing, his status as a social equal and as bearer of human rights and constitutional entitlements. It gives assurance of participatory equality in inter-personal relationships between the citizens, and between the State and the citizens, and thereby fosters self-worth. Dignity in this sense does not refer to any particular level of honour or esteem as an individual, as in the case of defamation which is individualistic. 47. Preamble to the Constitution consciously puts together fraternity assuring dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation. Dignity of individual and unity and integrity of the nation are linked, one in the form of rights of individuals and other in the form of individual's obligation to others to ensure unity and integrity of the nation. The unity and integrity of the nation cannot be overlooked and slighted, as the acts that 'promote' or are 'likely' to 'promote' divisiveness, alienation and schematism do directly and indirectly impinge on the diversity and pluralism, and when they are with the objective and intent to cause public disorder or to demean dignity of the targeted groups, they have to be dealt with as per law. The purpose is not to curtail right to expression and speech, albeit not gloss over specific egregious threats to public disorder and in particular the unity and integrity of the nation. Such threats not only insidiously weaken virtue and superiority of diversity, but cut-back and lead to demands depending on the context and occasion, for suppression of freedom to express and speak on the ground of reasonableness. Freedom and rights cannot extend to create public disorder or armour those who challenge integrity and unity of the country or promote and incite violence. Without acceptable public order, freedom to speak and express is challenged and would get restricted for the common masses and law-abiding citizens. This invariably leads to State response and, therefore, those who indulge in promotion and incitement of violence to challenge unity and integrity of the nation or public 44 disorder tend to trample upon liberty and freedom of others.” (Emphasis by me) Further, referring to the views of Alice E. Marwick and Ross Millers in the report titled “Online Harassment, defamation, and Hateful Speech: A Primer of the Legal Landscape,” this Court in Amish Devgan elucidated as follows on three distinct elements that legislatures and courts can use to define and identify ‘hate speech’: “72.1. The content-based element involves open use of words and phrases generally considered to be offensive to a particular community and objectively offensive to the society. It can include use of certain symbols and iconography. By applying objective standards, one knows or has reasonable grounds to know that the content would allow anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, colour, creed, religion or gender. 72.2. The intent-based element of 'hate speech' requires the speaker's message to intend only to promote hatred, violence or resentment against a particular class or group without communicating any legitimate message. This requires subjective intent on the part of the speaker to target the group or person associated with the class/group. 72.3. The harm or impact-based element refers to the consequences of the ‘hate speech’, that is, harm to the victim which can be violent or such as loss of self- esteem, economic or social subordination, physical and mental stress, silencing of the victim and effective exclusion from the political arena. 72.4. Nevertheless, the three elements are not watertight silos and do overlap and are interconnected and linked. Only when they are present that they 45 produce structural continuity to constitute 'hate speech'.” It was further clarified that the effect of the words must be judged from the standard of “reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous men and not those who are weak and ones with vacillating minds, nor those who scent danger in every hostile point of view.” That in order to ensure maximisation of free speech, the assessment should be from the perspective of a reasonable member of the public. 16.4. Further, in a landmark Judgment of the United States’ Supreme Court in the matter of Chaplinsky vs. State of New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942) (“Chaplinsky”) “hate speech” was defined by Murphy J. to mean “fighting words, which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of peace. It has been observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.” 16.5. The term ‘hate speech’ does not find a specific place in Article 19(2) of the Constitution and it appears that it does not constitute a specific exception to the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a). Possibly the framers of the Constitution 46 did not find the same to be of relevance in the Indian social mosaic considering that the other cherished values of our Constitution such as fraternity and dignity of the individual would be strong factors which would negate any form of hate speech to be uttered in our Country. This may be having regard to our social and cultural values. However, with the passage of time, a wide range of Indian statutes have been enacted with a view to control hate speech. It may be useful to refer to a few of such provisions, with a view to examine the sufficiency of the existing framework in checking ‘hate speech’ although, the said term has not yet been precisely defined till date by the Parliament. i) The Indian Penal Code (“IPC”) contains provisions which prohibit hate speech. Section 153-A penalises the promotion of class hatred. Section 153-B penalises “imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration\". Section 295- A penalises insults to religion and to religious beliefs. Section 298 makes it a penal offence to utter words, makes sounds or gestures with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of another. Section 505 makes it a penal offence to incite any class or community against another. Chapter XXII, IPC punishes criminal intimidation. ii) Section 95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”) empowers the State Government to forfeit 47 publications that are punishable under Sections 124-A, 153-A, 153-B, 292, 293 or 295-A of the IPC. Section 107 empowers the Executive Magistrate to prevent a person from committing a breach of peace or disturbing public tranquillity or doing any wrongful act that may cause breach of peace or disturb public tranquillity. Section 144 empowers the District Magistrate, a Sub-divisional Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate specially empowered by the State Government in this behalf to issue orders in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger. The above offences are cognizable. iii) Section 7 of the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 penalises incitement to, and encouragement of untouchability through words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise. iv) Section 3(g) of the Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1988 prohibits religious institutions to allow the use of any premises belonging to, or under their control for promoting or attempting to promote disharmony, feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will between different religious, racial, linguistic or regional groups or castes or communities. v) Section 3(1)(x) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 punishes an intentional insult or intimidation with intent to humiliate a 48 member of a Scheduled Caste or Tribe in any place within public view. vi) Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 disqualifies a person from contesting elections if he is convicted for indulging in acts amounting to illegitimate use of freedom of speech and expression. Section 123(3-A) of the same Act declares \"the promotion of, or attempt to promote, feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens of India on grounds of religion, race, caste, community, or language, by a candidate or his agent or any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate\", a \"corrupt practice\". vii) The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 requires that all programmes and advertisements telecast on television conform to the Programme Code and the Advertisement Code. Rule 6, Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994 lays down the Programme Code and prohibits the carrying of any programme on the cable service which: (a) contains an attack on religion or communities or contains visuals or words contemptuous of religious groups or which promotes communal attitudes; 49 (b) is likely to encourage or incite violence or contains anything against maintenance of law and order or which promotes anti-national attitudes; (c) criticises, maligns or slanders any individual in person or certain groups, segments of social, public and moral life of the country; (d) contains visuals or words which reflect a slandering, ironical and snobbish attitude in the portrayal of certain ethnic, linguistic and regional groups. Similarly, the Advertising Code under Rule 7 of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994 prohibits the carriage of advertisements on the cable service which hurt the religious susceptibilities of subscribers, which derides any race, caste, colour, creed or nationality, or incite violence or disorder or breach of law. The Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 empowers the authorised officer appointed under the Act to prohibit the transmission of a programme or channel, if it is not in conformity with the Programme Code or the Advertisement Code; or if it is likely to promote disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, linguistic or regional groups; or is likely to disturb public tranquillity. Further, the Central Government is empowered to prohibit the transmission or 50 re-transmission of any channel or programme in the interest of the sovereignty, integrity or security of India or of public order. viii) Under the Cinematograph Act, 1952, a film can be denied certification on various grounds, including on the ground that it is likely to incite the commission of an offence or that it is against the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order. ix) The Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) allows the interception of information by the authorities in the interest of public order, or the sovereignty and integrity of India, or for the purpose of preventing incitement to the commission of a cognizable offence. Section 66-A of the same Act which sought to penalise information that is \"grossly offensive\" or of \"menacing character\" or despite knowledge that it is false, is sent to cause annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill-will, was struck down in Shreya Singhal on the ground of, inter alia, vagueness. x) Norms of Journalistic Conduct, 2010 issued by the Press Council of India (constituted under the Press Council Act, 1978) contain extensive guidelines on the reporting of communal incidents. 51 The content of speech is sought to be controlled in all the aforesaid statutes when the same is made not only by public functionaries but any ordinary citizen also through whatever medium of dissemination. 16.6. One of the recommendations of the 267th Law Commission was to insert Sections 153C and 505A and associated provisions in the CrPC to deal with ‘Hate Speech’. As per the Law Commission report, the proposed provisions would read as under: “153-C- Whoever on grounds of religion, race, caste or community, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, place of birth, residence, language, disability or tribe– (a) uses gravely threatening words either spoken or written, signs, visible representations within the hearing or sight of a person with the intention to cause, fear or alarm; or (b) advocates hatred by words either spoken or written, signs, visible representations, that causes incitement to violence shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, and fine up to Rs 5000, or with both.” “505-A- Causing fear, alarm, or provocation of violence in certain cases: Whoever in public intentionally on grounds of religion, race, caste or community, sex, gender, sexual orientation, place of birth, residence, language, disability or tribe uses words, or displays any writing, sign, or other visible representation which is gravely threatening, or derogatory; (i)within the hearing or sight of a person, causing fear or alarm, or; (ii) with the intent to provoke the use of unlawful violence, against that person or another, shall be 52 punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and/or fine up to Rs 5000, or both”. The proposed provision under Section 505-A, seeks to control not only speech that could potentially incite violence or hurt the feelings of a community or dampen national integrity, but also seeks to check threatening or derogatory remarks, made on grounds of religion, race, caste or community, sex, gender, sexual orientation, place of birth, residence, language, disability or tribe, and which cause fear or alarm. While speech of the former category has been traditionally regarded as ‘hate speech,’ generally vitriolic or ‘derogatory’ statements, which are made on the grounds of religion, race, caste or community, sex, gender, sexual orientation, place of birth, residence, language, disability or tribe, have traditionally not been considered to qualify as ‘hate speech,’ no matter how unwarranted or disparaging such statements may be. 16.7. Traditionally, ‘hate speech’ is the term used to describe speech that can potentially cause actual material harm through potential social, economic and political marginalisation of a community as declared by this Court in Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan. However, in the present case, in my opinion, we are concerned with a more overarching area of derogatory, vitriolic and disparaging speech, which is actually not ‘hate speech’ simplicitor as has been traditionally sought to be defined 53 and understood. I am concerned with speech that may not be linked to systematic discrimination and eventual political marginalisation of a community, but which may nonetheless have insidious effects on the societal perception of human dignity, values of social cohesion, fraternity and equality cherished by “We the people” of India. 16.8. Andrew F. Sellars, in his essay published by Harvard University, titled 'Defining Hate Speech,’ has examined the concept of ‘hate speech’ in different democratic jurisdictions. The author has identified that certain remarks, which, although may not be ‘hate speech’ in the strict sense of the term, border on the said term. That even tacit elements of intent of the speaker to cause harm, may constitute some species of hate speech. Intent may refer to non-physical aspects like to demean, vilify, humiliate, or being persecutorial, disregarding or hateful. The author has also recognised that in some contexts, “at home speeches” may themselves amount to hate speeches as such speech can now be uploaded and circulated in the virtual world through internet etc. The only pre-requisite is that the speech should have no redeeming purpose, which means that “the speech primarily carries no meaning other than hatred, hostility and ill-will.” 54 Beyond ‘hate speech’: 17. The expansive scope of ‘hate speech’ as set out above, would include within its sweep not only ‘hate speech’ simplicitor which is defined as speech aimed at systematic discrimination and eventual political marginalisation of a community, but also other species of derogatory, vitriolic and disparaging speech. 18. A philosophical justification to control and restrain derogatory, vitriolic and disparaging speech has been very poignantly conveyed by Lau Tzu, a celebrated Chinese philosopher and writer, in the following words: \"Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habit. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.” 19. Theoretical and doctrinal underpinnings justifying restraints on derogatory and disparaging speech, may be traced to two primary factors: human dignity as a value as well as a right; the Preambular goals of ‘equality’ and ‘fraternity.’ Human dignity as a value as well as a right under the Constitution of India: 20. As discussed supra, human dignity is not only a value but a right that is enforceable under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. In a human-dignity-based democracy, freedom of speech and expression 55 must be exercised in a manner that would protect and promote the rights of fellow-citizens. International practice: 21. In attempting to justify restraints on free speech, on the argument founded on considerations of autonomy, dignity and self-worth of the person(s) against whom derogatory statements are made, reference may be made to international practice in this regard. i) Canada: Canadian jurisprudence on the subject proceeds on the basis of inviolability of human dignity as its paramount value and specifically limits the freedom of expression when necessary to protect the right to personal honour. The Canadian approach emphasises on multiculturalism and group equality, as it places greater emphasis on cultural diversity and promotes the idea of an ethnic mosaic. Interestingly, the Canadian position, as discernible from the Canadian Supreme Court’s verdict in R vs. James Keegstra, (1990) 3 SCR 697 (“Keegstra”) (Canada) considers the likely impact of hate speech on both the targeted groups and non- targeted groups. The former are likely to be degraded and humiliated and experience injuries to their sense of self-worth and acceptance in the larger society and may well, as a consequence, avoid contact with members of the other group within the polity. The non-targeted members of the group, sometimes representing society at large, on the other hand, may gradually become de- 56 sensitised and may in the long run start accepting and believing the messages of hate directed towards racial and religious groups. These insidious effects pose serious threats to social cohesion in the long run rather than merely projecting immediate threats to violence. Further, Dixon C.J. of the Canadian Supreme Court in Canada Human Rights Commission vs. Taylor, (1990) 3 SCR 892 (“Taylor”) (Canada) has observed as follows, as regards the interrelationship between messages of hate propaganda and the values of dignity and equality: “...messages of hate propaganda undermine the dignity and self-worth of targeted group members and, more generally, contribute to disharmonious relations among various racial, cultural and religious groups, as a result eroding the tolerance and open mindedness that must flourish in a multicultural society which is committed to the idea of equality.” ii) Australia: The position of law in Australia is substantially aligned with that in Canada. The Australian Federal Court, in the case of Pat Eatock vs. Andrew Bolt, (2011) FCA 1103 (“Pat Eatock”) (Australia) followed the dictum in Keegstra in holding that the right to freedom of expression could be restricted vide legislation which made racial hatred a criminal offence. The Australian Federal Court stated that the rationale for a legislation restraining free speech was as follows: 57 “(a) The justification from pursuit of truth does not support the protection of hate propaganda, and may even detriment our search for truth. The more erroneous or mendacious a statement, the less its value in the quest of truth. We must not overemphasise that rationality will overcome all falsehoods. (b) Self-fulfilment and autonomy, in a large part, come from one's ability to articulate and nurture an identity based on membership in a cultural or religious group. The extent to which this value furthers free speech should be modulated insofar as it advocates an intolerant and prejudicial disregard for the process of individual self- development and human flourishing. (c) The justification from participation in democracy shows a shortcoming when expression is employed to propagate ideas repugnant to democratic values, thus undermining the commitment to democracy. Hate propaganda argues for a society with subversion of democracy and denial of respect and dignity to individuals based on group identities.” iii) South Africa: The position which regards dignity as a paramount constitutional value has been recognised in South Africa. The Constitutional Court has expressed willingness to subjugate freedom of expression when the same sufficiently undermines dignity. The constitutional provision, therefore, enjoins the legislature and the court to limit free speech rights and the exercise of those rights which deprive others of dignity. iv) Germany: The German law on the subject posits that freedom of expression is one amongst several rights which is limited by principles of equality, dignity and multiculturalism. Further, value of personal honour always triumphs over the right to utter untrue statements or facts made with the knowledge of their falsity. Also, 58 if true statements of fact invade the intimate personal sphere of an individual, the right to personal honour triumphs over the freedom of speech. If the expression of opinion as opposed to a fact constitutes a serious affront to the dignity of a person, the value of dignity triumphs over the speech. Therefore, German application strikes a balance between rights and duties, between the individual and the community on the one hand and between the self- expression needs of the speaker and the self-respect and dignity of the listeners on the other. It recognises the content-based speech regulation and also recognises the difference between fact and opinion. The inalienability of ‘human dignity’ under the Constitution of India vis-à-vis the right to freedom of speech and expression: 22. In Charu Khurana vs. Union of India, (2015) 1 SCC 192 (“Charu Khurana”), this Court declared that dignity is the quintessential quality of personality and a basic constituent of the rights guaranteed and protected under Article 21. Dignity is a part of the individual rights that form the fundamental fulcrum of collective harmony and interest of a society. That while the right to speech and expression is absolutely sacrosanct, dignity as a part of Article 21 has its own significance. That dignity of an individual cannot be overridden and blotched by malice and vile and venal attacks to tarnish and destroy 59 the reputation of another by stating that the same curbs and puts unreasonable restriction on the freedom of speech and expression. Further, in In Re. Noise Pollution (V), (2005) 5 SCC 733 it was observed that Article 19(1)(a) cannot be cited as a justification for defeating the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 21. That a person speaking cannot violate the rights of others to enjoy a peaceful, comfortable and (noise) pollution free environment, guaranteed by Article 21. Having regard to the unequivocal declaration of this Court, to the effect that Article 21 could not be sacrificed at the altar of securing the widest amplitude of free speech rights, this premise can serve as a theoretical justification for prescribing restraints on derogatory and disparaging speech. Human dignity, being a primary element under the protective umbrella of Article 21, cannot be negatively altered on account of derogatory speech, which marks out persons as unequal and vilifies them leading to indignity. 23. Rule of Law, includes certain minimum requirements without which a legal system cannot exist. Professor Lon L. Fuller, a renowned American legal philosopher, has described these requirements collectively as the 'inner morality of law'. Such an understanding of the concept of Rule of Law places much emphasis on the centrality of individual dignity in a society governed by the Rule of Law. Justice 60 Aharon Barak, former Chief Justice of Israel, has lucidly explained this facet of Rule of law in the following manner: “The Rule of law is not merely public order, the Rule of law is social justice based on public order. The law exists to ensure proper social life. Social life, however, is not a goal in itself but a means to allow the individual to live in dignity and develop himself. The human being and human rights underlie this substantive perception of the Rule of law, with a proper balance among the different rights and between human rights and the proper needs of society. The substantive Rule of law \"is the Rule of proper law, which balances the needs of society and the individual\". This is the Rule of law that strikes a balance between society's need for political independence, social equality, economic development, and internal order, on the one hand, and the needs of the individual, his personal liberty, and his human dignity on the other. The Judge must protect this rich concept of the Rule of law.” (Emphasis by me) 24. As recognised by this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) vs. Union of India, (2019) 1 SCC 1 (“Puttaswamy”), a substantive aspect of the Rule of Law is the balance between the individual and society. In that background, this Court discussed the scope of Constitutional rights under our Constitutional scheme and the extent of their protection. While emphasising that there are no absolute constitutional rights, this Court laid down, in the following words that one of the only rights which is treated as \"absolute\" is the right to human dignity: “62. It is now almost accepted that there are no absolute constitutional rights [Though, debate on this vexed issue still continues and some 61 constitutional experts claim that there are certain rights, albeit very few, which can still be treated as \"absolute\". Examples given are:(a) Right to human dignity which is inviolable,(b) Right not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Even in respect of such rights, there is a thinking that in larger public interest, the extent of their protection can be diminished. However, so far such attempts of the States have been thwarted by the judiciary.] and all such rights are related. As per the analysis of Aharon Barak [Aharon Barak,Proportionality: Constitutional Rights and Their Limitation (Cambridge University Press 2012).], two key elements in developing the modern constitutional theory of recognising positive constitutional rights along with its limitations are the notions of democracy and the Rule of law. Thus, the requirement of proportional limitations of constitutional rights by a sub-constitutional law i.e. the statute, is derived from an interpretation of the notion of democracy itself. Insofar as the Indian Constitution is concerned, democracy is treated as the basic feature of the Constitution and is specifically accorded a constitutional status that is recognised in the Preamble of the Constitution itself. It is also unerringly accepted that this notion of democracy includes human rights which is the cornerstone of Indian democracy. Once we accept the aforesaid theory (and there cannot be any denial thereof), as a fortiori, it has also to be accepted that democracy is based on a balance between constitutional rights and the public interests. In fact, such a provision in Article 19 itself on the one hand guarantees some certain freedoms in Clause (1) of Article 19 and at the same time empowers the State to impose reasonable restrictions on those freedoms in public interest. This notion accepts the modern constitutional theory that the constitutional rights are related. This relativity means that a constitutional licence to limit those rights is granted where such a limitation will be justified to protect public interest or the rights of others. This phenomenon--of both the right and its limitation in the Constitution--exemplifies the inherent tension between democracy's two fundamental elements. On the one hand is the right's element, which constitutes a fundamental component of substantive democracy; on the other hand is the people element, limiting those very rights through their representatives. These two constitute a fundamental component of the notion of 62 democracy, though this time in its formal aspect. How can this tension be resolved? The answer is that this tension is not resolved by eliminating the \"losing\" facet from the Constitution. Rather, the tension is resolved by way of a proper balancing of the competing principles. This is one of the expressions of the multi-faceted nature of democracy. Indeed, the inherent tension between democracy's different facets is a \"constructive tension\". It enables each facet to develop while harmoniously coexisting with the others. The best way to achieve this peaceful coexistence is through balancing between the competing interests. Such balancing enables each facet to develop alongside the other facets, not in their place. This tension between the two fundamental aspects-- rights on the one hand and its limitation on the other hand--is to be resolved by balancing the two so that they harmoniously coexist with each other. This balancing is to be done keeping in mind the relative social values of each competitive aspects when considered in proper context.” [Emphasis by me] 25. It is clarified that at this juncture that it is not necessary to engage in the exercise of balancing our concern for the free flow of ideas and the democratic process, with our desire to further equality and human dignity. This is because no question would arise as to the conflict of two seemingly competing rights, being the right to freedom of speech and expression, vis-à-vis the right to human dignity and equality. The reason for the same is because, the restraint that is called for, is only in relation to unguided, derogatory, vitriolic speech, which in no way can be considered as an essential part of exposition of ideas, which has little social value. This discourse, in no way seeks to pose a potential danger to peaceful dissenters, who exercise their right to freedom of speech and expression in a critical, but measured fashion. 63 The present cases pertain specifically to derogatory, disparaging speech, which closely resembles hate speech. Such speech does not fall within the protective perimeter of Article 19(1)(a) and does not constitute the content of the free speech right. Therefore, when such speech has the effect of infringing the fundamental right under Article 21 of another individual, it would not constitute a case which requires balancing of conflicting rights, but one wherein abuse of the right to freedom of speech by a person has attacked the fundamental rights of another. The Preambular goals of ‘equality’ and ‘fraternity’: 26. Equality, liberty and fraternity are the foundational values embedded in the Preamble of our Constitution. ‘Hate speech’, in the sense discussed hereinabove, strikes at each of these foundational values, by marking out a society as being unequal. It also violates fraternity of citizens from diverse backgrounds, the sine-qua-non of a cohesive society based on plurality and multi-culturalism such as in India that is, Bharat. 27. Fraternity is based on the idea that citizens have reciprocal responsibilities towards one another. The term takes within its sweep, inter-alia, the ideals of tolerance, co-operation, and mutual aid. 27.1. The meaning of the term fraternity, in the context of criminal defamation and restraints on the freedom of speech and 64 expression has been examined by this Court in Subramanian Swamy vs. Union of India, (2016) 7 SCC 221 (“Subramanian Swamy”) wherein it was observed that fraternity under the Constitution expects every citizen to respect the dignity of the other. Mutual respect is the fulcrum of fraternity that assures dignity. This Court qualified its observations with the caveat that ‘fraternity’ does not mean that there cannot be dissent or difference, more so because all citizens have the right to freedom of speech and expression. However, it was unequivocally declared that a constitutional value which is embedded in the idea of fraternity is dignity of the individual, which is required to be respected by fellow citizens. That the Preamble consciously chooses to assure the dignity of the individual, in the context of fraternity and therefore, rights enshrined in Part III have to be exercised by individuals against the backdrop of the ideal of fraternity. This Court observed that the fraternal ideal also finds resonance in Part IVA of the Constitution. In upholding the permissibility of the law on criminal defamation, on the touchstone of the concept of constitutional fraternity, this Court speaking through Dipak Misra, J. (as his Lordship then was) observed in paragraphs 155 and 163, as follows: “155. It is a constitutional value which is to be cultivated by the people themselves as a part of their social behavior. There are two schools of thought; one canvassing individual liberalization and the other advocating for protection of an individual as 65 a member of the collective. The individual should have all the rights under the Constitution but simultaneously he has the responsibility to live upto the constitutional values like essential brotherhood- the fraternity-that strengthens the societal interest. Fraternity means brotherhood and common interest. Right to censure and criticize does not conflict with the constitutional objective to promote fraternity. Brotherliness does not abrogate and rescind the concept of criticism. In fact, brothers can and should be critical. Fault finding and disagreement is required even when it leads to an individual disquiet or group disquietude. Enemies Enigmas Oneginese on the part of some does not create a dent in the idea of fraternity but, a significant one, liberty to have a discordant note does not confer a right to defame the others.” “163. We have referred to two concepts, namely, constitutional fraternity and the fundamental duty, as they constitute core constitutional values. Respect for the dignity of another is a constitutional norm. It would not amount to an overstatement if it is said that constitutional fraternity and the intrinsic value inhered in fundamental duty proclaim the constitutional assurance of mutual respect and concern for each other's dignity. The individual interest of each individual serves the collective interest and correspondingly the collective interest enhances the individual excellence. Action against the State is different than an action taken by one citizen against the other. The constitutional value helps in structuring the individual as well as the community interest. Individual interest is strongly established when constitutional values are respected. The Preamble balances different and divergent rights. Keeping in view the constitutional value, the legislature has not repealed Section 499 and kept the same alive as a criminal offence. The studied analysis from various spectrums, it is difficult to come to a conclusion that the existence of criminal defamation is absolutely obnoxious to freedom of speech and expression. As a prescription, it neither invites the frown of any of the Articles of the Constitution nor its very existence can be regarded as an unreasonable restriction.” (Emphasis by me) 66 27.2. The decision of this Court in Subramanian Swamy establishes precedent of justifying a restraint on free speech, on the ground of promotion of fraternity. It has been recognized that the constitutional value of fraternity imputes an obligation on all citizens to subserve collective interest and respect the dignity and equality of fellow citizen. Restraints on free speech prescribed to secure these ends, have been held to be justified, as being aimed at preserving the Preambular ideal of fraternity. It is also to be noted that this Court in the said case recognized that fraternity as a value is to be cultivated by citizens themselves as a part of their social behavior by refraining from uttering defamatory statements. This chord of the said judgment, acknowledges the idea of self-restraint or inherent restraints as being read into the right to freedom of speech and expression. 27.3. Democracy, being one of the basic features of our Constitution, it is implicit that in a rule by majority there would be a sense of security and inclusiveness. Further, the Preamble of the Constitution which envisages, inter alia, fraternity, assures that the dignity of individuals cannot be dented by means of unwarranted speech being made by fellow citizens, including public functionaries. Thus, the Preamble of the Constitution and the values thereof assuring the people of India not only justice, 67 liberty, equality but also fraternity and unity and integrity of the nation, must remind every citizen of this Country irrespective of the office or position or power that is held, of the sublime ideals of the Constitution and to respect them in their true letter and spirit. There is an inbuilt constitutional check to ensure that the values of the Constitution are not in any way undermined or violated. It is high time that we, as a society in general and as individuals in particular, re-dedicate ourselves to the sacred values of the Constitution and promote them not only at our individual level but at the macro level. Any kind of speech which undermines the values for which our Constitution stands would cause a dent on our social and political values. Employing the Fundamental Duties under Part IV-A of the Constitution as a means to check disparaging, unwarranted speech: 28. Every right engulfs and incorporates a duty to respect another’s right and secure mutual compatibility and conviviality of the individuals based on collective harmony, resulting in social order. The concept of fraternity under the Constitution expects every citizen to respect the dignity of the other. Mutual respect is the fulcrum of fraternity that assures dignity. In the context of constitutional fraternity, fundamental duties engrafted under Article 51-A of the Constitution gain significance. 68 Sub-clause (c), (e) and (j) of Article 51-A of the Constitution which are relevant to these cases read as follows: “Article 51-A. Fundamental Duties- .—It shall be the duty of every citizen of India— (a) xxx (b) xxx (c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India; (d) xxx (e) to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women; (f) xxx (g) xxx (h) xxx (i) xxx (j) to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement;” Fundamental duties also constitute core Constitutional values for good citizenship in a democracy such as ours. The duties enumerated above, enjoin all citizens with the obligations of promoting fraternity, harmony, unity, collective welfare etc. Fundamental duties have a keen bond of sorority with the Constitutional goals and must therefore be recognised not merely as Constitutional norms or precepts but as obligations, corelative to rights. In short, the permissible content of the right to freedom of speech and expression, ought to be tested on the touchstone of fraternity and fundamental duties as envisaged under our Constitution. 69 29. Although the questions for consideration before the Constitution bench, were with specific regard to the possible restraints on unwarranted and disparaging speech by public functionaries, the observations made hereinabove, will apply with equal force to public functionaries, celebrities/influencers as well as all citizens of India, more so because technology is being used as a medium of communication which has a wide spectrum of impact across the globe. 30. The internet represents a communication revolution and has enabled us to communicate with millions of people worldwide, with no more difficulty than communicating with a single person, at a click or by touch on a screen. Ironically, the very qualities of the internet that have revolutionised communication are amenable to misuse. The internet, through various social media platforms has accelerated the pace as well as the reach of messages, comments and posts to such an extent that the difference between a celebrity and a common man, has been practically negated, in so far as the reach of their speech is concerned. 31. However, given the specific submission of the petitioners herein that disparaging and vitriolic speech expressed at various levels of political authority have exacerbated a climate bordering on intolerance and tension in the society, which perhaps may lead to insecurity, it may be appropriate to sound a strong word of warning in this regard. 70 32. It may be appropriate at this juncture to refer to the writings of Michael Rosenfeld, on the key variables which determine the impact of hate speech. One of the key variables highlighted by the learned author in his paper titled “Hate Speech in Constitutional Jurisprudence: A Comparative Analysis,” published in Cardozo Law Review, is the question as to “who” the speaker is. The learned author notes that speech made by a person of influence, such as a top government or executive functionary, opposition leader, political or social leader of following, or a credible anchor on a TV show carries far more credibility and impact than a statement made by a common person. Public functionaries and other persons of influence and celebrities, having regard to their reach, real or apparent authority and the impact they wield on the public or on a certain section thereof, owe a duty to the citizenry at large to be more responsible and restrained in their speech. They are required to understand and measure their words, having regard to the likely consequences thereof on public sentiment and behaviour, and also be aware of the example they are setting for fellow citizens to follow. 33. While there are no infallible rules that can be formulated by the Court to define the precise threshold of acceptable speech, every citizen’s conscious attempt to abide by the Constitutional values, and to preserve in letter and spirit the culture contemplated under the Constitution will significantly contribute in eliminating instances of 71 societal discord, friction and disharmony, on account of disparaging, vitriolic and derogatory speech, particularly when made by public functionaries and/or public figures. This does not in any way imply that ordinary citizens who form the great mass of the citizenry of this Country can shun responsibility for vitriolic, unnecessarily critical, diabolical speech, bordering on all those aspects mentioned under Article 19 (2) either against public functionaries / figures or against other citizens in general or against particular individuals. 34. Every citizen of India must consciously be restrained in speech, and exercise the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) only in the sense that it was intended by the framers of the Constitution, to be exercised. This is the true content of Article 19(1)(a) which does not vest with citizens unbridled liberty to utter statements which are vitriolic, derogatory, unwarranted, have no redeeming purpose and which, in no way amount to a communication of ideas. Article 19(1)(a) vests a multi-faceted right, which protects several species of speech and expression from interference by the State. However, it is a no brainer that the right to freedom speech and expression, in a human-rights based democracy does not protect statements made by a citizen, which strike at the dignity of a fellow citizen. Fraternity and equality which lie at the very base of our Constitutional culture and upon which the superstructure of rights are 72 built, do not permit such rights to be employed in a manner so as to attack the rights of another. Verse 15 of Chapter 17 of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita describes what constitutes discipline of speech or ‘vāṅ-maya tapas:’ अनुद्वेगकरं वाक्यं सत्यं प्रियहितं च यत ् | स्वाध्यायाभ्यसनं चैव वाङ्मयं तप उच्यते || Anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ satyaṁ priya-hitaṁ cha yat Svādhyāyābhyasanaṁ chaiva vāṅ-mayaṁ tapa uchyate Words that do not cause distress, are truthful, inoffensive, pleasing and beneficial, are said to be included within the discipline of speech, and are likened to regular recitation of the Vedic scriptures. 35. The discussion presented hereinabove was with a view to rekindle some ideas on the content of Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution and on other pertinent issues surrounding the right to free speech guaranteed under the aforesaid Article. However, as far as the substantial analysis of Question No. 1 is concerned, I respectfully agree with the reasoning and conclusions proposed by His Lordship, Ramasubramanian, J. Re: Question No. 2: Can a fundamental right under Article 19 or 21 of the Constitution be claimed other than against the ‘State’ or its instrumentalities? 36. All human beings are endowed at birth, with certain inalienable rights and among such rights are right to life and liberty, including liberty of thought and expression. These rights have been recognized as 73 inalienable rights, having regard to the supreme value of human personality. Incidentally, some of such rights have come to be Constitutionally recognized under Part III of the Constitution of India. Fundamental Rights were selected from what were previously natural rights and were later termed as common law rights. However, it is to be noted that Part III of the Constitution, is not the sole repository of such rights. Even after some of such inalienable rights have come to be Constitutionally recognised as Fundamental Rights under the Constitution of India, the congruent rights under common law or natural law have not been obliterated. It also follows, that the corresponding remedies available in common law, are also not obliterated. The object of elevating certain natural and common law rights, as Fundamental Rights under the Constitution was to make them specifically enforceable against the State and its agencies through a Courts of law. These observations gain legitimacy from the judgment of Mathew, J. in His Holiness Kesavanada Bharati Sripadagalvaru vs. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225 (Kesavanada Bharati) wherein His Lordship recognized the object of Constitutions to declare recognised natural rights as applicable qua the state. Adopting the picturesque language of Roscoe Pound, the following observations were made: “1514. While dealing with natural rights, Roscoe Pound states on page 500 of Vol. I of his Jurisprudence: 74 “Perhaps nothing contributed so much to create and foster hostility to courts and law and Constitutions as this conception of the courts as guardians of individual natural rights against the state and against society; this conceiving of the law as a final and absolute body of doctrine declaring these individual natural rights; this theory of Constitutions as declaratory of common- law principles, which are also natural-law principles, anterior to the state and of superior validity to enactments by the authority of the state; this theory of Constitutions as having for their purpose to guarantee and maintain the natural rights of individuals against the government and all its agencies. In effect, it set up the received traditional social, political, and economic ideals of the legal profession as a super-Constitution, beyond the reach of any agency but judicial decision. 1515. I may also in this connection refer to a passage on the inherent and inalienable rights in A History of American Political Theories by C. Marriam: By the later thinkers the idea that men possess inherent and inalienable rights of a political or quasi-political character which are independent of the state, has been generally given up. It is held that these natural rights can have no other than an ethical value, and have no proper place in politics. There never was, and there never can be,' says Burgess, 'any liberty upon this earth and among human beings, outside of state organization'. In speaking of natural rights, therefore, it is essential to remember that these alleged rights have no political force whatever, unless recognized and enforced by the state. It is asserted by Willoughby that 'natural rights' could not have even a moral value in the supposed 'state of nature'; they would really be equivalent to force and hence have no ethical significance. (see p. 310).” x x xx x x x “1522. I am also of the view that the power to amend the provisions of the Constitution relating to the fundamental rights cannot be denied by describing 75 the fundamental rights as natural rights or human rights. The basic dignity of man does not depend upon the codification of the fundamental rights nor is such codification a prerequisite for a dignified way of living. There was no Constitutional provision for fundamental rights before January 26, 1950 and yet can it be said that there did not exist conditions for dignified way of living for Indians during the period between August 15, 1947 and January 26,. 1950. The plea that provisions of the Constitution, including those of Part III, should be given retrospective effect has been rejected by this Court. Article 19 which makes provision for fundamental rights, is not applicable to persons who are not citizens of India. Can it, in view of that, be said that the non-citizens cannot while staying in India lead a dignified life? It would, in my opinion, be not a correct approach to say that amendment of the Constitution relating to abridgement or taking away of the fundamental rights would have the effect of denuding human beings of basic dignity and would result in the extinguishment of essential values of life.” [Emphasis by me] 37. This proposition was further highlighted in the enlightened minority opinion of His Lordship, H.R. Khanna, J, in Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur vs. Shivakant Shukla, A.I.R. 1976 SC 1207 (“ADM Jabalpur”) wherein while refusing to subscribe to the view that when the right to enforce Fundamental Right under Article 21 is suspended, the result would be that there would be no remedy against deprivation of a person's life or liberty by the State even though such deprivation is without the authority of law, observed, that Article 21 was not the sole repository of the right to life and personal liberty. That such rights inhered in men even prior to the enactment of 76 the Constitution, and were not created for the first time by enacting the Constitution. It was also recognised that though the Constitutionally recognised remedy under Article 32, for infringement of the Right under Article 21 may not be available as the said rights remained suspended or notionally surrendered on account of declaration of an Emergency, remedies under the laws which were in force prior to the coming into effect of the Constitution would still operate to ensure that no person could be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with law. In that context, it was held that the rights Constitutionally recognised under Article 21, represented ‘higher values’ which were elementary to any civilised State and therefore the sanctity of life and liberty was not traceable only to the Constitution. The relevant portions of His Lordship’s judgment can be usefully extracted hereinunder: “152. The effect of the suspension of the right to move any court for the enforcement of the right conferred by Article 21, in my opinion, is that when a petition is filed in a court, the court would have to proceed upon the basis that no reliance can be placed upon that Article for obtaining relief from the court daring the period of emergency. Question then arises as to whether the rule that no one shall be deprived of ins life or personal liberty without the authority of law stiff survives during the period: of emergency despite the Presidential order suspending the right to move any court for the enforcement of the-right contained in Article 21. The answer to this question is linked with the answer to the question as to whether Article 21 is, the sole repository of the right to life and personal liberty. After giving the matter my earnest consideration, I am of the opinion that Article 21 cannot be considered\" to be the sole repository of the right to life and; personal liberty. The right to life, and personal: liberty is the most precious 77 right of human beings in civilised societies governed by the rule of law. Many modern constitutions incorporate certain fundamental rights, including the one relating to personal freedom.” xxx “155. Sanctity of life and liberty was not something new when the Constitution was drafted. It represented a fact of higher values which mankind began to cherish in its evolution from a state of tooth and claw to a civilized existence. Likewise, the principle that no one shall be deprived of ins life and liberty without the authority of law was not the gift of the Constitution. It was a necessary corollary of the concept relating to the sanctity of life and liberty; it existed and was in force before the coming into force, of the Constitution. The idea about the sanctity of life and liberty as well as the principle that no one shall be deprived of his life and liberty without the authority of law are essentially two facets of the same concept. This concept grew and acquired dimensions in response to the inner urges and nobler impulses with the march of civilisation. Great writers and teachers, philosophers and political thinkers nourished and helped in the efflorescence of the concept by rousing the conscience of mankind and by making it conscious of the necessity of the concept as necessary social discipline in self-interest and for orderly existence. According even to the theory of social compact many aspects of which have now been discredited, individuals have surrendered a part of their theoretically unlimited freedom in return or the blessings of the government. Those blessings include governance in accordance with certain norms in the matter of life and liberty of the citizens. Such norms take the shape of the rule of law. Respect for law, we must bear in mind, has a mutual relationship with respect for government. Erosion of the respect for law, it has accordingly been said, affects the respect for the government. Government under the law means, as observed by Macdonald, that the power to govern shall be exercised only, under conditions laid down in constitutions and laws approved by either the people or their representatives. Law thus emerges as a norm limiting the application of power by the government 78 over the citizen or by citizens over their fellows. Theoretically all men are equal before the law and are equally bound by it regardless of their status, class, office or authority. At the same time that the law enforces duties it also protects rights, even against the sovereign.” x x x 158. I am unable to subscribe to the view that when right to enforce the right under Article 21 is suspended, the result would be that there would be no remedy against deprivation of a person's life or liberty by the State even though such deprivation is without the authority of law or even in flagrant violation of the provisions of law. The right not to be deprived of one's life or liberty without the authority of law was not the creation of the Constitution. Such right existed before the Constitution came into force. The fact that the framers of the Constitution made an aspect of such right a part of the fundamental rights did not have the effect of exterminating the independent identity of such right and of making Article 21 to be the sole repository of that right. Its real effect was to ensure that a law under which a person can be deprived of ins life or personal liberty should prescribe a procedure for such deprivation or, according to the dictum laid down by Mukherjea, J. in Gopalan's case, such law should be a valid law not violative of fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. Recognition as fundamental right of one aspect of the pre-Constitutional right cannot have the effect of making things less favourable so far as the sanctity of life and personal liberty is concerned compared to the position if an aspect of such right had not been recognised as fundamental right because, of the vulnerability of fundamental rights accruing from Article 359. I am also unable to agree that in view of the Presidential Order in the matter of sanctity of life and liberty, things would be worse off compared to the state of law as it existed before the coining into force of the Constitution.” x x x 79 “162. It has been pointed out above that even before the coming into force of the Constitution, the position under the common law both in England and in India was that the State could not deprive a person of ins life and liberty without the authority of law. The same was the position under the penal laws of India. It was an offence under the Indian Penal Code, as already mentioned, to deprive a person of ins life or liberty unless such a course was sanctioned by the laws of the land. An action was also maintainable under the law of torts for wrongful confinement in case any person was deprived of ins personal liberty without the authority of law. In addition to that, we had Section 491 of the CrPC which provided the remedy of habeas corpus against detention without the authority of law. Such laws continued to remain in force in view of Article 372 after the coming into force of the Constitution. According to that article, notwithstanding the repeal by this Constitution of the enactments referred to in Article 395 but subject to the other provisions of this Constitution, all the law in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall continue in force therein until altered or repealed or amended by a competent legislature or other competent authority. The law in force, as observed by the majority of the Constitution Bench in the case of Director of Rationing and Distribution v. The Corporation of Calcutta and Ors. 1960 CriLJ 1684, include not only the statutory law but also custom or usage haying the force of law as also the common law of England which, was adopted as the law of the country before the coming into force of the Constitution. The position thus seems to be firmly established that at the time, the Constitution came into force, the legal position was that no one could be deprived of ins life or liberty without the- authority of law. 163. It is difficult to accede to the contention that because of Article 21 of the Constitution, the law which was already in force that no one could be deprived of ins life or liberty without the authority of law was obliterated and ceased to remain in force. No rule of construction interpretation warrants such an inference. Section 491 of the CrPC continued to remain an integral part of that Code despite the fact that the High Courts were 80 vested with the power of issuing writs of habeas corpus under Article 226. No submission was ever advanced on the score that the said provision had become a dead letter of enforceable because of the fact that Article 226 was made a part of the Constitution, indeed, in the case of Makhan Singh (supra) Gajendragadkar J. speaking for the majority stated that after the coming into force of the Constitution, a party could avail of either the remedy of Section 491 of the CrPC or that of Article 226 of the Constitution. The above observations clearly go to show that constitutional recognition of the remedy of writ of habeas corpus did not obliterate or abrogate the statutory remedy of writ of habeas corpus. Section 491 of the CrPC continued to be part of that Code till that Code was replaced by the new Code. Although the remedy of writ of habeas corpus is not now available under the new CrPC, 1973, the same remedy is still available under Article 226 of the Constitution.” [Emphasis by me] In holding thus, H.R. Khanna, J. refused to subscribe to the majority view in the said case that once a right is recognised and embodied in the Constitution and forms part of it, it could not have any separate existence apart from the Constitution, unless it were also enacted as a statutory principle by some positive law of the State. His Lordship rejected the proposition that the intention of the Constitution was not to preserve something concurrently in the field of natural law or common law; it was to exclude all other control or to make the Constitution the sole repository of ultimate control over those aspects of human freedom which were guaranteed therein. 38. The strength of H.R. Khanna, J’s minority opinion was subsequently acknowledged and affirmed by this Court in 81 Puttaswamy, wherein it was held that the rights to life and personal liberty were ‘primordial rights’ and were not bounties which were conferred by the State and created by the Constitution. That the right to life existed even before the advent of the Constitution and in recognising such right, the Constitution did not become the sole repository of such rights. That every constitutional democracy including our country, is rooted in an undiluted assurance that the Rule of law will protect their rights and liberties against any invasion by the State and that judicial remedies would be available when a citizen has been deprived of most precious inalienable rights. Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud. J. (as His Lordship then was) enunciated the aforesaid principles in the following words: “119. The judgments rendered by all the four judges constituting the majority in ADM Jabalpur are seriously flawed. Life and personal liberty are inalienable to human existence. These rights are, as recognised in Kesavananda Bharati, primordial rights. They constitute rights under natural law. The human element in the life of the individual is integrally founded on the sanctity of life. Dignity is associated with liberty and freedom. No civilized state can contemplate an encroachment upon life and personal liberty without the authority of law. Neither life nor liberty are bounties conferred by the state nor does the Constitution create these rights. The right to life has existed even before the advent of the Constitution. In recognising the right, the Constitution does not become the sole repository of the right. It would be preposterous to suggest that a democratic Constitution without a Bill of Rights would leave individuals governed by the state without either the existence of the right to live or the means of enforcement of the right. The right to life being inalienable to each individual, it existed prior to 82 the Constitution and continued in force Under Article 372 of the Constitution. Justice Khanna was clearly right in holding that the recognition of the right to life and personal liberty under the Constitution does not denude the existence of that right, apart from it nor can there be a fatuous assumption that in adopting the Constitution the people of India surrendered the most precious aspect of the human persona, namely, life, liberty and freedom to the state on whose mercy these rights would depend. Such a construct is contrary to the basic foundation of the Rule of law which imposes restraints upon the powers vested in the modern state when it deals with the liberties of the individual. The power of the Court to issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus is a precious and undeniable feature of the Rule of law. 120. A constitutional democracy can survive when citizens have an undiluted assurance that the Rule of law will protect their rights and liberties against any invasion by the state and that judicial remedies would be available to ask searching questions and expect answers when a citizen has been deprived of these, most precious rights. The view taken by Justice Khanna must be accepted, and accepted in reverence for the strength of its thoughts and the courage of its convictions.” [Emphasis by me] 39. What emerges from the aforesaid decisions of this Court, may be culled out as follows: i) That some natural/primordial rights of man have been accorded a secure position under the Constitution so as to protect such rights against undue encroachments by organs of State. The object of elevation of such common law rights/natural rights to the Constitutional plane was to make them specifically enforceable against the State and its agencies through Courts of Law. 83 ii) Notwithstanding that such rights have been placed in Part III of the Constitution of India, the rights are concurrently preserved in the field of natural law or common law. Remedies available in common law for actualising such rights are also preserved. There are therefore two spheres of rights, and corresponding remedies: first, relatable to the Fundamental Rights enshrined under Part III the Constitution of India, which correspond to the remedies under Article 32 and Article 226 of the Constitution of India; second, inalienable/natural/common law rights, which are pre- constitutional rights, and may be protected by having recourse to common law remedies. iii) While the content of a certain common law right, may be identical to a Fundamental Right, the two rights would be distinct in two respects: first, incidence of the duty to respect such right; and second, the forum which would be called upon to adjudicate on the failure to respect such right. While the content of the right violated may be identical, the status of the violator, is what is relevant. With that primer, I shall proceed to consider whether the Fundamental Rights under Article 19 or 21 of the Constitution of India can be claimed against any person other than the State or its instrumentalities. 40. With historical and political changes and the advent of democracy and of Constitutional government, the “State” was created under and 84 by a constitution and placed at a position which renders it capable of interfering with natural and common law rights. On the other hand, as is evident from the text of the Preamble of the Constitution of India, the “We the People of India created the State as an entity to serve their interests. In order to reconcile the competing effects of creation of the State, certain common law rights were elevated to the constitutional plane by accommodating them in Part III of the Constitution of India to make them specifically enforceable against the State and its agencies through the Courts. Part III of the Constitution was therefore enacted to dictate the relationship between citizens and the State- this is the true character and utility of Part III. This idea has also found resonance in Puttaswamy, wherein it was observed as follows: “251. Constitutions address the rise of the new political hegemon that they create by providing for a means by which to guard against its capacity for invading the liberties available and guaranteed to all civilized peoples. Under our constitutional scheme, these means - declared to be fundamental rights - reside in Part III, and are made effective by the power of this Court and the High Courts Under Articles 32 and 226 respectively. This narrative of the progressive expansion of the types of rights available to individuals seeking to defend their liberties from invasion - from natural rights to common law rights and finally to fundamental rights - is consistent with the account of the development of rights that important strands in constitutional theory present.” Therefore, the primary object of Part III of the Constitution was to forge a new relationship between the citizens and the State, which was the new site of Governmental power. The realm of interaction between 85 citizens inter-se, was governed by common law prior to the enactment of the Constitution and continued to be so governed even after the commencement of the Constitution because as recognised hereinabove, the common rights and remedies were not obliterated even after the Constitution was enacted. These inalienable rights, although subsequently placed in Part III of the Constitution, retained their identity in the arena of common law and continued to regulate relationships between citizens and entities, other than the State or its instrumentalities. It is therefore observed that the incidence of the duty to respect Constitutional and Fundamental Rights of citizens is on the State and the Constitution provides remedies against violation of Fundamental Rights by the State. These observations are in consonance with the recognition by this Court in People’s Union for Civil Liberties vs. Union of India, (2005) 2 SCC 436 (“People’s Union for Civil Liberties”) that the objective of Part III is to place citizens at centre stage and make the state accountable to them. 41. On the other hand, common law rights, regulate the relationship between citizens inter-se. Although the content of a common law right may be similar to a Fundamental Right, the two rights are distinct in so far as, the incidence of duty to respect a common law right is on citizens or entities other than State or its instrumentalities; while the incidence of duty to respect a Fundamental Right, except where expressly otherwise provided, is on the State. Remedies against violation of 86 Fundamental Rights by the State are Constitutionally prescribed under Articles 32 and 226; while common law remedies, some of which are statutorily recognised, are available against violation of common law rights. Such remedies are available even as against fellow citizens or entities other than State or its instrumentalities. To this extent, horizontality is recognised in common law. Further to some extent certain Fundamental Rights are recognised statutorily and some others are expressly recognised in the Constitution as being applicable as horizontal rights between citizens inter se such as Articles 15(2), 17, 23, 24. A similar declaration as regards the right to privacy is found in the decision of this Court in Puttaswamy. The relevant excerpts from the said decision have been reproduced hereinunder: “253. Once we have arrived at this understanding of the nature of fundamental rights, we can dismantle a core assumption of the Union's argument: that a right must either be a common law right or a fundamental right. The only material distinctions between the two classes of right - of which the nature and content may be the same - lie in the incidence of the duty to respect the right and in the forum in which a failure to do so can be redressed. Common law rights are horizontal in their operation when they are violated by one's fellow man, he can be named and proceeded against in an ordinary court of law. Constitutional and fundamental rights, on the other hand, provide remedy against the violation of a valued interest by the 'state', as an abstract entity, whether through legislation or otherwise, as well as by identifiable public officials, being individuals clothed with the powers of the state. It is perfectly possible for an interest to simultaneously be recognized as a common law right and a fundamental right. Where the interference with a recognized interest is by the state or any other like entity recognized by Article 87 12, a claim for the violation of a fundamental right would lie. Where the author of an identical interference is a non-state actor, an action at common law would lie in an ordinary court. 254. Privacy has the nature of being both a common law right as well as a fundamental right. Its content, in both forms, is identical. All that differs is the incidence of burden and the forum for enforcement for each form.” [Emphasis by me] It has therefore been unequivocally declared by this Court that while the content of a right recognised under Part III of the Constitution may coincide or overlap with a common law right, the remedies available against violation of the respective form of right, operate in different spheres of law. That is, although the content of a common law right and a fundamental right may be almost identical, the remedy against violation of a common law right, shall lie under common law and not under the Constitution; similarly, the remedy against violation of a Fundamental Right is provided for under the Constitution itself expressly against the State under Article 19(2) thereof. 42. The status of the violator of the right, is also an essential parameter for distinction between the two rights and corresponding remedies. Where the interference with a recognized right is by the State or any other entity recognized under Article 12, a claim for the violation of a fundamental right would lie under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution before this Court or before the High Court respectively. Where interference is by an entity other than State or its 88 instrumentalities, an action would lie under common law and to such extent, the legal scheme recognises horizontal operation of such rights. 43. Though the content of the Fundamental Right may be identical under the Constitution with the common law right, it is only the common law right that operates horizontally except when those Fundamental Rights have been transformed into statutory rights under specific enactments or where horizontal operation has been expressly recognised under the Constitution. This is because, the following difficulties would surface if the Fundamental Rights enshrined under Article 19 and 21 are permitted to operate horizontally so as to seek the remedy by way of a writ petition before a Constitutional Court: i) No recognition that Fundamental Rights enshrined under Article 19 and 21 are permitted to operate horizontally can be made except by ignoring the elementary differences between a Fundamental Right and the congruent common law right. Such a recognition could proceed only by ignoring the fact that the incidence of the duty to respect a Fundamental Right is on the State and its instrumentalities. Recognition of horizontal enforceability of Fundamental Rights would also ignore the status of the violator of the right except when a Fundamental Right is also recognised as a statutory right against another person or citizen. Therefore, such a recognition is misplaced as it proceeds with total disregard to the elementary differences in status of the two forms of rights, incidence of duty to respect each of such forms of rights, and the 89 forum which would be called upon to adjudicate on the failure to respect each of such rights. ii) The following decisions of this Court are demonstrative of its disinclination or reluctance in recognising that Fundamental Rights enshrined under Article 19 and 21 are permitted to operate horizontally: a) In P.D. Shamdasani vs. Central Bank of India Ltd., A.I.R. 1952 SC 59, a Constitution Bench of this Court refused to entertain a Writ Petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, wherein a prayer was made to enforce the right under Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31(1), as they then stood, against a private entity. In that context, it was held that the language and structure of Article 19 and its setting in Part III of the Constitution clearly show that the Article was intended to protect those freedoms against State action. This Court declared that violation of rights of property by individuals or entities other than the State and its instrumentalities, was not within the purview of Article 19(1)(f). Further, this Court made a comparison between Article 31(1), as it then stood, and Article 21 as both Articles cast a negative duty on the State. In that context it was held that although there is no express reference to the State in Article 21, it could not be suggested that the Article was intended to 90 afford protection to life and liberty against violation by private individuals. That the words “except by procedure established by law” exclude such suggestion that Article 21 would operate horizontally. The aforesaid decision is illustrative of this Court’s reluctance to hold that the Fundamental Rights under Articles 19 or 21 of the Constitution, would operate horizontally. It is also to be noted that in the aforesaid case, this Court has acknowledged that a suitable remedy exists under statutory law to redress the infraction complained of. Therefore, while this Court was mindful that the rights in the realm of common law, some of which have gained statutory recognition, operate horizontally, the Fundamental Rights under Articles 19 and 21, do not, except in the case of seeking a writ in the nature of habeas corpus. (b) In Zoroastrian Cooperative Housing Society Limited vs. District Registrar, Cooperative Societies (Urban), (2005) 5 SCC 632, the Petitioner society was a registered society with its own bye-laws, under its parent legislation, the Bombay Cooperative Societies Act. As per bye-law 7, only members of the Parsi community were eligible to become members of the Society. The effect of this was that since housing shares could be transferred only to members, effectively, only Parsis could 91 buy plots under the aegis of the Cooperative Society. This restrictive covenant in the bye-laws became the subject matter of challenge before this Court, inter-alia, on the ground that it violated the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution. This Court refused to accept such a challenge and held that the Society’s bye-laws were in the nature of Articles of Association of a company and were not like a statute. The bye- laws were only “binding between the persons affected by them.” That a private contractual agreement is not subject to general scrutiny under Part III of the Constitution. This Court further distinguished between a discriminatory legislation passed by the State and a discriminatory bye-laws of a society or association, which is not ‘State’. Accordingly, it held that while a legislation may be subject to a challenge on the touchstone of Part III of the Constitution, bye-laws of a society or association, could not. This decision is also demonstrative of this Court’s disapproval of horizontal operation of fundamental rights, making them directly applicable to interactions, whether contractual or otherwise, between private parties. iii) I am however mindful of the fact that over the years, the conception of “State” as defined under Article 12 of the Constitution has undergone significant metamorphosis. 92 Through its jurisprudential labour, this Court has devised several principles and doctrines, so as to enable citizens to enforce their fundamental rights not only against “State” as defined in the strict sense to mean “agency of the Government,” but also against entities imbued with public character, or entitles which perform functions which closely resemble governmental functions. [See: Pradeep Kumar Biswas vs. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, (2002) 5 SCC 111; Zee Telefilms Ltd. vs. Union of India, (2005) 4 SCC 649; Janet Jeyapaul vs. S.R.M. University, (2015) 16 SCC 530] This Court has progressively expanded the scope of Article 12 of the Constitution so as to ensure that a private entity, which performs a public duty/function and therefore informs our national life, does not get away scott-free merely because it is not “State” stricto sensu. Such entitles are imbued with constitutional obligations on account of the public or statutory functions performed by them. At this juncture, it is necessary to reflect on the difference between holding that Fundamental Rights may be enforced against a private entity on account of the public nature of its functions, as contrasted with universal operation of fundamental rights claims against all persons. A private body, acting in private capacity, fulfilling a private 93 function, cannot be axiomatically amenable to the claims of fundamental rights violations. The decision of this Court in Ramakrishna Mission vs. Kago Kunya, (2019) 16 SCC 303 is also highly instructive on the issue of amenability of actions of private entities, to judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In the said case, the issue before this Court was whether the Hospital run by the Petitioner Mission performed a public function that made it amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article 226. This Court found that the Hospital and the Mission were not amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 since running a hospital would not constitute a public function. This Court further highlighted that even when a private entity performs a public function, the Court would be required to enquire as to whether the grant in aid received by the said entity covers a significant portion of its expenditure. This Court went on to declare that regulation of a private body by a statute does not give it the colour of a public function. A public function was held to be one which is “closely related to functions which are performed by the State in its sovereign capacity.” Accordingly, it was held that the Hospital was not performing a public function since the functions it performed were not “akin to those solely performed by State authorities.” It was 94 held that medical services were provided by private as well as State entities and therefore, the nature of medical services was not such that they could be carried out solely by State authorities. Thus, according to the decision of this Court in Ramakrishna Mission, regulation by the State either through a statute or otherwise; receipt of a meagre amount of aid from the State; receipt of concessions by the State; do not make a private entity amenable to the writ jurisdiction of Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution. Thus, recognising a horizontal approach of Fundamental Rights between citizens inter se would set at naught and render redundant, all the tests and doctrines forged by this Court to identify “State” for the purpose of entertaining claims of fundamental rights violations. Had the intention of this Court been to allow Fundamental Rights, including the rights under Articles 19 and 21, to operate horizontally, this Court would not have engaged in evolving and refining tests to determine the true meaning and scope of “State” as defined under Article 12. This Court would have simply entertained claims of fundamental rights violations against all persons and entities, without deliberating on fundamental questions as to maintainability of the writ petitions. Although this Court has 95 significantly expanded the scope of “State” as defined under Article 12, such expansion is based on considerations such as the nature of functions performed by the entity in question and the degree of control exercised over it by the State as such. This is significantly different from recognising horizontality of the fundamental rights under Articles 19 and 21, except while seeking a writ in the nature of habeas corpus. Such a recognition would amount to disregarding the jurisprudence evolved by this Court as to the scope of Article 12 of the Constitution. iv) Another aspect that needs consideration is that a Writ Court, does not ordinarily adjudicate to issue Writs in cases where alternate and efficacious remedies exist under common law or statutory law particularly against private persons. Therefore, even if horizontal operation of the Fundamental Rights under Article 19/21 is recognised, such recognition would be of no avail because the claim before a Writ Court of fundamental rights violations would fail on the ground that the congruent common law right which is identical in content to the Fundamental Right, may be enforced by having recourse to common law remedies. Therefore, on the ground that there exists an alternate and efficacious remedy in common law, the 96 horizontal claim for fundamental rights violations would fail before a Writ Court. This may be better understood by way of an illustration. Let me assume for the purpose of argument that the Fundamental Right under Article 19(1)(a) read with Article 21 is allowed to operate horizontally. A person would then be eligible to file a writ petition, against another private individual or entity for violation of such right. The violation may for instance be a verbal attack at the aggrieved person, which may have the effect of undermining such person’s dignity or reputation. Dignity and reputation are essential facets of the right to life under Article 21; at the same time, they are also recognised as common law rights as they are fundamental attributes of human personality which is regarded as a supreme value in common law. Common law remedies, including declarations, injunctions and damages, are available to redress any injury to common law rights, including the right to dignity and reputation. Such remedies are also statutorily recognised under the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and the Indian Penal Code. Therefore, on account of availability of an alternate remedy under common law, the Courts would be reluctant to entertain a writ petition under Articles 226 or 32, as the case may be. 97 v) Further, it is trite that Writ Courts do not enter into adjudication of disputed questions of fact. But, questions regarding infringement of the fundamental rights under Article 19/21, by a private entity, would invariably involve disputed questions of fact. Therefore, this is another difficulty that must be borne in mind while determining the horizontal operation of such rights in a writ proceeding. However, there is another aspect of the matter that requires to be discussed. A writ of habeas corpus is an order directing the person who has detained another to produce the detainee before the court in order for the court to ascertain on what ground or for what reason he has been confined, and to release him if there is no legal justification for the detention. A writ of habeas corpus is granted ex debito justiae and the applicant must only demonstrate prima-facie, unlawful detention of himself or any other person. If there is no justification for the detention and the same is unlawful, a writ is issued as of right vide Union of India vs. Paul Manickam, (2003) 8 SCC 342. The importance of a writ of habeas corpus is the duty being cast on a Constitutional Court to issue the writ to safeguard the freedom of a citizen against illegal and arbitrary detention. In my humble view, an illegal detention is a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, irrespective of whether the detention is by the State or by a private person. 98 A petition under Article 226 of the Constitution would therefore lie before the High Court, not only when the person has been detained by the State but also when he/she is detained by a private individual vide Mohd. Ikram Hussain vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, A.I.R. 1964 SC 1625 at 1630. In my view, such a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution would also lie before this Court for seeking a writ of habeas corpus in terms of Article 32 (2). Such a writ could be issued not just against the State which may have illegally detained a person, but even as against a private person. Hence, in the context of illegal detention, Article 21 would operate horizontally against private persons also. Such a departure has to be made although Fundamental Rights are normally enforced against the State under Article 32 of the Constitution. Otherwise, the remedy by way of a writ of habeas corpus would be rendered incomplete if the said remedy is not available against a private person under Article 32 of the Constitution. Hence in the context of illegal detention, even by a private person, I would opine that Article 21 would operate horizontally and the writ of habeas corpus could be issued against a private person just as under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court can issue such a writ against any person or authority. But even in the context of Article 32(2) of the Constitution, it may not be proper to restrict the said remedy only as against the State but the same may be made available even as against private persons, in which event the power exercised by this Court could be in accordance 99 with Article 142 (1) of the Constitution to do complete justice in the matter. For ease of reference Article 142(1) may be extracted as under: vi) “142. Enforcement of decrees and orders of Supreme Court and unless as to discovery, etc. - ( 1 ) The Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, and any decree so passed or orders so made shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in such manner as may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament and, until provision in that behalf is so made, in such manner as the President may by order prescribe.” Therefore, a writ of habeas corpus could be issued by this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, not only against the ‘State’ as defined under Article 12 of the Constitution but also against a private individual. This is because illegal detention by a private person is a tort and of a nature similar to a constitutional tort. The reason for saying so is because an illegal detention whether by a State or a private person has a direct and identical effect on the detainee. The detainee loses his liberty and there may be a threat to his life. Directions in the nature of writs of habeas corpus have been issued by this Court on previous occasions, against private individuals, particularly in cases of kidnapping, child custody etc. [See for instance: Nirmaljit Kaur (2) vs. State of Punjab, (2006) 9 SCC 364] In such cases, resorting to the process of instituting a criminal case before a police station, may prove to be futile because the need of the hour in such cases is swift action. The writ of habeas corpus under Article 226 100 as well as Article 32 of the Constitution, is festium remidium, i.e., a speedy remedy, and such remedy needs to be made available even as against a private individual. It is appropriate that the High Court concerned under whose jurisdiction the illegal detention has occurred should be approached first. In order to invoke jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution by approaching this Court directly, it has to be shown by the Petitioner as to why the concerned High Court has not been approached. In cases where it would be futile to approach the High Court, and where satisfactory reasons are indicated in this regard, a petition seeking issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, may be entertained. However, in the absence of such circumstances, filing a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution is not to be encouraged, vide Union of India vs. Paul Manickam, (2003) 8 SCC 342. The judicial precedent referred to above are aligned with the aforesaid discussion. In light of the aforesaid discussion, Question No. 2 is answered as follows: “The rights in the realm of common law, which may be similar or identical in their content to the Fundamental Rights under Article 19/21, operate horizontally: However, the Fundamental Rights under Articles 19 and 21, may not be justiciable horizontally before the Constitutional Courts except those rights which have been statutorily recognised and in accordance with the applicable law. However, they may be the 101 basis for seeking common law remedies. But a remedy in the form of writ of Habeas Corpus, if sought against a private person on the basis of Article 21 of the Constitution can be before a Constitutional Court i.e., by way of Article 226 before the High Court or Article 32 read with Article 142 before the Supreme Court.” Re: Question No. 3: Whether the State is under a duty to affirmatively protect the rights of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India even against a threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another citizen or private agency? 44. In order to answer this question, it may be prudent to consider the circumstances under which this Court has previously observed that the State is bound to protect the life and liberty of every human being, from the following judgments: i) In Pt. Parmanand Katara vs. Union of India, A.I.R. 1989 SC 2039, this Court was confronted with the question as to whether a doctor has the professional obligation to instantaneously extend his services to a person brought for medical treatment, without any delay on the pretext of compliance with procedural criminal law. This court declared that the obligation of a doctor to extend his services with due expertise, for protecting life was paramount and absolute and any laws of procedure which would interfere with the discharge of this obligation, would be antithetical to Article 21 of the Constitution. It was further observed that where there is delay 102 on the part of medical professionals to administer treatment in emergencies, state action can intervene. ii) In National Human Rights Commission vs. State of Arunachal Pradesh, (1996) 1 SCC 742, this Court considered a writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, pertaining to the threats held out by the All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union, to force Chakmas out of the State of Arunachal Pradesh. It was the case of the Petitioner therein that a large number of Chakmas from erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) were displaced by the Kaptai Hydel Power Project in 1964. They had taken shelter in Assam and Tripura. Most of them were settled in these States and became Indian citizens in due course of time. Since a large number of refugees had taken shelter in Assam, the State Government had expressed its inability to rehabilitate all of them and requested assistance in this regard from certain other States. As a result of such consultations between the North Eastern States, some population of Chakmas began residing in Arunachal Pradesh. It was also stated that many of such persons had made representations for the grant of citizenship under Section 5(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, however, no decision was communicated in this regard. In the interim, relations between citizens residing in Arunachal Pradesh and the Chakmas deteriorated and the latter were being subjected to repressive measures with a view to forcibly expel them from the State. In that background, a writ 103 petition came to be filed, alleging, inter-alia, unwillingness on the part of the State to contain the hostile situation. In that background, this Court issued a writ of mandamus, inter-alia, directing the State of Arunachal Pradesh to ensure that the life and liberty of every Chakma residing in the State is protected, and any attempt by organised groups to evict or drive them out of the State is repelled, if necessary, by requisitioning the service of para- military or police force. It was also directed that the application made by Chakmas for the grant of citizenship under Section 5(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 be considered, and pending such consideration, no Chakma shall be evicted from the State. It is to be noted that in the said case, this Court cited the Fundamental Rights of persons under Article 21 in directing the State to protect the rights of Chakmas from threats by private actors. The said directions were issued in the backdrop of the State’s inaction to mobilise the available machinery to contain the hostile situation and such inaction had or could have had the effect of depriving Chakmas of their right to life and personal liberties. It was in that context that this Court declared that the State is bound to protect the life and liberty of every human being, be he a citizen or otherwise. iii) In Gaurav Kumar Bansal vs. Union of India, (2015) 2 SCC 130, this Court, in directing the respondents therein to provide ex gratia 104 monetary compensation to the families of the deceased who have succumbed to the pandemic of Covid-19, in view of Section 12 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, relied on Article 21 of the Constitution. iv) Similarly, in Swaraj Abhiyan vs. Union of India, (2016) 7 SCC 498, this Court relied on Article 21 of the Constitution, in issuing a writ of mandamus to the Union of India, to effectively implement the National Food Security, 2013 in certain parts of the country which had been affected due to drought. The aforesaid cases illustrate that this Court has observed that the State is bound to protect the life and liberty of every human being, in the following contexts: a) Where inaction on the part of the State, to contain a hostile situation between private actors, could have had the effect of depriving persons of their right to life and liberty; b) Where the State had failed to carry out its obligations under a statute or a policy or scheme, and such failure could have had the effect of depriving persons of their right to life and liberty. c) It is therefore clear that the acknowledgement of this Court of the duty of the State under Article 21, only pertains to a negative duty not to deprive a person of his right to life and personal liberty, except in accordance with law. This Court has not recognised an affirmative duty on the part of the State under Article 21 of the 105 Constitution to protect the rights of a citizen, against a threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another citizen or private agency. Of course, there exist a plethora of statutes which cast an obligation on the State and its machinery to contain hostile situations between private actors; to repel any action by private actors which would undermine the life and liberty of other persons etc. This Court has, on several occasions, issued writs of mandamus directing State authorities to carry out such statutory obligations. In directing so, this Court may have referred to the right to life and personal liberties under Article 21. However, such reference to Article 21 is not to be construed as an acknowledgement by the Court of an affirmative duty on the part of the State under Article 21 of the Constitution to protect the rights of a citizen, against a threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another citizen or private agency. Given that Article 21 only imposes a negative duty, a violation of the same would occur only when the State undertakes an obligation by enacting a statute or a scheme, but does not fulfil it. Thus, the violation will only occur when a scheme has been initiated but is not being appropriately implemented, as was noted in the aforecited cases. In light of the aforesaid discussion, Question No. 3 is answered as follows: 106 “The duty cast upon the State under Article 21 is a negative duty not to deprive a person of his life and personal liberty except in accordance with law. The State has an affirmative duty to carry out obligations cast upon it under statutory and constitutional law, which are based on the Fundamental Right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Such obligations may require interference by the State where acts of a private actor may threaten the life or liberty of another individual. Failure to carry out the duties enjoined upon the State under statutory law to protect the rights of a citizen, could have the effect of depriving a citizen of his right to life and personal liberty. When a citizen is so deprived of his right to life and personal liberties, the State would have breached the negative duty cast upon it under Article 21.” Re: Question No. 4: Can a statement made by a Minister, traceable to any affairs of State or for protecting the Government, be attributed vicariously to the Government itself, especially in view of the principle of Collective Responsibility? 45. A Minster may make statements in two capacities: first, in his personal capacity; second, in his official capacity and as a delegate of the Government. It is a no brainer that in respect of the former category of statements, no vicarious liability may be attributed to the Government itself. The latter category of statements may be traceable to any affair of the State or may be made with a view to protect the Government. If such statements are disparaging or derogatory and represent not only the personal views of the individual Minister making them, but also embody the views of the Government, then, such statements can be 107 attributed vicariously to the Government itself, especially in view of the principle of Collective Responsibility. In other words, if such views are endorsed not only in the statements made by an individual Minister, but are also reflective of the Government’s stance, such statements may be attributed vicariously to the Government. However, if such statements are stray opinions of an individual Minister and are not consistent with the views of the Government, then they shall be attributable to the Minister personally and not to the Government. Therefore, Question No. 4 is answered as follows: “A statement made by a Minister if traceable to any affairs of the State or for protecting the Government, can be attributed vicariously to the Government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility, so long as such statement represents the view of the Government also. If such a statement is not consistent with the view of the Government, then it is attributable to the Minister personally.” Re: Question No. 5: Whether a statement by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen under Part Three of the Constitution, constitutes a violation of such constitutional rights and is actionable as ‘Constitutional Tort’? 46. While public law and private law are in theory, treated as analytically different, in practice, the divide between the two spheres is often blurred. As a result, ideas, concepts and devices from one sphere, influence the other. Such an intermingling has given rise to the doctrine of horizontal effects as discussed hereinabove, wherein a constitutional 108 directive or norm (Fundamental Right) is interpreted by Courts to apply between individuals. 47. Another concept which can be traced to the interaction between public law and private law is that of a Constitutional tort, which in essence attributes vicarious liability on the State for acts and omissions of its agents which result in violation of fundamental rights of an individual or group. A constitutional tort is a violation of one’s constitutional rights, particularly fundamental rights, by an agent of the government, acting in his/her official capacity. The alleged constitutional violation creates a cause of action that is distinct from any other available state tort remedy. It however, carries with it, the essential element of tort law, which seeks to redress a harm or injury by awarding monetary compensation by a competent court of law. Writ Petition: Principles of Procedure 48. Normally the filing of a writ petition invoking Article 32 of the Constitution before the Supreme Court or Article 226 before the High Court is resorted to seeking an extraordinary remedy. The prerogative powers of the High Court are not exercised for enforcement of private rights of the parties but are for the purpose of ensuring that public authorities act within the limits of law. Writ remedy is thus not a private law remedy except writ of habeas corpus. Thus, writ petition would lie against the State including local authorities and other authorities as defined under Article 12 of the Constitution which is an inclusive 109 definition which takes within its scope and ambit all statutory bodies instrumentalities and authorities or persons charged with, or expected to exercise, public functions or discharge public duties. A writ petition may be instituted for the enforcement of any fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution under Article 32 before the Supreme Court but under Article 226 of the Constitution, the jurisdiction of the High Courts is wider than the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court inasmuch as the said Article may be invoked for enforcement of fundamental rights as also “for any other purpose”. Tortious liability: 49. In India, the government can be held liable for tortious acts of its servants and can be ordered to be paid compensation to the persons suffering as a result of the legal wrong. Article 294(b) of the Constitution declares that the liability of the Union Government or the State Government may arise “out of any contract or otherwise”. The word otherwise implies that the said liability may arise for tortious acts as well. Article 300 enables institution of appropriate proceedings against the government for enforcing such liability. 50. Even prior to the commencement of the Constitution, the liability of the Government for tortious acts of its servants or agents were recognised vide Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co. vs. Secy. Of State, (1868-69) 5 Bom HCR APP 1. After the commencement of the Constitution, there have been several cases in which the Union 110 of India and State Governments were held liable for tortious acts of their employees, servants and agents. All those cases were not necessarily by invoking the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Though, the Government is liable for tortious acts of its officers, servants or employees, normally, such liability cannot be enforced by a Writ Court. An aggrieved party has the right to approach the competent court or authority to seek damages or compensation in accordance with the law of the land. 51. But if fundamental rights have been violated, and if the court is satisfied that the grievance of the petitioner is well founded, it may grant the relief by enforcing a person’s fundamental right. Such relief may be in the form of monetary compensation/damages. Instances of such cases are Rudul Sah vs. State of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 141; Sebastian M. Hongray vs. Union of India, (1984) 3 SCC 82; Bhim Singh vs. State of J&K, (1985) 4 SCC 677; People’s Union for Democratic Rights vs. Police Commissioner, (1989) 4 SCC 730; Saheli vs. Commissioner of Police, (1990) 1 SCC 422; State of Maharashtra vs. Ravikant S. Patil, (1991) 2 SCC 373; Kumari vs. State of Tamil Nadu, (1992) 2 SCC 223; Shakuntala Devi vs. Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking, (1995) 2 SCC 369; Tamil Nadu Electricity Board vs. Sumanth, (2000) 4 SCC 543; Railway Board vs. Chandrima Das, (2000) 2 SCC 465. 111 52. Article 21 has played a significant role in shaping the law on tortious liability of the Government. This Court has asserted that the concept of sovereign function, which acts as an exception to attracting tortious liability, ends where Article 21 begins. Therefore, this Court has been willing to defend life and liberty of persons against state lawlessness by holding that where Article 21 is violated, the State has to pay compensation and the concept of sovereign function does not prevail in this area. 53. This proposition may be specifically traced to early PILs, which began in India in the 1980s, primarily in cases where officials of the State, such as prison officials had mistreated prisoners. The focus of the first phase of PIL in India was on exposure of repression by the agencies of the state, notably the police, prison, and other custodial authorities. These early PILs were essentially Constitutional tort actions which concerned allegations of violation of protected fundamental rights, as a result of acts or omissions on the part of officials of the State. Therefore, Constitutional law and tort law came to be merged by this Court under the rubric of PIL, and this Court began allowing successful petitioners to recover monetary damages from the State for infraction of their fundamental rights. In such cases, there may have been statutory rights of persons also which would then be an enunciation of an aspect of Fundamental Rights particularly under Article 21 of the Constitution. 112 54. In Rudul Sah vs. State of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 141, Y.V. Chandrachud, CJ., gave further momentum to fundamental rights to combat state lawlessness by granting cash compensation to a victim of unlawful incarceration for fourteen years. It is to be noticed that His Lordship, in the said case, took note of the dilemma in allowing a litigant to seek damages in a writ petition/PIL action against the State. His Lordship noted that this could have the effect of ordinary civil action being circumvented on a routine basis, by invoking writ jurisdiction of the High Courts and the Supreme Court as an alternative to ordinary civil action. However, it was recognized that granting such remedies would enhance the legitimacy of the vehicle of PIL. Therefore, this Court in Rudul Sah ultimately chose to grant monetary damages, in order to ‘mulct’ the violators, as well as to offer a ‘palliative’ for victims. Subsequent to the decision in Rudul Sah, compensatory relief has been granted as a means to ‘civilize public power’ in several cases involving abrogation of Fundamental Rights, [See for instance, Sabastian M. Hongray vs. Union of India, A.I.R. 1984 SC 1026; Bhim Singh, MLA vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir, A.I.R. 1986 SC 494.] 55. In Nilabati Behera vs. State of Orissa, (1993) 2 SCC 746, this Court observed that the award of compensation in a proceeding under Article 32 or Article 226 of the Constitution is a remedy available in public law based on strict liability for contravention of fundamental rights. In respect of such actions, the doctrine of sovereign immunity 113 does not apply, though it may be available as a defence in a private law in an action based on tort. Drawing a distinction between proceedings under the private and public law, it was observed that a public law proceeding may serve a different purpose than a private law proceeding. Public law proceedings are based on the concept of strict liability for contravention of guarantee basic and indivisible rights of the citizens by the State. The purpose of public law is not only to civilise governmental power and but also to assure the citizens that they live under a legal system which gains to protect their interest and preserve their rights. Therefore, when the court moulds the relief by granting compensation, in proceedings under Article 32 and Article 226 of the Constitution seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights, it does so under public law by way of employing elements of the law of torts and fixing the liability on the State which has been negligent and has failed in its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens. The payment of compensation under such cases is not to be understood as it is generally understood in a civil action for damages under private law, but in the broader sense of providing relief by ordering monetary amounts to be paid for the wrong done due to breach of public duty which would have the effect of violation of fundamental rights of citizens. Such grant of damages in exercise of a writ jurisdiction by the constitutional courts is independent of the rights available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation under private law in an action based on tort. Therefore, a suit may be instituted in a competent court 114 of law or proceedings may be initiated to prosecute the offender under the penal law. 56. Though, in D.K.Basu vs. State of West Bengal, (1997) 1 SCC 416 monetary compensation was granted, in Hindustan Paper Corporation Ltd. vs. Ananta Bhattacharjee, (2004) 6 SCC 213 this Court cautioned that a direction to pay compensation under Article 226 of the Constitution is permissible as a public law remedy and resorted to only when there is a violation by the State or its agents acting in official capacity of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution, and not otherwise. It was further observed that it is not every violation of the provisions of the Constitution or a statute which would enable the court to direct grant of compensation. The power of the court to grant compensation in public law is limited. Therefore, normally in case of tortious liability, the person aggrieved has to approach a civil court for ventilating his grievances and he cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or a High Court. However, if the duty breached is of a public nature or there is violation or breach or infringement of a fundamental right by an act or omission on the part of the authority, it is open to the party who has suffered a “legal wrong” to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or a High Court by instituting the writ petition. In that case, the court, in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction and discretion judiciously may grant relief to the person wronged without relegating him to avail a remedy, 115 otherwise available to him under private law having regard to the facts and circumstances of the particular case. 57. In Chairman, Railway Board vs. Chandrima Das, (2000) 2 SCC 465, this Court was presented with an appeal against an order of the Calcutta High Court in a writ petition filed by a civil rights lawyer on behalf of a foreign national-victim of rape, allegedly committed by railway employees at a government-owned railway station. The events in question happened when the employees were off duty, but were present at the premises owned and operated by the Government (Railways) . The writ petition was filed against the employer, in addition to initiating criminal proceedings against the individuals. A specific prayer was made in the writ petition for monetary compensation for the victim, payable by the Government, alleging that its failure to protect the victim and prevent the crime, had violated the victim’s fundamental right. The High Court awarded a sum of Rs. 10 Lakhs as compensation to the victim of rape, as it was of the opinion that the offence was committed at the building (Rail Yatri Niwas) belonging to the Railways and was perpetrated by the Railway employees. An appeal against the said judgment was preferred before this Court. 58. This Court dismissed the appeal holding that where public functionaries are involved and the matter relates to violation of Fundamental Rights, or the enforcement of public duties, the remedy would be available under public law, notwithstanding that a suit could 116 be filed under private law, for damages. Since the crime of rape amounted to a violation of the victim’s right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution, this Court concluded that a public law remedy was wholly appropriate. 59. The decisions in Rudul Sah and Chandrima Das establish that a public law action seeking monetary compensation for violation of fundamental rights was no longer an action in lieu of a private law claim, but was to serve an independent and more important purpose. However, it cannot be ignored that the decisions of Courts to award compensation in such cases, proceed on the basis of lower evidentiary standards, as noted by this Court in Kumari vs. State of Tamil Nadu, (1992) 2 SCC 223. 60. In Tamil Nadu Electricity Board vs. Sumathi Das, (2000) 4 SCC 543, this Court held that exercise of writ jurisdiction would be inappropriate where there were disputed questions of fact that required proof through substantial evidence. However, it has been clarified that the restriction applied only to the higher judiciary’s writ jurisdiction under Articles 32 and 226, and that it did not restrain this Court’s power to address the matter under Article 142, which allows this Court to pass any order ‘necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter.’ Therefore, this Court has recognised that factual disputes could operate as a limit on the Courts’ ability to treat a matter as being 117 actionable as a Constitutional tort but has nevertheless awarded monetary compensation in certain cases possibly having regard to the glaring facts of those cases by exercising power under Article 142 of the Constitution. 61. Scholarly views suggest that the concept of Constitutional tort challenges the ability of law to deter socially harmful behaviour of different kinds, by forcing the perpetrator to internalise the costs of their actions. However, in case of a Constitutional tort action, the entity saddled with the cost, is not the same as the entity who is to be deterred. This absurdity is stated to be threatening to the corrective justice idea that tort law embodies. In other words, an actor’s direct ability to alter the injury-causing behaviour is critical to the foundation of tort law. However, given that an action of Constitutional tort imposes the burden of damages on an entity, other than the violator of the right, a doubt has been cast on its effectiveness in serving as a vehicle of corrective justice. 62. In light of the aforesaid discussion, it is observed that it is not prudent to treat all cases where a statement made by a public functionary resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, as a constitutional tort. Regard must be had in every case to the nature of resultant harm or loss. Further, it is to be noted that even the cases cited hereinabove have permitted treating an act or omission as a constitutional tort only where there has been an infraction of 118 fundamental right as a direct result of such act or omission. Therefore the causal connection between the act or omission and the resultant infraction of fundamental rights, is central to any determination of an action of constitutional tort. 63. In Delhi Jal Board vs. National Campaign for Dignity & Rights of Sewerage & Allied Workers, (2011) 8 SCC 568, this Court refused to entertain a matter against an interim order passed by the Delhi High Court in a writ petition, whereby the Petitioner Board had been directed to deposit compensation in favour of the family of a sewerage worker who had died while performing his duties. Dismissing the case, this Court held that since the deceased had died due to insensitivity on the part of the State apparatus, to the safety and well- being of its employees, the State would be liable to pay compensation to the family of the deceased. This Court invoked Article 142 of the Constitution to enhance the amount of compensation payable. 64. At this juncture, it may be apposite to sound a word of caution as regards the approach of the Courts in granting monetary compensation as a means for vindication of fundamental rights. It is to be noted that in the absence of a clear, cogent and comprehensive legal framework based on judicial precedent, which would clarify what harm or injury is actionable as a constitutional tort, such a device is to be resorted to only in cases where there are brutal violations of fundamental rights, such as the violations that were involved in Rudul 119 Sah and Chandrima Das. This Court has acknowledged such a view in Sebastian M. Hongray, by noting that compensation was being awarded in the said case having regard to “torture, the agony and the mental oppression” which the family of the victim therein had to endure due his death by an encounter. Similarly, this Court, in Bhim Singh stated that the compensation was awarded by taking note of the “bizzare acts” of police lawlessness. As already highlighted, compensation was awarded in Delhi Jal Board, by exercising power under Article 142. Thus, the remedy provided is on a case to case basis on an evolution of the concept of constitutional tort through judicial dicta. 65. While it is true that the Courts must mould their tools to deal with particularly extreme and threatening situations, and the device of a ‘constitutional tort’ has evolved through such an exercise, it must be borne in mind that the tool of treating an action as a constitutional tort must not be wielded only in instances wherein state lawlessness and indifference to the right to life and personal liberties have caused immense suffering. The law would have to evolve in this regard, in respect of violation of other Fundamental Rights apart from issuance of the prerogative writs. 66. Therefore, it is observed that presently invocation of writ jurisdiction to grant damages, by treating acts and omissions of agencies of the State as Constitutional torts, must be an exception 120 rather than a rule. The remedy before a competent court or under criminal law is, in any case available as per the existing legal framework. In light of the aforesaid discussion, Question No. 5 is answered as follows: “A proper legal framework is necessary to define the acts or omissions which would amount to constitutional tort and the manner in which the same would be redressed or remedied on the basis of judicial precedent. Particularly, it is not prudent to treat all cases where a statement made by a public functionary resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, as a constitutional tort, except in the context of the answer given to Question No. 4 above.” 67. In light of the above discussion as well as the answers given to the questions referred, the following other conclusions are drawn: a) It is for the Parliament in its wisdom to enact a legislation or code to restrain, citizens in general and public functionaries, in particular, from making disparaging or vitriolic remarks against fellow citizens, having regard to the strict parameters of Article 19(2) and bearing in mind the freedom under Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution of India. Hence, I am not inclined to issue any guideline in this regard, but the observations made hereinabove may be borne in mind. b) It is also for the respective political parties to regulate and control the actions and speech of its functionaries and members. This could be through enactment of a Code of Conduct which would prescribe 121 the limits of permissible speech by functionaries and members of the respective political parties. c) Any citizen, who is prejudiced by any form of attack, as a result of speech/expression through any medium, targeted against her/him or by speech which constitutes ‘hate speech’ or any species thereof, whether such attack or speech is by a public functionary or otherwise, may approach the Court of Law under Criminal and Civil statutes and seek appropriate remedies. Whenever permissible, civil remedies in the nature of declaratory remedies, injunctions as well as pecuniary damages may be awarded as prescribed under the relevant statutes. However, answers given to Question Nos. 4 and 5 may have a bearing in the context of collective responsibility of government and Constitutional tort. Writ Petition (Crl.) No.113 of 2016 and Special Leave Petition (Civil) bearing Diary No.34629 of 2017 are directed to be listed before an appropriate Bench after seeking orders of Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India. …………..….………J.
