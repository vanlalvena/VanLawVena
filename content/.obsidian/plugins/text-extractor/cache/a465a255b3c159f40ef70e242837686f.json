The deceased Ajaib Singh had two sons, Dalbir Singh and Amir Singh. Dalbir Singh along with his wife Mrs. Dalbir Kaur and Mrs. Dalbir Kaur's brother Ajit Singh and her cousin, Puraon Singh were charged with having committed the murder of Ajaib Singh and Amir Singh. A partition had taken place between Ajaib Singh, Dalbir Singh and Amir Singh. After the partition Dalbir Singh separated and lived in a separate portion of the same house wherea.s Ajaib Singh and Amir Singh lived jointly. Mrs. Jaswant Kaur, the wife of Amir Singh had delivered a child and, therefore, her mother Shiv Kaur was in the house to look after Jaswant Kaur and the child. As the newly born child was not well, both Jaswant Kaur and her mother were awake at that time and electric bulb was burning in the courtyard. Ajaib Singh was sleeping near the stable outside the house and Amir Singh was sleeping in the house. All the male appellants were armed with kirpans and Mis. Dalbir Kaur was armed with datar. They went to the house of Ajaib Singh at about 1.00 A.M. Dalbir Singh had altercation with his father Ajaib Singh and expressed his dissatisfaction over the partition of the lands and asked his father and brother to get ready to meet the consequences and to call anybody for help if they liked. Thereupon Dalbir Singh gave a kirpan blow on the left jaw of Ajaib Singh and Mrs. Dalbir Kaur gave a datar blow on his right shoulder while Ajit Singh and Puran Singh gave kirpa·n blows on his chest. Thereafter, the appellants proceeded to the cot of Amir Singh who was caught hold of by Dalbir Singh and Puran Singh. Ajit Singh gave a kirpan blow on his right leg while Mrs. Dalbir Singh gave a datar blow on his left shoulder. Da·lbir Singh and Puran Singh thereafter dragged Amir Singh and put him over the body of Ajaib Singh and thereafter all the appel- lants caused further injuries to Amir Singh and Ajaib Singh. Both of them died on the spot. J aswant Kaur and Shiv Kaur raised alarm but they were threatened to keep quiet a6 a result of which those two helpless ladies shut themselves up in one of the rooms. Some time early morning the appellants left the house. Jaswant Kaur narrated the incident to Mukhtiar Singh and Mohinder Singh and ultimately left with Mohinder Singh and lodged the first information report at the police station which is about six miles awa~ at 9.00 a.m. The Sessions Court convicted the appellants under s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced the male appellants to death sentence and to the female appellant to imprisonment for life. In a-ppeals and confirmation pro- ceedings, the High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court. In an appeal by special leave, the appellants contended : 1. Since the special leave is granted, the appellants are entitled to argue H a-11 the questions of law and facts. 2. The only eye-witnesses, namely, Mrs. Jaswant Kaur and Mrs. Shiv Kaur are the interested witnesses and, therefore, their evidence should not be accepted. \\ !D!l.LBIR KAUR V. l'UNJAB 2 81 3. No indepeadent witness has been examined to prove the recoveries. 4. There was no evidence of motive for the murder. 5.

HELD : ( 1) The principles governing interference by this Court in a criminal appeal by special leave were summarised as follows : (l) • (2) That this Court would not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact based on pure appreciation of evidence even if it were to take a different view on the evidence; That the Court will not normally enter into a reappraisement or review of the evidence, unless the assessment of the High Court is vitiated by an error of Jaw or procedure or is based on error of record, misreading of evidence or is inconsistent with the evidence, for instance, where the ocular evidence is totally incon· sistent with the medical evidence and so on; '(3 )' That the Court :would not enter into credibility of the evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion for that of the High Court; {4) That the Court would interfere where the High Court has arrived at a finding of fact in disregard of a judicial process, .principles of natural jnstice w a fair hearing or has acted in violation of a mandatory provision of law or procedure resulting in serious pre· judice or injustice to the accused; ( 5) This Court might also interfere where on the proved facts wrong inferences of law have been drawn or where the conclusions of the High Court are manifestly perverse and based on no evid- dence.

(2) Since the incident took pla<:e at midnight inside the house the onlv natural witnesses who could be present to see the ·assault would be Jaswant H Kaur and her mother. The dose relative who· is a very natural witness cannot be regarded as an interested . witness. The term \"interested witness\" postulates that the person concerned must have some ·direct interest in seeing that the A B C_, D_ E F G H 2 82.

The evidence of these witnesses cannot be rejected merely on the grounct that they were relatives of the deceased. They have given a graphic description of what they saw. There is no reason to ·discard the assessment of both the courts below about these two witnesses. There is circumstantial evidence to support the intrinsic evidence given by these two witnesses. They . 'are the extract from the . birth register proving the birth of the son to Mrs'. Jaswant Kaur. The electi'icity fitting in the house and <1 bulb in the courtyard is proved from the ·sketch map and the photograph. [294 G-H, 295 A_:_E] (3) In the instant case. th.e witnesses watched ihe. occ~rrence from a close distance in electric light.· The assanlt was so disas(erous and grnesome that it must have made a·.definite and lasting iinpact on the memory of the wit- nesses. Human· memory is like a memory which takes. snap. shorts of striking incident and then transmits the same through the weirds of mouth faithfully with absolute accuracy and precision .. In view of the . electt·ic bulb burning and since the accused w.ere fully known to the informant Jaswant Kaur,. there is nothing unusual if she gave the names and parentage of all the a·~cused· persons in the F.I.R, [302 G-H, 303-A] . ( 4) The weapons recovered are blood stained and were recovned at the instance of the appellants. Both the courts below have accepted the evidence· of recovery. 29.6 [A-CJ Nachhettar Singh & Others v. State of Punjab A.I.R. 1976 S.C. 351, distin- guished. (5) The partition with which Dalbir Singh was not satisfied was the motive for the murder. Both the courts below have found this to be the motive. fa a·ny case, the High Court also confirmed the finding that ,even ,if there was. no motive, the offence has been established by the ·evidence of the eye- witnesses. [297 A-F] · · ( 6) In the prese1it case, 'four witnesses were 'not examined because two of them· were relatives of Da·lbir Singh and two were won over by the accused according to the prosecution and were not likely to speak the truth and they were present in the court. ·Moreover, in the present case there are two inde- pendent witnesses who are corroborated by the medical evidence and the- evidence of the. recovery o.f the weapons at the instance. oLthe appellants them- selves. The fact of non-examination of Mohinder Singh is imma,terial because the question of bulb was. a minor .matter. Non-examination of Mohinder Singh would not out-weigh the evidence given by the eye-witnesses corroborated by the sketch and photographs. [297-H, 298 A-H, 299 A-El Saliai Ram v. State of U.P.

No such applica.tion was ever made by the appellants either before the trial court or before the High Court. Such an application is made here for the first time which is rejected since this Court in special jurisdiction does not enter-· tain such application .. [300 F-H, 301-A] (7) There was no delay in lodging the F.l.R. after the grnesome murder. Mrs. Jaswant Kaur and Mrs. Shiv Kaur were threatened by the accused as a DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB: (Gitota. J.) 283 · •esult of which they had to shut .themselves in the room and it was only at · .6 a.m .. that Mrs. Jaswant Kaur accompanied by Mohinder Singh started for the . .POiice sta•tion and Jcidged the first information report at 9 a.m. The police station being at a distance of six miles the informant who is a woman could no nin to the police station at night and take the risk of being killed by the .accused who had stayed on in their part of the house even after the .occurrence. The delay in the despatch Qf the f.l.R. to the magistra•te has been clearly explained by the sub inspector who deposed that he had gone to the Magistrate's .court but as the Magistrate was not in his seat, he proceeded to Gurdaspur to give a copy of the first information report to Superintendent of Police and .after his return he delivered the FIR to the Magistrnte at 3 p.m. Both ·the courts below have believed the evidence of the sub inspector which is supported by documents. [301 F-H, 302 A-BJ (8) So far as Ajit Singh is concerned, the testimony is of a single witness, Jaswant Kaur. It is difficult to rely on the evidence of Shiv Kaur. So far as Ajit Singh is concerned although the evidence of Jaswant Kaur is not dis~ trusted, the possibility of her making an honest mistake in identifying Ajit .Singh ca,nnot be safely excluded or rnled out. Ajit Singh gave an application praying for a test identification parade on the ground that he had never gone to the village at the time of the occurrence but at the identification parade Jaswant Kaur was not asked to identify him. Jaswimt Kaur could not have known appellant Ajit Singh very well. The prosecution ought to have produced Jaswant Kaur also at the test identification parade to identify Ajit Singh. It is unsafe to rely on the single testimony of Jaswa,nt Kaur. Therefore, he was given benefit of doubt. For the remaining appellants the conviction and sentence upheld. [303G-H, 304 A-G] A. C.

Frank Anthony and Harjinder Singh, for the appellants in both the appeals. F 0. P. Sharma, for the respondent in both the appeals. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Fazal Ali, J. Gupta, J. gave a separate opinion. · GUPTA, J.-I agree with Iily learned brother that the appeals of Dalbir Singh, Puran Singh and Smt. Dalbir Kaur alias Bhiro should G be dismissed. The Judgment of the High Court which affirms the order .of conviction and the sentences passed on these appellants by the tnal court does not appear to suffer from any infirmity which can be said to have caused a failure of justice so far as the cases of tl:ese appellants are concerned. I also agree that the appeal of Ajit Smgh should be allowed for the reasons stated in the Judgment of my learned brother. II The decisions of this Court referred to in the Judgment of my learned brother lay down that this Court does not interfere with the A B c D E F G H 284 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1977) 1 S.C.R. findings of fact unless it is shown that \"substantial and grave injustice has been done\". But whether such injustice has been done in a given case depends on the circumstances of the case, and I do not think one could catalogue exhaustively all possible circumstances in which it can be said that there has been grave and substantial injustice done in any case. In the appeals before us the findings recorded by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court do not disclose any such e.\"\\Ceptional and special circumstances as would justify the claim made on behalf of the appellants whose appeals we propose to dismiss that there has been a failure of justice in these cases. FAZAL ALI, J.-These two appeals by special leave arc directed against the judgment of the Punjab & Haryana High Court dated March JO, 1975, upholding the convictions and sentences imposed on the appellants by the Trial Court of Sessions Judge, Gurdaspur. The two appeals arise out of the same judgment and, therefore, will be dealt with by us by one common judgment. Criminal Appeal No. 232 of 1975 has been filed by Smt. Dalbir Kaur (ifJ Bhiro, Pura11 Singh and Ajit Singh, while Criminal Appeal No. 373 of 1975 lias been filed by Dalbir Singh. The Sessions Judge convicted all the appellants under ss. 302/34 I.P.C. and sentenced Dalbir Singh, Puran Singh and Ajit Singh to death and Dalbir Kaur to imprisonment for life. The convictions and sentences passed by the Sessions Judge were upheld by the :f!igh Court. The High Court refused to grant certi- ficate for leave to appeal to Supreme Court and thereafter on an application made to this Court special leave was granted. Two q_uestions arise in these appeals : ( 1) Can this Court in a criminal appeal by special leave enter into a fresh review or reappraisement of the evidence and examine the question of credibility of witnesses where the two Courts have concurrently found that the prosecution case against the appellants has been proved; and (2) Is it open to the appellant, once special leave is granted, to argue on questions of fact at the hearing, or i:> he required to confine his arguments only to the points on which special leave could be granted. Not that these points are not covered by authorities but in spite of a catena of decisions of this Court laying down the various principles from time to time over two decades· and a half counsel for the parties have been insisting upon this Court to go into the questions of fact in order to examine whethe_r the judgment of the High Court is correct. I would, therefore, like to review the decisions of this Court on the two points mentioned above so as to clarify the position and settle the controversy once for all. As to the principles on which special leave is granted by this Court, the same have. been clearly and explicitly enunciated in a large number of decisions of this Court. It has been pointed out that the Supreme Court is not an ordinary Court of criminal appeal and does not inter- \\ I • DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fazal Ali, !.) 285 fere on pure questions of fact. It is only in very special cases where the Court is satisfied that the High Court has committed an error oi law or procedure as a result of which there has been a serious· mis- carriage of justice that the Court would in!erfere with the concurrent findings of the High Court and the Trial Court. It has also been pointed out by this Court more than once that it is not in the province of this Court to reappraise the evidence and to go into the question of credibility of the witnesses examined by the parties, .particularly when the Courts below has, after considering the evidence, given their find- ings thereon. In other words, the assessment of the ~vidence by the High Court would be taken by this Court as final, unless it is vitiated by any error of law or procedure, by the principles of natural justice, by errors of record or misreading of evidence, non-consideration of glaring inconsistencies in the evidence which demolish the prosecution case or where the conclusion of the High Court is manifestly perverse and unsupportable and the like. As early as 1950 this Court in Pritam Singh v. The State(') speaking through Fazal Ali, J., (as he then was) observed as follows : \"The obvious reply to all these arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant, is that this Court is not an ordinary Court of criminal appeal and will not, generally speaking, allow facts to· be reopened, especially when two Courts agree in their conclusion in regard to them and when tile conclusions of ·fact which are challenged are dependent on the credibility of witnesses who have been believed by the trial Court which had the advantage of seeing them and hear- ing their evidence.\" \"In arguing the appeal, Mr. Sethi proceeded on the assumption that once an appeal had been admitted by special leave, the entire case was at large and the appellant was free to contest all the findings of fact and raise every point which could be raised in the High Court or the trial Court. This assumption is, in our opinion, entirely unwarranted.\" \"The rule laid down by the Privy Council is based on sound principle, and, in our opinion, only those points can be urged at the Jina! hearing of the appeal which are lit to be urged at the preliminary stage when leave to appeal is asked for, and it would be illogical to adopt different stand- ards at two different stages of the same. case.\" · On a careful examination of article 136 along with the preceding article, it seeJilS clear that the wide discretionary power with which tliis Court is invested under it is to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases only, ........ \" Generally speaking, this Court will not grant special leave, unless it is shown that exceptional and special circums- tances exist, that substantial and grave injustice has been done and that the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against.\" (l' [1950] S.C.R. 453. A B c D E· f G H 286 SUPREME COURT REPORTS. [1977] 1 S.C.R. A Analysing this. decision, two principles appear to have been clearly . laid down by this Court. : . B c D E F G ( 1) that in appeals. by special leave against the concurrent findings of the Courts below, this Court would not go into the credibility of the evidence and would inter- fere only when exceptional and special circumstances exist which result in substantial and grave- injustice having bee1i done to the accused; and (2) that even after special leave has been granted the appellant is not free to contest all the findings of fact, but his arguments would be limited only to those points, even at the final hearing, which could be urged at the stage when the special leave to appeal is asked for. This case was followed by another Bench decision of this Court a little later in Mohinder Singh v. The State(') where this Court observed thus : \"This Court, as was pointed out in Pritmii Singh v. Th'! State (1950) SCR 453-will not entertain a criminal appeal except in special and exceptional cases where it is manifest that by a disregard of the forms of legal process or by a violation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise substantial and grave injustice has been done.\" In Hem Raj v. The State of Ajmer,.(2) the same principle was reite- rated by Mahajan C.J., spea]<ing for the Court, where it was observed thus : \"Unless it is shown that exceptional and special circum- stances exist that substantial and grave injusice has been done and the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against, this Court does not exercise its overriding powers under article 136( 1) of the Constitution and the circumstance that because the appeal, has been admitted by special leave does not entitle the appeJlant to open out the whole case and con- test all the findings of fact and raise every point which could be raised in the High Court. Even at the final hear- ing only those points can ,be urged which are fit to be urged at the preliminary stage when the leave to appeal is asked for.\" Jn Khacheru Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh( 8 ) it was pointed out that this. Court does not interfere with the findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below, unless something substantial has been shown to persuade this Court to go behind the findings of fact. Imam, J. who H spoke for the Court observed as follows : (1) [1950] S.C.R. 821. (2) [1954] S.C.R. 1133, (3) A.LR. [1956] S.C. 5 46. \\ DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fazal Ali, J.) \"In an appeal by way of special leave this Court usually does not interfere with the findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below and nothing substantial has been shown to per- suade us to go behind the findings of faot arrived at by them.\" 287 In Saravanabhavan v. State of Madras('), Hidayatullah, J., (as he A then was) speaking for the majority crystallised and reiterated the B principles already laid down by this Court on previous occasions and observed as follows : \"No doubt this Court has granted special leave to the appellants but the question is one of the principles which th.is Court will ordinarily follow in such an appeal. It has been ruled in many cases before that this Court will not reassess the evidence at large, particularly when it has been concurrently accepted by the High Court and the court or courts below. In other words this Court does not form a fresh opinion as to the innocence or the guilt of the accused. It accepts the appraisal of the evidence in the High Court and the court or courts below. Therefore, before this Court interferes something- more must be shown, such as, that there has been in the trial a violation of the principles of natural justice or a deprivation of the rights of the ,accused or a misreading of vital evidence or an improper reception or rejection of evidence which, if ,discarded or receiVied, would leave the conviction unsupportable, or that the court or courts have committed an error of law or of the forms of legal process or procedure by which justice itself has failed. We have, in approaching this case, borne these principles in mind. They are the principles for the exercise of jurisdiction in criminal cases, which this Court brings before itself by a grant of special leave.\" The minority judgment in the same case 'by Wanchoo, J., (as he then was), so far as the question of interference by this Court was con- cerned, also took more or less the •same view and observed as follows : \"Ordinarily, this Court does not go into the evidence c D E F when dealing with appeals under Art. 136 of the G Constitution particularly when there are concurrent find- ings. This does not mean that this Court will in no case interfere with a concurrent findings of fact in a criminal appeal; it only means that this Court will not so interfere in the absence of special circumstances. One such circum- stance is where there is an error of law vitiating the finding as, for example, where the convliction is based on the testi- H mony of an accomplice without first considering the question (I) A.I.R.~1966 S.C. 1273. A B c D E F G H 288 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1977} 1 S.C.R. whether the accomplice is a reliable witness. Anoth;:)r circumstance is where the conclusion reached by the Courts below is so patently opposed to well established principles of judicial approach, that it can be characterised as wholly unjustified or perverse.\" The only difference between the two views was that while the majority view was that except for the principles mentioned above the Supreme Court could never interfere with the concurrent findings of fact in a criminal appeal, the minority view agreed with the princi- ples but it held that in view of special circumstances as pointed out in the observations quoted above the Court could interfere. At any rate, according to both the views the ratio is that this Court would not normally interfere with the concurrent findings of fact, unless there are special circumstances justifying interference. In Piara Singh v. State of Punjab( 1 ) ·this Court refused to interfere because it thought that the points involved related to pure appreciation of evidence and no error of law was at all committed and observed as follows 'The High Court has examined in detail the argument of the appellant on this point and reached the conclusion that the statement of the approver with regard to the packing of the hand grenade should be accepted as true. The question involved is one of appreciation of evidence and not a question of law.\" In Hargun Sunder Das Godeja and others v. The State of Mahara- shtra C2) it was reiterated that this Court does not normally proceed to review the evidence, unless there was some illegality or irregularity in the approach of procedure. In this connection, the Court observed as follows : \"We may appropriately repeat what has often been pointed out by this Court that under Article 136 of the Constitution this Court does not normally proceed to review the evidence in criminal cases unless the trial is vitiated by some illegality or material irregularity of procedure or the trial fs held in violation of rules of natural justice resulting in grave miscarriage of justice. This Article· reserves to this Court a special discretionary power to interfere in suitable cases when for special reasons it considers that inter- ference is called for in the larger interests of justice.\" In a recent decision of this Ceurt in Guli Chand v. State of Rajas- than (3) this Court observed as follows (I) [1969] I S.C.C. 379. (2) [1970] I S.C.C. 724. k \\ DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fazal Ali, J.) \"It is difficult, after considering the totality _of evidence, to hold that the concurrent findings of fact given by the Courts below as regards the proof of guilt of each accused beyond reasonable doubt are really erroneous one may not agree with the assessment of the evidence of e~ch witness individually either by the trial Court or by High Court. Yet, we do not think that this is a fit case for inter- ference under Article 136 of the Constitution. Conse- quently, we uphold the convictions and sentences of the appellants and dismiss this appeal.\" 28~ To the same effect is the decision of this Court in Kaur Sain v. State of Punjab, (1) where Chandrachud, J., speaking for the Court observed thus : \"It is not the practice of this Court to undertake a fresh appraisal of the evidence in such matters. . . . . . If two views of the evidence were reasonably possible, we would not have substituted our conclusion for that of the High Court.\" The case really lays down that where the appreciation of the evi- dence by the Courts below is nof erroneous even though trhis Court may be inclined to take a different view it would not be a fit case for interference. Another important principle that has been enunciated by this Court is that even where the prosecution case consists of an admix- ture of truth and falsehood it is the duty of the Court to sift truth from falsehood, to separate the grain from the chaff instead of taking the easy course of rejecting the entire prosecution case in view of some discrepancy here or there. If, after applying these legal princi- ples, the Court finds that truth and falsehood are so inextricably mixed together that it is not possible to sift truth from falsehood the Court would be justified in rejecting the prosecution case. In Abdul Gani v. State of Madhya Pradesh( 2 ) this Court observed as follows : \"The learned Sessions Judge was undoubtedly in error · when he said that it was impossible to find out from the state of the prosecution evidence with any amount of cer- tainty who among the accused persons participated in the offence and that it would be a pure gamble to convict any of the accused. He made no effort to disengage the truth from the falsehood and to sift the grain from the chaff but took an easy course and after holding the evidence discre- pant held that the whole case was untrue.\" • To the same effect is a later decision of this Court in Kanbi Nanji Virji dnd others v. State of Gujarat( 3 ) where this Court reiterated as follows : c D• E G \"It is true that often times the courts have to separate· Hi to the truth from falsehood. But where the· two are so (1) [19741 3 S.C.C. 649. 12) A.IR. 1954 S.C.31 0) [19701 3 s.c.c. 103. '2'90 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1977] 1 S.C.R. .A intermingled as to make it impossible to separate them, the evidence has to be rejected in its entirety.\" B ·c 'D E G H Recently also in Dharam Das and others v. State of U.P.(') this Court commented on this aspect of the matter thus : \"In our view, the trial court approached the case ignoring the basic principle that unless the exaggeration and falsehood in the evidence are on points destructive of the substance of the prosecution story, it is the Court's duty to sift . the \\ evidence, separating truth from falsehood, and come to its .. conclusion abont the guilt or innocence of the persons accused of the offence. Exaggeration or falsehood on points which do not touch the core of the prosecution story are not to be given undue importance, provided, of course, there is trustworthy evidence supporting the real substance and core of the prosecution case.\" Thus the principles governiµg interference by this Court m a criminal appeal by special leave may be summarised as follows ( 1) that this Court would not i11terfcre with the concurrent finding of fact based on pure appreciation of evidence even if it were to take a different view on the evidence; (2) that the Court will not normally enter into a reappraise- ment or review of the evidence, unless the assessment of the High Court is vitiated by an error of law or procedure or is based on error of record, misreading of evidence or is inconsistent with the evidence, for instance, where the ocular evidence is totally inconsistent with the medical evidence and so on; ( 3) that the Court would not enter .into credibility of the evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion for that of the High Court; ( 4) that the Court would interfere where the High Court has arrived at a finding of fact in disregard of a judicial pro- cess, principles of natural justice or a fair hearing or has actedf in violation of a mandatory provision of law or procedure resulting in serious prejudice or injustice to the accused; (5) this Court might also interfere where on the proved facts wrong inferences of law have been drawn or where the conclusions of the High Court are manifestly perverse and based on no evidence : -~--- (l) [1972] 2 s.c.c. 216. f / I DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fazal Ali, J.) 2-91 It is very difficult to Jay down a rule of universal al?plication but .t~e principles mentioned above an~ those ~dumbr~te~ in: the a:~thontres of this Court cited supra provide _sufficient gmdelines: for this . C?urt to decide criminal appeals by special leave. . Thus . 111 a cr:mmal appeal by special leave, thi~ Court at tl~e heann_g ~xammes tlie evidence and the judgment of the High Cour~ with the hffilted purpose o~ d~ter­ mining whether or not· the High Court has followed the pnnciples enunciated above. Where the Court finds that the High Court has committed no violation of the various principles laid down by this Court and has made a correct approach and has not ignored or over\" looked striking features in the evidence which demolish ·tlie prosecution case, the findings of fact arrived at by the High Court on an apprecia- tion of the evidence in the circumstances of the case 'would not be disturbed. Much time, energy and expense could be s.aved if the principles enunciated above are strictly adhered to by counsd for the: parties and they confine their arguments within the four corners of tliose principles and they cooperate in this sound and subtle judicial method without transgressing the limits imposed by the decisions of this Court on its power to interfere with the concurrent findings of fact. In the instant case both the Courts below have, after full and complete. appreciation of the evidence,. accepted the prosecution case and have held tliat the guilt against all the appellants has been proved beyond reas9.nable doubt. This should have been sufficient to dispose of this appeal. But as Mr. Frank Anthony learned counsel for the appellants has arg11ed the case at very great length and seemed to have prepared the case with great thoroughness and from corner to corner, we :would like to deal with some of the important arguments advanced by him after giving a brief narration of the main features .of the prosecution case. . This is really a most unfortunate case of patricide where a son along with his companions appears to have murdered his own father and brother over a petty partition. dispute relating to few Killas, of land. The murder committed by the appellants, if. proved, is both gruesome, brutal and unprovoked. The decea,sed Ajaib Singh appears t<;> have parti~ioped his properties between his two sons, namely, Dalbir Smgh-who 1s one of the appellants-and Amir Singh one of the sons who was killed. Ajaib Singh owned 18 killas of land which wa5 divi?ed. in three shares, two shares being allotted to Dalbir Singh and Amir Singh and one share was kept by the deceased Ajaib. Sipgh for himself. After tlie partition Dalbir Singh separated .and lived in a separate portion of the house, while both the deceased Ajaib Singh and Amir Singh lived jointly in two rooms the verandah being com- mon. Ajaib Singh was having joint mess and cultivation with his son Amir Singh. Dalbir Singh :was married to Mst. \"Dalbir Kaur @ Bhiw who is also one of the appellants. Amir Singh was married to ·Mst. Jaswant Kaur. As Jaswant Kaur had given birth to. a child she had called her mother Mst. Shiv Kaur to look after her and the child. According to the prosecution Dalbir Singh left for his father- A .E A c D E F G H 292 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [19\"/7] 1 S.C.R. in-law's village Santupura a day prior to the occurrence, while his wife Bhiro along with her children followed him in the morning of the day of occurrence. It is alleged that on the might intervening 30th and 31st July, 1973 at about 1 A.M. Jaswant Kaur and her hus- band Amir Singh were lying on their cots in the verandah and Shiv Kaur was also sleeping in front of the verandah while Ajaib Singh was lying on a cot near the buffalo in the court-yard. As the newly born child of Jaswant Kaur was not well both Jaswant Kaur and her mother Shiv Kaur were awake to nurse him. At ihat time electric bulb was burning in the court-yard because an electric connection had been recently taken from a neighbour in view of the illness of the child of Jaswant Kaur. Near about 1 A. M. Jaswant Kaur and Shiv Kaur heard the noise of foot-steps and they saw Dalbir Singh, Ajit Singh and Puran Singh armed with kirpans while Dalbir Kaur @ Ilhiro armed with a datar standing by the side of the cot of Ajaib Singh. Dalbir Singh had an altercation with his father Ajaib Singh and expressed his dis-satisfaction over the partition of the lands and a>ked his father and brother to get ready to meet the consequence:; and to call anybody for help if they liked. Thereupon Dalbir Singh gave a kirpan blow on the left jaw of Ajaib Singh and Bhiro gave a datar blow on his right shoulder, while Ajit Singh and Puran Singh gave kirpan blows on his chest. After this gruesome operation was over, the accused proceeded to the cot of Amir Singh who was caught hold of by Dalbir Singh and Puran Singh and Ajit Singh is alleged to have given a kirpan blow on. his right leg while Mst. Bhiro gave a datar blow on his left shoulder. Dalbir Singh and Puran Singh then dragged Amir Singh and put him over the body of Ajaib Singh and thereafter all the appellants caused further injuries to Amir Singh and Ajaib Singh with their respective weapons on different parts of their bodies as a result of which they succumbed to the injuries. Jaswant Kaur and Shiv Kaur raised alarm but they were threatened to keep quiet as a result of which these two helpless ladies shut them- selves up in one of the rooms. Sometime in the early morning the accused who had :stayed on in their part of the house left the village and went away. Jaswant Kaur narrated the incident to Mukhtar Singh and Mohinder Singh and ultimately left with Mohinder Singh and lodged the First Information Report at police station Sadar Batala at 9 A.M. Thereafter the Investigating Officer proceeded to the spot, prepared an inquest report sent bodies of the two deceased for post-mortem examination and conducted the usual investigations. It is further alleged that in the course of the investigation all the appe- llants made certain statements on the basis of which recoveries of the kirpans and the datar were made from the accused concerned. The police after usual investigation submitted chargesheets as a result of which the appellants were committed to the Court of Session and ulti- mately convicted and sentenced as indicated above. The Sessions Judge made a reference to the High Court for confirmation of the sentence imposed on all the appellants and appeals were also filed by all the accused and the High Court after considering the entire evidence agreed with the view taken by the Sessions Judge confirmed the sentences and dismissed the appeals. DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fe.cal Ali, J.) 293 The defence pleaded innocence and Ajit Singh particularly pleaded 11/ibi and stated that he had never gone w the viilage Marrar Kalan where the occurrence had taken place. It might be mentioned here that the appellant Puran Singh was a full brother of Bhiro while Ajit .Singh was her cousin. The central evidence against the appellan~s .consists of the statements of P.W. 3 Jaswant Kaur and P. W. 4 Shiv Kaur who have given a complete narrative of the prosecution case as indicated above. These two eye witnesses have been described as interested witnesses by counsel for the appellants but we do not subs- .cribe to this view. There can be no doubt that having regard to the fact that the incident took place at mid-night inside the house of Ajaib . Singh, the only natural witnesses who could be present to see the A B. ast>ault. would be Jaswant Kaur and her mother Shiv Kaur. No out- sider can be expected to have come at that time because the attack by the· appellants was sudden. Moreover a close relativie who is a very · C 1rntu.ral witness cannot be regarded as an interested witness. The term \"interested\" postulates that the person concerned must have some ·direct interest in seeing that the accused person is somehow or the other convicted either because he had some animus with the accused ·or for some other reason. Such is not the case here. In the in- stant case there is absolutely no evidence to indicate that either Jas- want Kaur or Shiv Kaur bore any animus against the accused. This Court had an occasion to decide as to whether a relative could be treated as an interested witness. In Dalip Singh and others v. State .of Punjab(') this Court expressed i't:'i surprise over the impression which prevailed in the minds of the members of the bar that relatives were not independent witnesses and in order to dispel the same the ·qualities of independent witnesses were clearly elucidated. In this ·connection, Vivian Bose, J., speaking for the Court observed as follows : \"We are unable to agree with the learned Judges of the ?igh Court th3:t the testimony of the two eye-witnesses . reqmres corroboration. If the foundation for such an observation is based on the fact that the witnesses are wo~en and that the fate of seven men hangs on their testimony, we know of no such rule. If it is e:rounded on the reason that they are closely related to the deceased we ar~ !1nable to concur. This is a fallacy common to many cnmmal cases and one which another Bench of this Court endeavoured to dispel in Rameshwar v. The State of Rajasthan [19521 S.C.R. 377 & 390. We find how- ·ever, that it unfortunately still persists, if not in the judg- ments of the courts, at any rate in the arguments of counsel. A witness is no~mally to be considered independent unless he or she springs from sources which are likely to { 1) [1954] S.C.R. W D E G H A B 294 · SUPREME COURT REPORTS' [1977] 1 S.C.R. be tainted and that ·usually means unless the witness has cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish · to implicate him falsely. ·Ordinarily, a close relative would be the last to screen the real culprit ·and falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run high and there is personal cause for enmity, that there is a tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a grudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth.\" A similar view was taken in a later decision of this Court in C Masalti v. State of U.P. (') when.: this Court observed as f!=Jllows : I), E F G H \"But. it would, we think, be unreasonable to contend that evidence given by witnesses should be discarded only on the ground that it is evidence of partisan or interested witnesses .................. The' mechanical rejection of such evidence on the sole ground that it is partisan .. would invariably lead to failure of justice.\" In Guli Chand's case (supra) it was pointed out that normally close relatives of the deceased would not · be considered to be interested witnesses who would falsely mention the names of other persons as responsible for causing injuries to the deceased. Thus in this case also the Court held that the witnesses concerned even though relatives could not be considered to be interested or partisan. This Court observed at p. 702 thus : \"It has been held by this Court that the mere fact that a witness is a relation of a victim is not sufficien~ to discard his testimony.\". To the sme effect are the observations by this Court in Sta.te of Punjab v. Jagir Singh & Ors.(\") For these reasons, therefore, I am unable to reject the evidence of P.Ws. 3 and 4 merely on the ground that they were relatives of the deceased. I have myself carefully gone through the entire evidence of these two witnesses and I find that shorn of a few embel- lishments here and· there their testimony has a ring of truth a colour of consistency and a sense of straightforwardness as a result of which their evidence inspires great confidence. They have given a graphic description of what they had seen. In these circumstances, therefore, I do not sec any reason to discard the assessment of the Courts (I) [1964] 8 S.C.R. 133 (2) [1974] 3 S.C.C. 277 \\ - ' / DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fa.zal Ali, I.) 295 below regarding these two witnesses. I will, however, deal with the general comments made by counsel for the appellants regarding the entire case a little later. Thus once the evidence of these two wit- m:sses is believed, the prosecution case stands proved, apart from any- thing else. It will, however, appear that the prosecution had led cir- cumstantial evidence to support the intrinsic evidence given by these witnesses. One of the reasons for the presence of P.W. 4 Shiv Kaur in the hollSe and the electric installation was that J,aswant Kaur had recently given birth to a child. This fact is clearly proved from the l3irth Register Ext. P.O., which has been proved by P.W. 10, which clearly shows that a son. was born to Amir Singh who is also known as Bhagta Singh on July 11, 1973. The entry has been made on July 14, 1973. This extract from the Birth Register . has been proved by P.W. 10 Sohan Singh· Chowkidar of the village who maintains birth and death register and testifies on oath that he had himself seen the child of Jaswant Kaur. These two pieces of evidence therefore prove conclusively that the evidence of. the two witnesses was absolutely true in the. sense that one J aswant Kaur had given birth to a child she had called Shiv Kaur a few days before her delivery. The occurrence took: place a little more than two weeks after the birth of the child. Similarly the witnesses (P.Ws. 3 and 4) have categorically stated that at the time when the accused entered the house an electric bulb was burning because the child was not well. That there was electricity fitting in the house and a bulb in. the court-yard is established from the sketch map of the place prepared by P. W. 5 Bal Krishan who has been examined to prove the sketches prepared by him which shows the electric fitting and the bulb. This is further corroborated by the evidence of P.W. 5 Mohinder Singh. phot('-o grapher who had prepared the photograph . Ext. P.N.. which also proves the electric fittings. In these circumstances the testimony of these two witnesses on these two essential points is fully corrobora- ted by the other evidence. Mr. Anthony however submitted that the prosecution has not ·examined the best evidence. namely, Mohinder Sirigh from whom the electric connection was borrowed. This was a very minor matter and the evidence led by the prosecution clearly proved the fact that there was electric in.stallation and the bulb actually b~rning at the time of occurrence and non-examination of Mohinder Singh. would not outweigh the evidence given by the eye witnesses corroborated as it is by the evidence of P. Ws. 5 & 6 and the documents· Exts. P.N. and P.M. The prosecution has further led the evidence of recovery of the weapons from all the appellants at their instance which are Exts. P.O., P.S., P.T., and P.U. The weapons recovered were bfood- stained and they were recovered at the instance of the appellants. Both the Courts below have accepted this evidence and this was 1 sought to be repelled by learned counsel for the appellants on the ground that no independent witness as such as has been examined to prove the recoveries. It would appear that so far as Ext. P. Q. 3-J 104SCI/76 A B c D E F G H A B c D E F G H 296 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1977] 1 s:c.R. the recovery of kirpan from Pooran Singh is concerned it has been proved by Darshan Singh brother of Jaswant Kaur. We find that Jaswant Kaur was not an interested witness because she was the wife of one of the deceased. Her brother Darshan Singh's testimony does not suffer from any infirmity and he must be considered to be an independent witness because he bears no animus whatsoever against any of the appellants. Darshan Singh was examined as a witness as P.W. 11 and was examined at great length but no suggestion was given to him that he had any enmity against the accused. The only thing that was suggested to him was that he was deposing falsely because of his relationship--a ground which cannot be entertained. . As regards the recoveries of the weapons at the instance of Dalbir Kaur, Dalbir Singh and Ajit Singh, it is true that they have been attested by the police officers and some independent persons as search witnesses. The police officers have been examined to prove the search but the other witnesses have not been examined. That by itself does not introduce any serious infirmity in the evidence furnished by the . recoveries which at best is only a corroborative piece of evidence. We shall, however, take up the case of Ext. P.U. the recovery of kiq::an from Ajit Singh a little later. The learned counsel for the appellants relied on a decision of this Court in Nachhettar .Singh & other9 v. State of Punjab(') where Bhagwati, J., speaking for the Court observed as follows : \"It is because of 'the serious infirmities in the main version of the occurrence that the story of arrest, recovery of fire-arms and cartridges from the person of the appel- lants and the .findings of the empt.ies at the place of occur- rences assumed importance. . . . . . The recovery in the cir- cumstances of this case ought to have been proved by exa- mining the witnesses who had witnessed the recovery.\" In the first place that case is clearly distinguishable because the recovieries in that case suffered from various other infirmities 'which led the Court to reject that evidence. Again what the Court observed was that the recovery should be proved by examining witnesses who had witnessed the recovery. In the instant case the witnesses were no doubt examined to prove the recoveries and both the courts below have accepted their evidence. . This is not a case where no witnesses for recoveries were examined at all so that the evidence of recovery could be thrown out on that ground also. In these circum- stances, therefore, the case cited by the learned counsel for the appel- lants does not appear to be of any assistance to him and therefore we overrule the :contention of the learned counsel on this scope. It was further urged that there does not appear to be any motive for murder of the two deceased persons by the appellants who happen- ed to be the son of one of the deceased and brother of another. It (l) A.LR. 1976 S.C. 831. \\ \\ TJALBJI!. KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fazal Ali, J.) 297 was submitted that in case of patricide the prosecution must prove strong and compelling motive before the murder can be accepted. The learned Sessions Judge has :accepted the evidence of motive, namely, the fact that the appellant Dalbir Singh was wholly dissatis- fied with the partition of properties and particularly because his' father Ajaib Singh used to. give the produce of the land to .his brother Amir Singh. The Sessions Judge on the question of motive found a~ follows: \"This was the main bone of contention between Ajaib Singh and Dalbir Singh accused. Dalbir Singh accused wanted to have three more- killas of land from Ajaib Singh but the latter refused to part with his land. Al!hough ~s discussed above, the circumstances of the case do point out that the accused had a motive to commit the crime, yet ev,en if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the prosecution has not been able to prove by good evidence that the accused had any impelling motive to commit the crime, it would not render :any help to them.\" The High Court also confirmed this finding and held that even if the motive was not proved, if the evidence of the eye witnesses Jaswant Kaur and Shiv Kaur is accepted the question of motive pales into insignificanc.e and becomes absolutely acedemic. We would, how- .ever, hasten to add that this is no doubt the .:orrect proposition of law, but in the instant case we should remember that lust of land is a very sensitive matter. We have known a very large number of cases resulting in . serious disputes cultimating in murders over small land disputes. Various persons react· differently in similar circumstances and we cannot, therefore, exclude the possibility of the appellant Dalbir Singh having reacted very sharply against what he considered to be an inequitable distribution of the property .. This would undoubtedly provide an adequate motive for the murder which is demonstrated by the fact that the two deceased persons were actually murdered by Dalbir Singh and his party. In these circumstances we are satisfied that the finding of the Courts below on this point is absolutely correct I shall now deal with two important points which were vehemently pressed by Mr. Anthony learned counsel for the appellants. In th1; first place it was contended that the entire prosecution case should be thrown out because of non-examination of four material witnesses in this case. It was submitted that even according to the evidence of Jaswant Kaur her neighbours Mohinder Singh and Daya Singh had also witnessed the occurrence. Jaswant Kaur stated this fact at p. 46 of Paper Book No. II but she also added that even though they were watching the occurrence they did nothing to help the deceased nor did they raise any alarm. . The counsel further submitted that these two witnesses were interrogated by the police and yet they have not been examined to prove and corroborate the evidence of the eye witnesses. This omission is undoubtedly there and we have to see as to what B F G H A B c D E F G H 29& SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1977] 1 S.C.R. is its effect on the truth of the prosecution case. In· the same token it was also contended that two other witnesses, namely, Mukhtiar Singh and Mohinder Singh who immediately came to the house and to whom the eye witnesses narrated the occurrence have also not been examined. Particular comment was made regarding the non-examina- tion of Mohinder Singh who had in fact accompanied the informant to the police station. It was argued by Mr. Anthony that in view of this deliberate omission to examine material witnesses a reflection is cast on the fairness of the trial so as to vitiate the conviction of the appellants. Strong reliance was placed by counsel for the appellant~ on the decision of this Court in Habeeb Mohammad v. The State of Hyderabad.(') In that case what had happened was that the only witness examined to prove the firing by the accused was a police J amadar whereas a very senior police officer who is said to be present at the time when the accused gave orders for firing was not produced and what was more was that no explanation for the omission to examine this witness was given. In view of these circumstances and the other infirmities appearing in that case generally, this Court held that such an omission to produce a material witness was sufficient to throw doubt on the prosecution case. In this connection this Court observed thus : \"In this situation it seems to us that Biabani who was a top-ranking police officer present at the scene was a material witness in the case and it was the bounden duty of the prose- cution to examine him, particularly when no allegation was made that if produced, he would not speak the truttf ..... In our opinion, not only does an adverse inference arise against the prosecution case from his non-production as a witness in view of illustration (g) to secti0n 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, but the circumstance of his being withheld from the court casts a serious reflection on the fairness of the trial.\" The facts of that case are clearly distinguishable from the facts of the present case. To begin with, in that case, excepting the interested witness the police J amadar there was no other eye witneSIS to support the occurrence. Secondly, this Co~rt clarified its observations that an adverse inference could be drawn only if no explanation for the non-examination was given or if no allegation was made that the witness if produced would not speak the truth. Thirdly, it appears that although an application was made to the Trial Court for exami- nation of the witness concerned under s. 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court did not accede to this prayer. In the instant case the prosecution has given very reasonable explanation for not examining these witnesses and there is nothing to show that the accused filed any application before the Trial Court or even before the High Court for examining these witnesses as the Court witnesses nor did they choose to examine them as the defence witnesses. The Public (1) [1954] S.C.R. 475. DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fazal Ali, J.) 299 Prosecutor in his statement before the Sessions Judge clearly stated thus at p. 57 of Paper Book No. II : \"I give up lnder Singh and Sadhu Singh PWs as the uncles· of Dalbir Singh accused, Mohinder Singh as maternal uncle of Dalbir Singh, I also give up Mukhtar Singh, Nazir Masih, Pursan Masih, Chanan Singh and Ravinder Singh PWs as having been won over by the' accused. They are not likely to speak the truth and they are present in court.\" A B The reasons given by the Public Prosecutor are quite understandable, because the witnesses who had been given up either on the ground that they were relatives of the appellant Dalbir Singh or that they had been won over by the accused and were not likely to speak the truth. This statement of the Public Prosecutor. which was recorded by the C Trial Court on June 3, 1974 clearly takes the case out of the ambit of the ratio of the decision in Habeeb Mohamed's case (supra). Further more, in the inistant case, there were two independent wit- nesses P.Ws. 3 and 4 who had proved the actual occurrence and their ·evidence was fully corroborated by the medical evidence and the evidence of the recovery of the weapons at the instance of the appel- D lants themselves. In these circumstances, therefore, the principles laid down in Habeeb Mohamed's case (supra) will not apply to this case at all. Further more in Habeeb Mohamed's case there was a serious violation of procedure because the Trial Court refused to summon those witnesses who were cited by the defence which was by itself sufficient to vitiate the trial. It was in view of these circum- stances that this Court was not prepared to convict the accused. In E these circumstances, therefore, ·the case relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants has no application to the present case. J.. Reliance was also placed on a decision of this Court in Sahaj Ram v. State of U.P. (') where this Court observed as follows : \"There is a clear finding of 1:he Sessions Court to the ·effect that P.Ws. 1 to 3 had a very strong motive to falsely implicate the four' accused forming group II. In view of these circumstances, the High Court's consideration of the evidence of P.Ws. 1 to 3 is faulty and erroneom. The con- viction of the appellants by the High Court is based exclu- ·sively on the evidence of these witnesses givicg great impor- . tance to Ext. Ka-8. We have already held that Ext. Ka-8 should not have been taken into account. Having due re- -gard to the other circumstances. referred to above, the evidence of P.Ws. 1 to 3 even as regards the appellants, stands considerably discredited and no conviction can be · based on such an evidence. This really is a case, in our opm1on, where the courts have substantially disbelieved the substratum of the prosecution's case and have reconstructed a story of their own against the appellants.\" ·--- (I) A.l.'l. I )73 S.C . 61 8. F G H A B c D E F G 300 SUPREME COURT REPORTS ~1977]. 1- s:c.li. lt would appear that in t.hat case there was no evidence of the eye: witnesses at all who were examined as court witnesses and who des- troyed the prosecution case completely. Further more, the witnesses examined by the prosecution, namely, P.Ws. 1 to 3 were facti0nal witnesses and the finding was that they had very strong motive to· implicate the accused. Lastly in that case the F.I.R. on which the High Court relied was found to be inadmissible in evidence. It was. in these circumstances that an adverse inference was drawn against the prosecution for non-examining some of the witnesses. That case· also therefore has no application to the facts of the present case. On the other hand in Narain and others v. The Staie of Punjab(')· it was pointed out by this Court that if non-examination of material'. witnesses was deliberate and international then a seriom reflection was. cast on the prosecution and the Court observed as follows : \"We agree that if a material witness has been deliberately or unfairly kept back, then a serious reflection is cast on' the propriety of the trial itself and the validity of the conviction resulting from it may be open to challenge.\" In the instant case it has been seen that the Public Prosecutor has· given a statement that the witnesses concerned were either relatives of the accused or that had been gained over by the accused and· were, therefore, not likely to speak the truth. In view of this explana- tion it cannot be said that the witnesses were deliberately withheld or unfairly kept back and therefore no adverse inference could be drawn against the prosecution for non-examination of those witnesses. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in Masalti's case (supra) which Wll~ also relied upon by counsel for the appellants on this point. In that CfiS@ th~ Court obs~:rved as follows : \"it is uncioubteci1y the duty of the prosecution to lay be\" fore the Court all material evidence available to it which is necessary for unfolding its case; but it would be unsound to lay down as a general rule thaft every witness must be examined even though his evidence may not be very material or even if it is known that he has been won over or terrorised. In such a case, it is always open to the defence to examine such witnesses as their witnes:ses ai:,d the court can also call such witnesses in the box in, ihe interest of justice under s. · 540 Cr. P.C.\" From the observations made by this Court it is quite clear that there is no duty on the prosecution to examine witnesses who might have been gained over by the accused and even if those witnesse1s are not produced by the prosecution there is nothing to stop the accused from applying to the Court for examining such witr1esses under s. 540 of the Code of Cdminal Procedure. No such application was ever made by the appellants either before the Trial Court or the High Co_urt but for the first time it was made in this Court and that too durmg the (1) [1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 724. DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fazal Ali, l.) 301 cc,urse of the arguments. T~is Court in its sp<:;;ial jurisdiction does not entertain such applications, particularly because the accused had an opportunity to make a similar application before the Courts below and they have not availed of the same. For these reasons, therefore, Cnminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 1291 of 1976 filed by the appel- lants in this Court is rejected. There is one peculiar feature in this. case which is with regard to the eye witnesses Mohinder Singh and Daya Singh who are alleged to have seen the occurrence. According to P.W. 3 they refused to give statements to the police as deposed to by the Investigating Officer P.W. 14 at p. 65 of Paper Book No. II. In this connection P.W. 14 Sub-Inspector categorically stated as follows : (p. 66 of Paper Book No. II) \"I wanted to . record the statements of Mohinder Singh and Daya Singh under section 161 Criminal Procedure Code on 1st August, 1973 but they were not prepared to make statements regarding this occurrence and to become witnesses.\" What the witness really meant was that although he did interrogate the witnesses who must have given some statement, yet they were not at all prepared to be cited as witness for the purpose of giving evidence. I had sent for the case diary and all that we can say is that after per- using the same I do not think that the statement made by the witness can be said to be either wrong or incorrect. The witness does not bear any animus .against the accused nor was any such suggestion made to him in cross-examination. I, therefore, do not see any reason to distrust the evidence of the Investigating Officer P.W. 14 on this point. If his evidence is accepted, then the prosecution has given an adequate expla,nation for not examining Mohinder Singh and Daya Singh, and therefore no adverse inference can be drawn against the prosecution. It was· then submitted that there was delay in the lodging of the F. I. R. and also in its despatch to the Magistrate. This argument is to be stated only to be rejected. The eye witnesses have clearly stated that after the gruesome occurrence they were threatened by the accused as a result of which they had to shut themselves in the room and it was only in the morning when the accused had left the. house A B c D E F that Jaswant Kaur accompanied by Mohinder Singh started for the G police station at 6 A.M. and lodged the F.l.R. at the police station at 9 A.M. the police station being at a distance of six miles from village Marrar Kalan where the occurrence took place. In view of these facts it is not reasonable to except the informant to have reached the police station earlier than 9 A.M. It was impossible to expect from the informant who was a woman to rush to the police station at night and take the risk of being killed by the accused who had H -r stayed on in their part of the house even after the occurrence and had left the house only in the morning. It was. however, su?gested that there was delay in the despatch of the F.I.R. to the Magistrate, A B c D E F G H 302 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1977] 1 S.C.ft.. This matter has been clearly explained by the Sub-Inspector who after making the necessary entries arrived at the spot and sent Constable Prem Chand P.W. 15 to take the F.l.R. to the Magistrate. P. W. 15 Prem Chand has deposed that he had gone to the Magistrate's Court but as the Magistrate was not in his seat he proceeded to Gurdaspur to give a copy of the F.I.R. to Superindendent of Police and after his return he delivered the F.I.R. to the Magistrate at 3 P.M. Both the Courts below have believed the evidence of P.W. 15 which is suppor- ted by the documents and the fact that the Magistrate actually received the F.I.R. at 3 P.M. If the accused wanted to contest this fact they should have examined the officers of the Court of the Magistrate to find out whether or not the Magistrate was available in his seat in the morning as deposed to by Prem Chand. At any rate, this is a pure findirig of fact which is arrived at on the basis of the evidence led by the prosecution and we are not prepared to re-open this finding in the present appeal by special leave in view of the decisions of this Court. It was also argued that the evidence of P.Ws. 3 and 4 should be disbelieved because they have given graphic description of the occur- rence by detailing the nature of the in juries and the parts of the body where they were inflicted. Such a photogenic description smacks of the evidence being a tainted one according to the counsel for the appellants. Reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra(') where this Court observed thus : \"Some attempt was made to show that the many injuries found on the person of the deceased and the manner of their infliction as deposed to by the eye-witnesses do not tally. There is no doubt that substantially the wounds and the weapons and the manner of causation run congruous. Photo- graphic picturisation of blows and kicks and hits and strikes in an attack cannot be expected from witnesses who are not fabricated and little turns on indifferent incompatibilities. Efforts to harmonise humdrum details betray police tutoring not rugged truthftllness.\" The observations made by this Court were made having regard to the peculiar facts of that case and cannot be taken to lay down a rule of universal application. In the instant case the witnesses watched the occurrence from a close distance in an electric light. The assault was so dastardly and gruesome that it must have made a definite and last- ing impact on the memory of the witnesses that made them remember the assault with its grotesque details. Human memory is like a cainera which takes snap shots of striking incidents and then transmits the same through word of mouth faithfully with absolute accuracy and precision. Moreover, it is not a question of giving photographic details at ~11. but the witnesses have merely d\"~cribed what thev actual- ly saw. It is manifest that in view of the electric bulb burning, the ~------- ---- - (1) [1973] 2 S.C.C. 793. \\ ... ' ,• A B c D E F G H 304 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1977] 1 s.C.R. stances the possibility of this witness makip.g an honest mistake in identifyi'.1g Ajit Singh cannot be safely excluded or ruled our. It may ~e ment10ned here that the accused Ajit Singh at the time of surrender- mg gave an application which is Ext. D. B. at p. 42 of Paper Book Part II where he categorically prayed that he should be put at the test identification parade for identification by all the eye witnesses who did not know him from before. In his statement under s. 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also Ajit Singh took the stand that he had never gone to the village Marrar Kalan before or after the occurrence and that is why he surrendered not at Batala but at Gurdaspur so that he might not be got identified by the police to the witnesses. The Magistrate passed an order that the accused Ajit Singh should be identified at the test identification parade but unfor- tunately while Shiv Kaur was asked to identify the appellant Ajit Singh at the test identification parade, Jaswant Kaur was not asked to identify him there. It is true that J aswant Kaur has stated in her evidence that she knew the appellant Ajit Singh as being the cousin of Mst. Bhiro the wife of her husband's elder brother. He used to come to the house off and on. It is, therefore, clear that Jaswant Kaur herself might have caught only a glimpse of the appellant Ajit Singh when he came to meet Mst. Bhiro who admittedly lived in a separate portion of the house and, therefore, the witness Jaswant Kaur could not have known the appellant Ajit Singh very well. At any rate, either Ajit Singh was known to the witness Jaswant Kaur or he was not known. In any case, in view of the stand taken by Ajit Singh the prosecution should, in all fairness, have put J aswant Kaur also at the test identification parade to identify Ajit Singh. If Ajit Singh was not known to Jaswant Kaur as he said, then she would not have been able to identify him. If Ajit Singh was known to her, then also the prosecution was not to lose anything. In view of these circumstances, therefore, I feel it unsafe to rely on the single testi- mony of Jaswant Kaur, ~o far as the appellant Ajit Singh is concerned. This, however, does not mean that I am casting any reflection on the credibility or truthfulness of any of the eye-witnesses. The appel- lant Ajit Singh_may have been one of the assailants but in view of the circumstances mentioned above, a reasonable doubt ar_ises, regarding his participation, which must be given to him. If the evidence of Jaswant Kaur is excluded from consideration, so far as Ajit Singh is concerned, then the evidence of the recovery of kirpan from Ajit Singh by itself was not sufficient to connect him with the crime, par- ticularly when there was no statement by Ajit Singh wherein he had confessed assaulting the deceased and then pointed out to the weapon as being the weapon with which he had assaulted the deceased. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the prosecution has not been able to prove its case against Ajit Singh beyond reasonable doubt and the High Court was wrong in convicting him. · So far as the other appellants, namely, Dalbir Kaur, Dalbir Singh, and Puran Singh are concerned, I fully agree with the judgm~nt of the High Court that the case has been proved beyond doubt agamst those appellants and they have been rightly convicted. Both the Court& \\ ' ,.;.. f DALBIR KAUR v. PUNJAB (Fa.zal Ali, J.) 305 below have applied their mind to the question of giving death sentences A- and have pointed out that this being the case of a most dastardly, cruel, gruesome and unprovoked murder of two innocent and helpless persons, while they were asleep, death sentence was the only sentence that could be given to them, particularly to Dalbir Singh and Puran Singh. The Trial Court rightly gave life imprisonment to Dalbir Kaur @ Mst. Bhiro as she was a woman and appears to have played in the hands of her husband. B· The result is that the appeal of Ajit Singh is allowed and the con- viction and sentence imposed on him are hereby set aside. He is acquitted of the charges framed against him and is directed to be set at liberty immediately. The appeal_s of Dalbir Singh, Puran Singh and Dalbir Kaur @ Mst. Bhiro are hereby dismissed and the convictions and sentences imposed on them are affirmed. P.H.P. Appeals partly allowed. c.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
