RENIKUNTLA RAJAMMA 445 (DEAD) BY LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES Versus Appellant; K. SARWANAMMA Respondent. Civil Appeal No. 4195 of2()()8t, decided on July 17, 2014 A. Property Law - Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - Ss. 123, 122 and 129 (after its amendment in 1929) - Gift of immovable property reserving life interest in property for donor, valid - Delivery of possession to donee not essential condition - Rule of Hindu law making transfer of possession a condition for completion of a valid gift stood superseded by S. 123 after the 1929 amendment to S. 129 - Property gifted by retaining possession and right to receive rents of property by donor during donor's lifetime - Held, gift valid - Family and Personal Laws - Hindu Law - Gift B. Property Law - Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - Ss. 122 and 123 - Gift - Retention of life interest by donor, held, valid C. Property Law - Transfer of Property Act, 1882 - S. 126 - Irrevocability of valid gift -Affirmed The appellant, a Hindu woman, executed a registered gift deed in respect of an immovable property in favour of the respondent reserving to herself the right to retain possession and to receive rents of the property during her lifetime. The gift was accepted by the respondent. But subsequently the appellant revoked the gift deed by a revocation deed. The respondent filed a suit assailing the revocation deed and seeking a declaration that the same was invalid and void ab initio. The trial court found that the appellant-defendant had failed to prove that the gift deed set up by the respondent-plaintiff was vitiated by fraud or undue influence or that it was a sham or nominal document. The gift, according to the trial court, had been validly made and accepted by the respondent-plaintiff, hence, was irrevocable in nature. It was also held that since the appellant donor had taken no steps to assail the gift made by her for more than 12 years, the same was voluntary in nature and free from any undue influence, misrepresentation or suspicion. The fact that the appellant donor had reserved the right to enjoy the property during her lifetime did not affect the validity of the deed, opined the trial court. Accordingly, the suit was decreed. The first appellate court and the High Court in second appeal concurred with the findings of the trial court. An apparent conflict between two earlier decisions of the Supreme Court viz. Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker, (1997) 2 SCC 255 and K. Balakrishnan, (2004) 1 SCC 581 had led to reference to the present Bench of the Court for an authoritative pronouncement as to the true and correct interpretation of Sections 122 and 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. t From the Judgment and Order dated 9-3-2006 in Second Appeal No. 809 of 2003 of the High Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

That such acceptance must be given during the lifetime of the donor and while he is still capable of giving is evident from a plain reading of Section 122. A conjoint reading of Sections 122 and 123 makes it abundantly clear that \"transfer of possession\" of the property covered by the registered instrument of the gift duly signed by the donor and attested as required is not a sine qua non for the making of a valid gift. (Para 11) Section 123 of the TP Act is in two parts. The first part deals with gifts of immovable property while the second part deals with gifts of movable property. The difference in the two provisions lies in the fact that insofar as the transfer of movable property by way of gift is concerned the same can be effected by a registered instrument or by delivery. Such transfer in the case of immovable property no doubt requires a registered instrument but the provision does not make delivery of possession of the immovable property gifted as an additional requirement for the gift to be valid and effective. If the intention of the legislature was to make delivery of possession of the property gifted also as a condition precedent for a valid gift, the provision could and indeed would have specifically said so. There is indeed no provision in law that ownership in property cannot be gifted without transfer of possession of such property. Absence of any such requirement can only lead to the conclusion that delivery of possession is not an essential prerequisite for the making of a valid gift in the case of immovable property.

Judicial pronouncements as to the true and correct interpretation of Section 123 of the TP Act have for a fairly long period held that Section 123 of the Act supersedes the rule of Hindu Law which makes the delivery of possession an essential condition for the completion of a valid gift.

Absolute transfer of ownership in the gifted property in favour of the donee was absent in that case which led the Supreme Court to hold that the gift was conditional and had to become operative only after the death of the donee. The judgment is in that view clearly distinguishable and cannot be read to be an authority for the proposition that delivery of possession is an essential requirement for making a valid gift. (Para 19) Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker v. Pranjivandas Maganlal Thakker, (1997) 2 SCC 255, distinguished on facts In the present case, the execution of registered gift deed and its attestation by two witnesses is not in dispute. It has also been concurrently held by all the three courts below that the donee had accepted the gift. The recitals in the gift deed also prove transfer of absolute title in the gifted property from the donor to the donee. What is retained is only the right to use the property during the lifetime of the donor which does not in any way affect the transfer of ownership in favour of the donee by the donor. Therefore, the High Court was justified in refusing to interfere with the decree passed in favour of the donee. (Paras 20 and 21) R. Rajamma v. K.

THAKUR, J.- An apparent conflict between two earlier decisions rendered by this Court, one in Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker v. a Pranjivandas Maganlal Thakker 1 and the other in K. Balakrishnan v. K. Kamalam 2 has led to this reference to a larger Bench3 for an authoritative pronouncement as to the true and correct interpretation of Sections 122 and 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Before we deal with the precise area in which the two decisions take divergent views, we may briefly set out the factual matrix in which the controversy arises. b 2. The respondent-plaintiff in this appeal filed OS No . 979 of 1989 for a declaration to the effect that revocation deed dated 5-3-1986 executed by the appellant-defendant purporting to revoke a gift deed earlier executed by her was null and void. The plaintiff's case as set out in the plaint was that the gift deed executed by the appellant-defendant was valid in the eye of the law and had been accepted by the plaintiff when the defendant donee had reserved to c herself during for life, the right to enjoy the benefits arising from the suit property. The purported revocation of the gift in favour of the respondent- plaintiff in terms of the revocation deed was, on that basis, assailed and a declaration about its being invalid and void ab initio prayed for. 3. The suit was contested by the appellant-defendant herein on several grounds including the ground that the gift deed executed in favour of the d plaintiff was vitiated by fraud, misrepresentation and undue influence. The parties led evidence and went through the trial with the trial court eventually holding that the deed purporting to revoke the gift in favour of the plaintiff was null and void. The trial court found that the defendant had failed to prove that the gift deed set up by the plaintiff was vitiated by fraud or undue influence or that it was a sham or nominal document. The gift, according to e the trial court, had been validly made and accepted by the plaintiff, hence, irrevocable in nature. It was also held that since the donor had taken no steps to assail the gift made by her for more than 12 years, the same was voluntary in nature and free from any undue influence, misrepresentation or suspicion. The fact that the donor had reserved the right to enjoy the property during her lifetime did not affect the validity of the deed, opined the trial court. f 4. In the first appeal preferred against the said judgment and decree, the First Additional District Judge, Warangal affirmed the view taken by the trial court and held that the plaintiff had satisfactorily proved the execution of a valid gift in his favour and that the revocation of a validly made gift deed was legally impermissible. The first appellate court also held that the gift deed was not a sham document, as alleged by the defendant and that its purported g cancellation/revocation was totally ineffective. The defendant's case that she had apprehended grabbing of the property by Sankaraiah forcing her to make a sham gift deed was held not established especially when Sankaraiah had died three years prior to the execution of the revocation deed by the 1 (1997) 2 sec 255 2 (2004) 1 sec 581 3 Renikuntla Rajamma v.

If the gift deed was executed by the donor to save the property from the covetous eyes of Sankaraiah, as alleged by the defendant, there was no reason why the defendant should have waited for three years after the death of Sankaraiah before revoking the same reasoned the court. The first appellate court also affirmed the finding of the trial court that the donee had accepted the gift made in his favour. The appeal filed by the defendant (the appellant herein) was on those findings dismissed. 5. Concurrent findings of facts recorded by the courts below did not deter the appellants from preferring Civil Second Appeal No. 809 of 2003 in which the appellants made an attempt to assail the said findings. The High Court, however, declined to interfere with the judgments and orders impugned before it and dismissed4 the second appeal of the appellant holding that the case set up by the defendant that the gift was vitiated by undue influence or fraud had been thoroughly disproved at the trial. The present appeal is the last ditch attempt by the defendants to assail the findings recorded against them. 6. When the special leave petition came up for preliminary hearing before a Division Bench of this Court, the only question which was urged on behalf of the appellant was whether retention of possession of the gifted property for enjoyment by the donor during her lifetime and the right to receive the rents of the property in any way affected the validity of the gift. That a gift deed was indeed executed by the donor in favour of the donee and that the donee had accepted the gift was not challenged and the finding to that effect has not been assailed even before us. So also the challenge to the gift on the ground of fraud, misrepresentation and undue influence, having been repelled by the courts below, the gift stands proved in all material respects. All that was contended on behalf of the appellant was that since the donor had retained to herself the right to use the property and to receive rents during her lifetime , such a reservation or retention rendered the gift invalid. A conditional gift was not envisaged by the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, argued the learned counsel for the appellant. Inasmuch as the gift deed failed to transfer title, possession and the right to deal with the property in absolute terms in favour of the donee the same was no gift in the eye of the law, contended the learned counsel for the appellant. Reliance in support of that submission was placed by the learned counsel upon the decision of this Court in Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker v. Pranjivandas Maganlal Thakker 1. 7. On behalf of the respondents it was per contra argued that the validity of the gift having been upheld by the courts below, the only question that remains to be examined was whether a gift which reserved a life interest for the donor could be said to be invalid. That question was, according to the learned counsel, squarely answered in favour of the respondents by the decision of this Court in K. Balakrishnan v. K. Kamalam 2. 4 R. Rajamma v. K.

Manmohan Singh 7 in support of the submission that transfer of possession was a a condition under the Hindu law for a valid gift which rule of Hindu law stood superseded by Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. 9. Chapter VII of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with gifts generally and, inter alia, provides for the mode of making gifts. Section 122 of the Act defines \"gift\" as a transfer of certain existing movable or immovable property made voluntarily and without consideration by one b person called the donor to another called the donee and accepted by or on behalf of the donee. In order to constitute a valid gift, acceptance must, according to this provision, be made during the lifetime of the donor and while he is still capable of giving. It stipulates that a gift is void if the donee dies before acceptance. 10. Section 123 regulates the mode of making a gift and, inter alia, C provides that a gift of immovable property must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two witnesses. In the case of movable property, transfer either by a registered instrument signed as aforesaid or by delivery is valid under Section 123. Section 123 may at this stage be gainfully extracted: \"123. Transfer how effected.-For the purpose of making a gift of d immovable property, the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two witnesses. For the purpose of making a gift of movable property, the transfer may be effected either by a registered instrument signed as aforesaid or by delivery. Such delivery may be made in the same way as goods sold may be e delivered.\" 11. Sections 124 to 129 which are the remaining provisions that comprise Chapter VII deal with matters like gift of existing and future property, gift made to several persons of whom one does not accept, suspension and revocation of a gift, and onerous gifts including effect of non-acceptance by the donee of any obligation arising thereunder. These provisions do not f concern us for the present. All that is important for the disposal of the case at hand is a careful reading of Section 123 (supra) which leaves no manner of doubt that a gift of immovable property can be made by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two witnesses. When read with Section 122 of the Act, a gift made by a registered instrument duly signed by or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least g two witnesses is valid, if the same is accepted by or on behalf of the donee. That such acceptance must be given during the lifetime of the donor and while he is still capable of giving is evident from a plain reading of Section 122 of the Act.

Judicial pronouncements as to the true and correct interpretation of Section 123 of the TP Act have for a fairly long period held that Section 123 of the Act supersedes the rule of Hindu law if there was any making delivery of possession an essential condition for the completion of a valid gift. 13. A Full Bench comprising five Hon'ble Judges of the High Court of Allahabad has in Lallu Singh v. Gur Narain8 referred to several such decisions in which the provisions of Section 123 have been interpreted to be overruling the Hindu law requirement of delivery of possession as a condition for making of a valid gift. This is evident from the following passage from the above decision where the High Court repelled in no uncertain terms the contention that Section 123 of the TP Act merely added one more requirement of law, namely, attestation and registration of a gift deed to what was already enjoined by the Hindu law and that Section 123 did not mean that where there was a registered instrument duly signed and attested, other requirements of the Hindu law stood dispensed with: \"7. Dr Katju, on behalf of the appellant, has strongly contended that by Section 123 it was merely intended to add one more requirement of law, namely, that of attestation and registration, to those enjoined by the Hindu law, and that the section did not mean that where there was a registered document duly signed and attested, all the other requirements of the Hindu law were dispensed with. Section 123 has, however, been interpreted by all the High Courts continuously for a very long period in the way first indicated, and there is now a uniform consensus of opinion that the effect of Section 123 is to supersede the rule of Hindu law, if there was any, for making the delivery of possession absolutely essential for the completion of the gift. We may only refer to a few cases for the sake of reference, Dharmadas Das v. Nistarini Dasi9 , Balbhadra v. Bhawani 10, Alabi Kaya v. Mussa Kaya 11 , Madhavraa Mareshvar Pant Amatya v. Kashibai Kam Dattubhai12 , Man Bhari v. Naunidh 13 , Balmakund v. Bhagwan Das14 and Phu[ Chand v. Lakkhu 15 .

Gopinath Jiu Thakur16. We are, therefore, clearly of opinion that a it must now be accepted that the provisions of Section 123 do away with the necessity for the delivery of possession, even if it was required by the strict Hindu law.\" 14. The logic for the above view in Lallu Singh cases flowed from the language of Section 129 of the TP Act which as on the date of the decision rendered by the High Court of Allahabad used the words \"save as provided b by Section 123 of the Act\". Section 129 of the TP Act was, before its amendment in the year 1929, as under: \"129. Saving of donations mortis causa and Muhammadan law.- Nothing in this Chapter relates to gifts of movable property made in contemplation of death, or shall be deemed to affect any rule of Muhammadan law or, save as provided by Section 123, any rule of Hindu or c Buddhist law. \" A plain reading of the above made it manifest that the \"rules of Hindu law\" and \"Buddhist law\" were to remain unaffected by Chapter VII except to the extent such rules were in conflict with Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. This clearly implied that Section 123 had an overriding effect on the rules of Hindu law pertaining to gift including the rule that required d possession of the property gifted to be given to the donee. The decisions of the High Courts referred to in the passage extracted above from Lallu Singh cases have consistently taken the view that Section 123 supersedes the rules of Hindu law which may have required delivery of possession as an essential condition for the completion of a gift. The correctness of that statement of law cannot be questioned. The language employed in Section 129 before its e amendment was clear enough to give Section 123 an overriding effect vis-a.- vis rules of Hindu law. 15. Section 129 was amended by Act 20 of 1929 whereby the words \"or, save as provided by Section 123, any rule of Hindu or Buddhist law\" have been deleted. Section 129 of the TP Act today reads as under: \"129. Saving of donations mortis causa and Muhammadan law.- f Nothing in this Chapter relates to gifts of movable property made m contemplation of death, or shall be deemed to affect any rule of Muhammadan law.\" The above leaves no doubt that the law today protects only the rules of Muhammadan law from the rigours of Chapter VII relating to gifts. This implies that the provisions of Hindu law and Buddhist law saved under g Section 129 ( which saving did not extend to saving such rules from the provisions of Section 123 of the TP Act) prior to its amendment are no longer saved from the overriding effect of Chapter VII.

Decisions of the High Court of Mysore in Revappa v. Madhava Rao6 and the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Tirath v. Manmohan Singh 7 , in our opinion, correctly take the view that Section 123 supersedes the rules of Hindu law insofar as such rules required delivery of possession to the donee. 16. The matter can be viewed from yet another angle. Section 123 of the TP Act is in two parts. The first part deals with gifts of immovable property while the second part deals with gifts of movable property. Insofar as the gifts of immovable property are concerned, Section 123 makes transfer by a registered instrument mandatory. This is evident from the use of word \"transfer must be effected\" used by Parliament insofar as immovable property is concerned. In contradiction to that requirement the second part of Section 123 dealing with gifts of movable property, simply requires that gift of movable property may be effected either by a registered instrument signed as aforesaid or \"by delivery\". The difference in the two provisions lies in the fact that insofar as the transfer of movable property by way of gift is concerned the same can be effected by a registered instrument or by delivery. Such transfer in the case of immovable property no doubt requires a registered instrument but the provision does not make delivery of possession of the immovable property gifted as an additional requirement for the gift to be valid and effective. If the intention of the legislature was to make delivery of possession of the property gifted also as a condition precedent for a valid gift, the provision could and indeed would have specifically said so. Absence of any such requirement can only lead us to the conclusion that delivery of possession is not an essential prerequisite for the making of a valid gift in the case of immovable property. 17. That brings us to the decisions of this Court which have led to this reference. In K. Balakrishnan case 2 the donor executed a gift deed of a specified share of the property inherited by her from her maternal grandfather in favour of her minor son who was the appellant donee before the Court and her four year old daughter. The property gifted included a school building. The gift deed stipulated that the responsibility to sign in regard to the said school and the right to income would be with the donor during her lifetime and thereafter would be vested in the donee. After the execution of the gift deed the donor cancelled the same and made a will bequeathing the property in favour of her daughter whereupon the appellant donee filed a suit for declaration of his title to the suit property on the basis of the gift and a further declaration for annulment of the cancellation deed and the will executed by the donor. The trial court dismissed the suit while the first appellate court decreed the same. The High Court restored the view taken by the trial court and held that when the donor had reserved to herself the right to sign the papers with respect to management of the school and the right to take usufruct from the property where the school was situated, no property was transferred under the deed.

Balakrishnan case2 , SCC p. 586, paras 10-11) \"10. We have critically examined the contents of the gift deed. To us, a it appears that the donor had very clearly transferred to the donees ownership and title in respect of her 118th share in properties. It was open to the donor to transfer by gift title and ownership in the property and at the same time reserve its possession and enjoyment to herself during her lifetime. There is no prohibition in law that ownership in a property cannot be gifted without its possession and right of enjoyment. b Under Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act 'property of any kind may be transferred' except those mentioned in clauses (a) to (i). Section 6 in relevant part reads thus: '6. What may be transferred.-Property of any kind may be transferred, except as otherwise provided by this Act or by any other law for the time being in force. (a) * * * (b) A mere right to re-entry for breach of a condition subsequent cannot be transferred to any one except the owner of the property affected thereby. (c) * * * C (d) An interest in property restricted in its enjoyment to the d owner personally cannot be transferred by him. (e) A mere right to sue cannot be transferred.' 11. Clause (d) of Section 6 is not attracted on the terms of the gift deed herein because it was not a property, the enjoyment of which was restricted to the owner personally. She was the absolute owner of the property gifted and it was not restricted in its enjoyment to herself. She e had inherited it from her maternal father as a full owner. The High Court was, therefore, apparently wrong in coming to the conclusion that the gift deed was ineffectual merely because the donor had reserved to herself the possession and enjoyment of the property gifted.\" ( emphasis supplied) 18. We are in respectful agreement with the statement of law contained in f the above passage in K. Balakrishnan case2 . There is indeed no provision in law that ownership in property cannot be gifted without transfer of possession of such property. As noticed earlier, Section 123 does not make the delivery of possession of the gifted property essential for validity of a gift. It is true that the attention of this Court does not appear to have been drawn to the earlier decision rendered in Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker 1 g where this Court had on a reading of the recital of the gift deed and the cancellation deed held that the gift was not complete. This Court had in that case found that the donee had not accepted the gift thereby making the gift incomplete. This Court further held that the donor cancelled the gift within a month of the gift and subsequently executed a will in favour of the appellant: 2 K. Balakrishnan v. K.

Ltd.~cccc® ION LINE;:: True Print™ a b C d e f g h RENIKUNTLA RAJAMMA v. K. SARWANAMMA (Thakur, J.) 455 on a proper construction of the deed and the deed cancelling the same this Court held that the gift in favour of the donee was conditional and that there was no acceptance of the same by the donee. The gift deed conferred a limited right upon the donee and was to become operative after the death of the donee. This is evident from the following passage from the said judgment: (Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker ease 1, SCC p. 258, para 7) \"7. It would thus be clear that the execution of a registered gift deed, acceptance of the gift and delivery of the property, together make the gift complete. Thereafter, the donor is divested of his title and the donee becomes the absolute owner of the property. The question is whether the gift in question had become complete under Section 123 of the TP Act? It is seen from the recitals of the gift deed that Motilal Gopalji gifted the property to the respondent. In other words, it was a conditional gift. There is no recital of acceptance nor is there any evidence in proof of acceptance. Similarly, he had specifically stated that the property would remain in his possession till he was alive. Thereafter, the gifted property would become his property and he was entitled to collect mesne profits in respect of the existing rooms throughout his life. The gift deed conferred only limited right upon the respondent donee. The gift was to become operative after the death of the donor and he was to be entitled to have the right to transfer the property absolutely by way of gift or he would be entitled to collect the mesne profits. It would thus be seen that the donor had executed a conditional gift deed and retained the possession and enjoyment of the property during his lifetime.\" 19. The above decision in Maganlal Thakker ease 1 clearly rests on the facts of that case. If the gift was conditional and there was no acceptance of the donee it could not operate as a gift. Absolute transfer of ownership in the gifted property in favour of the donee was absent in that case which led this Court to hold that the gift was conditional and had to become operative only after the death of the donee. The judgment is in that view clearly distinguishable and cannot be read to be an authority for the proposition that delivery of possession is an essential requirement for making a valid gift. 20. In the case at hand as already noticed by us, the execution of registered gift deed and its attestation by two witnesses is not in dispute. It has also been concurrently held by all the three courts below that the donee had accepted the gift. The recitals in the gift deed also prove transfer of absolute title in the gifted property from the donor to the donee. What is retained is only the right to use the property during the lifetime of the donor which does not in any way affect the transfer of ownership in favour of the donee by the donor. 21. The High Court was in that view perfectly justified in refusing to interfere with the decree passed in favour of the donee. This appeal accordingly fails and is hereby dismissed but in the circumstances without any order as to costs . 1 Naramadaben Maganlal Thakker v.
