This appeal is filed by Appellants 1 and 2 in Criminal Appeal No. 1068 of2014 filed before the High a Court of Chhattisgarh, Bilaspur, aggrieved by the common judgment in State of Chhattisgarh v. Ishwari Lal Yadav 1• The appellants herein were charged for offences punishable under Sections 364/34 read with Section 120-B IPC, Sections 302/34 read with Section 120-B IPC and Section 201 IPC. On the aforesaid charges they were tried in Sessions Trial No. 98 of 2011 by the learned Sessions Judge, Durg, and they were convicted for the offences charged b and sentenced for imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs 5000 was imposed for the offence under Sections 364/34 read with Section 120-B IPC, sentence of death and a fine of Rs 5000 for the offence under Sections 302/34 read with Section 120-B IPC, rigorous imprisonment for five years and a fine of Rs 2000 for the offence under Section 201 IPC. In view of the death sentence imposed, the learned Sessions Judge made a reference to the High Court in State of Chhattisgarh v. Ishwari Lal Yadav 1. Challenging the conviction recorded and the sentence imposed on them, the appellants have filed Criminal Appeal No. 1068 of 2014. Vide the impugnedjudgment dated 30-11-20161, the High Court has confirmed the conviction recorded against the appellants. However, the death sentence imposed by the trial court is modified to imprisonment for life. It was further observed that the appellant-accused are not entitled to any remission or parole. Aggrieved by the said judgment this appeal is filed. 2. On 4-3-2010, Beem Dewar (PW 2) had lodged a complaint with Police Station Bhilai Nagar, stating that his six-year-old daughter Km Manisha is missing. 3. On 23-11-2010, a child by name Chirag Rajput was found missing from his house. A missing report was given in Police Station Bhilai Nagar, District Durg. Thereafter, the parents were searching for their child. On hearing loud music being played in the house of the appellants i.e. Ishwari Lal Yadav (A-1) and Smt Kiran Yadav (A-2), they entered their house. When they entered the house they found freshly dug mound of earth and the appellants herein who were claiming as \"tantrics\", had admitted that they had killed Chirag and buried him there to attain \"siddhi\". Further, it is the case of the prosecution that during the investigation in the said case, Mahanand Yadav (A-4), made a statement to the police that about seven/eight months earlier, he had kidnapped one small girl on the asking of A-1 and A-2. 4. The said girl had been killed by way of human sacrifice and her body was buried in the compound of the appellants herein. On 24-11-2010, one constable of Bhilai Nagar Police Station made \"O\" entry to the effect, that an information has been received about the kidnapped girl who had been killed by way of human sacrifice and her skeletal remains were recovered along with the clothes which she was wearing. On the said date a statement was recorded under Ext. P-15. On the basis of the aforesaid statement, investigation was done and skeletal remains of the child were recovered.

It is contended by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and in spite of the same they were convicted and sentenced for the offences alleged. It is submitted that the confessional statements ought not to have been relied on in absence of any corroborative evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. It is further contended that there are material contradictions among the witnesses, as such the evidence is unreliable. It is further submitted that the femur bone that was preserved, was sent to CDFC, Hyderabad for DNA analysis, and in fact the report relied upon by the prosecution was the FSL report, Sagar. Even the FSL report does not conclusively draw to the fact that PW 3 is the mother, but, states that she is a biological relative. There are also discrepancies with regard to the clothes found on her. Further, it is submitted that the appellants were in custody from 23-11-2010 and recoveries were made on 24-11-2010 but disclosure statements were recorded thereafter. 10. As such, it is submitted that, same raises a strong probability that these weapons have been planted by the police. It is further submitted that even the blood which was found on the weapons, there is no proof that it was human blood. In support of his arguments, the learned counsel has relied on the judgments of this Court in Aghnoo Nagesia v. State of Bihar2 , Sahadevan v. State of T.N. 3 , Shambu Nath M ehra v. State of Ajmer4 , Ronny v. State of Maharashtra 5 , State ofGoa v. Sanjay Thakran 6 , Prakash v. State of Karnataka7 and Firozuddin Basheeruddin v. State of Kerala 8. 11. To buttress the submission that as there is strong probability that the weapons seized have been planted by the police, as such recoveries cannot be relied on, the learned counsel relied on the judgment in Sanjay Thakran 6 . Further, reliance is also placed on the judgment in Prakash 7. In support of his submission that as the blood on the weapon used in crime is not shown to be that of the deceased, it raises a grave suspicion that investigation was not fair and benefit of doubt is to be given to the accused. 12. On the other hand, Shri Sumeer Sodhi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent State has submitted that as the case relates to the gruesome murder of a minor girl of six years, for the purpose of human sacrifice and from the oral evidence on record, the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, as such there are no grounds to interfere with the impugned judgment1. It is submitted that when a child of two years by name Chirag was missing, his parents were on search for the missing child along with family members and residents of locality; on hearing the loud music emanating from the house of the appellants, they got suspicious and entered the house.

STATE OF CHHATTISGARH (Subha sh Reddy, J.) 443 is submitted that at that point of time both the appellant-accused had confessed their guilt of committing the act of murder of Chirag and burying the body in the precinct of the house. It is submitted that looking at the fresh mound of mud, same was excavated and the body of Chirag was found in two parts. At that time one of the accused in the said case also revealed committing of similar offence of a girl child. It is submitted that there was already a complaint of missing child of six-year-old daughter of Beeru Dewar (PW 2), lodged on 4-3-2010; investigation was made. Further investigation of the police revealed that they had kidnapped and committed murder of minor girl by name Km Manisha. She was also buried near to the place ofChirag. As such by excavating skeletal remains along with clothes were taken out. It is submitted that from the evidence on record it is clearly proved by confession of several independent witnesses , which is corroborated by other evidence on record to prove that Manisha was murdered for the purpose of human sacrifice by the appellants, as such they were rightly convicted and sentenced by the trial court and their sentence of death was modified by the High Court to that of imprisonment for life without any remission or parole. As such, it is submitted that there are no grounds to interfere with the same. The learned counsel has also relied on the judgment in Sushi! Murmu v. State of Jharkhand9 . 13. Having heard the learned counsel on both the sides, we have perused the impugned judgment 1 and also the other material on record. 14. To prove the guilt of the appellant-accused, several independent witnesses were examined. From the evidence on record it is clear that on 23-11-2010 when there was search by the parents of the deceased Chirag Rajput for their missing child along with others of the locality, on hearing the loud music from the house of the appellants, they got suspicious and entered the house. Upon entering the house, a freshly dug mound of earth was found in the house of the appellants and on confession made by the appellants, body of Chirag was traced. Further, as it was disclosed by one of the accused that about 7 /8 months earlier, they have kidnapped one small girl on the asking of A-1 and A-2 and they have handed over the girl to Ishwari Lal Yadav and Kiran Yadav, further investigation was made in view of the complaint lodged by Beeru Dewar (PW 2) on 4-3-2010. On 4-3-2010, Beeru Dewar (PW 2) filed a report to the effect that his six-year-old daughter Km Manisha was missing. On further investigation, the skeletal remains were also recovered from the house of the appellants from the place adjoining from where body of Chirag was taken out. In oral evidence, Beeru Dewar (PW 2), father of the deceased stated that when they went to the house of Ishwari Lal Yadav (A-1), they found the skeletal remains and they have also identified the clothes of his daughter Km Manisha. 15. The mother of the deceased Smt Durga Bai was examined as PW 3. In her deposition, she has stated that about 1 ½ years earlier to the date of statement, she had gone to Kasaridih at about 6.00 p.m. for begging.

From the evidence on record, it is clearly established beyond reasonable doubt that Km Manisha is the daughter of PW 2 and PW 3 and was missing since 4-3-2010. Though, the said complaint was recorded in Police Outpost Padmanabhpur, Durg, on 4-3-2010 but there was no breakthrough. Only after Chirag' s case has come to light, based on admissions by the appellants and two others, further investigation revealed that the appellants earlier also committed similar offence of murder of Km Manisha for their tantric activities and buried the body of the minor girl in their house. 21. The confessional statements made to the police by the appellants, cannot be the basis to prove the guilt of the accused but at the same time there is no reason to discard the confessions made to the independent witnesses at the time when Chirag's body was found, prior to the arrival of police. It is true that extra-judicial confession, is a weak piece of evidence but at the same time if the same is corroborated by other evidence on record, such confession can be taken into consideration to prove the guilt of the accused. In the case on hand, the evidence from independent witnesses is in one voice and consistent. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In addition to the same, PW 2 and PW 3, who are the parents of the deceased have identified the clothes, which the deceased child was wearing on the date of missing. It is also clear from the evidence that the skeletal remains were removed. They have also found the cloth pieces, attached to skeletal remains. The colour of such cloth pieces was tallied with the description in the missing report lodged by PW 2 earlier on 4-3-2010. As such it is clearly proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the appellants are responsible for the offence alleged against them. 22. The learned counsel for the appellants has relied on a judgment of this Court in Aghnoo Nagesia 2 to buttress his contention that the courts below have committed error in recording a finding of guilt of the appellants based on confession. But same is a case where the appellant therein was charged under Section 302 IPC for murdering his aunt and others and there were no eyewitnesses to the murder. The principal evidence against the appellant was first information report which contains a full confession of guilt by the appellant himself. The said confession was made to a police officer and the same is not provable having regard to Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act. 23. Further reliance is also placed on a judgment of this Court in Sahadevan 3 • In the aforesaid judgment of the two-Judge Bench of this Court it is held that the extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence and court must ensure that same inspires confidence and is corroborated by other prosecution evidence. If the totality of oral evidence on record is considered in the case on hand, it is consistent and inspires confidence of the case of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the main accused. We are of the view that the aforesaid judgments would not render any assistance to support the case of the appellants. 24. The learned counsel also relied on the judgment of this Court in Shambu Nath Mehra 4 . In the aforesaid judgment, this Court has held that in a criminal case burden of proof is on the prosecution and Section 106 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that duty. It is held that on the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to establish facts which are \"especially\" within the knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience. In the case on hand it is proved by cogent evidence that the body of Chirag was found in the house of Ishwari Lal Yadav. By applying the provision under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, definitely it is the burden of the accused to explain the fact within the knowledge of them how the body of Chirag came to be buried in their house. The judgment relied on in Shambu Nath Mehra 4 also would not be helpful for the appellants. In Firozuddin Basheeruddin 8 this Court has discussed the ingredients which 2 Aghnoo Nagesia v.

As we are of the view that the evidence on record is not sufficient to prove the guilt of the appellants under Section 120-B IPC, as such it is not necessary to elaborate any further. 25. The other judgments relied on by the learned counsel for the appellants in San jay Thakran 6 and the judgment in Prakash 7 also would not render any assistance to the case of the appellants having regard to facts and circumstances of the present case. Apart from the recoveries there is a strong and consistent evidence of independent witnesses to prove the guilt of the accused. The FSL report, Sagar, conclusively establishes that PW 3 is the biological relative of the deceased. The said evidence, if considered along with other oral evidence of PW 2 and PW 3, it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the skeletal remains of the body removed from the house of the appellants was only that of their daughter Km Manisha. It is also proved from the evidence on record that the house belonged to the appellants where skeletal remains were removed. 26. Further, as there is no acceptable evidence on record except the alleged confession to prove the offence under Sections 364/34 read with Section 120-B IPC, the appellants are entitled for acquittal for offences punishable under Sections 364/34 and Section 120-B IPC. At the same time, by burying the dead body of the deceased, they caused disappearance of evidence of offence; they are rightly convicted for offence under Section 201 IPC. 27. Having regard to the gruesome nature of murder, the trial court has imposed the punishment of death for offence under Sections 302/34 read with Section 120-B IPC but on appeal the High Court has modified 1 the sentence to that of imprisonment for life without any remission or parole. Considering the gruesome nature of murder, the sentence imposed by the High Court is to be confirmed. 28. For the aforesaid reasons, this criminal appeal is partly allowed, setting aside the conviction recorded and sentence imposed for the offence under Sections 364/34 read with Section 120-B IPC. However, we confirm the conviction recorded and sentence imposed for the offence under Sections 302/34 and Section 201 IPC. 6 State of Goa v.
