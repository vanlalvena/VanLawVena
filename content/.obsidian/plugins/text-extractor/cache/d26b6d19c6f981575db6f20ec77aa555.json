The above clearly shows that the Mrs. Arti Singh had made the Power of Attorney dated 12th August 1975 in favour of her father, i.e., the appellant Shri S.N.P. Punj and in fact, the said general power of attorney has still not been revoked/cancelled. We have also noticed that no objection is said to have been taken to the property in the name of Ms. Rohini Chibbar, the daughter of respondent No. 9 R.P. Punj also being included in the award of the arbitrator, though Rohini Chibbar was in the same portion as Aarti Singh. It is not uncommon that properties are purchased by the parents in the names of their children from out of the earning derived from family business. The parties, it is evident sought to put all such properties in the common hotchpotch for ascertaining the respective shares and dividing the properties and assets. Even otherwise, the appellant Aarti Singh has not been divested of her rights in the said property, inasmuch as, the said property has been allocated to the branch of the family which is headed by her father Sh. S.N.P. Punj. Thus, it is evident that properties in the names of all the members of the family including the parents. of Arti Singh by virtue of General Power of Attorney given byArti Singh were included in the terms of the reference and therefore, we are unable to agree with the plea ofShri Sumeet Bansal and the same cannot be accepted. In any case, ifMrs. Aarti Singh has any grievance, the same may be against the appellantSh.S.N.P. Punj, her father. In this view of the matter, we are satisfied that the preliminary objection of the learned counsel for the respondent deserves to succeed and the objections to the award cannot be entertained. 14. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the order of the learned Single Judge does not call for interference and consequently, the appeals are dismissed. · 2009 (109) DRJ 474 HIGH COURT OF DELHI C.R.P. 589 I 1998 Surinder Kaur ............

Present revision petition has been filed for setting aside orders dated 15th December 1997 and 5th May, 1998, whereby petitioner's application to lead secondary evidence under Section 65 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 . (hereinafter referred to as 'IE Act') was dismissed and petitioner was directed to file original documents. 2. Ms. Nandini Sahni, learned counsel for petitioner contended that Agreement to Sell, Receipts and other documents dated 6th August, 1980 executed by respondent No. 1 irifavour of some third party do not mention a word about the Will dated 25th October, 1972 alleged to have been executed by Late Smt.

Learned couns~l furth~r contended that the s:tid Will has been propounded by respondents only to usurp and grab petitioner's share to the extent of 110 square yards in suit property bearing No. C-53, Hari Nagar, New Delhi. 3. She further contended that alleged Willis surrounded by suspicious circumstances and it was never produced for a long number of years before any court or public authority. 4. Ms. Sahni stated that respondent No_. 3 in his cross-examination had stated that an area of 110 square yards of land was sold by Mr. Mangal Singh, respondent No. 1 herein to Mr. S.S. Sabharwal. Subsequently, petitioner on meeting Mr. Sabharwal had come to know that respondent No. 1 had sold the plot to Mr. Narinder Singh Malhotra, who in turn had sold the plot to many persons.

Ms. Sahni, submitted .that since aforesaid original documents could not be produced in a reasonable time and the person holding the original documents cannot be pin-pointed, original documents should be treated as either destroyed or lost and petitioner should be allowed to lead secondary evidence by virtue of Section 65 IE Act. 6. _Ms. Sahni, also submitted that respondents in their reply to petitioner's application under Order XIII Rule 2 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'CPC') had admitted the existence and authenticity of alleged Agreement to Sell, Receipts, Power of Attorney's and Will dated 6th August, 1980. The alleged admission, as contained in respondents' reply is reproduced hereinbelow:- 117 •.• It is further stated that neither the alleged documents are related to the suit property nor are subject matter of scrutiny in the present suit. Said documents were within the knowledge of the plaintiff and has not been challenged till date. Alleged documents, in any case has attained their finality by afflux of time and the plaintiff cannot, at all, rely upon the alleged documents for any purpose whatsoever. It is stated that the witness of defendant is neither obliged to verify the documents of the property which has nothing to do with the present suit nor the alleged documents have been challenged by the plaintiff till date. (emphasis supplied)\" 7. In this context, Ms. Sahni relied upon the followingjudgments:- (A) Nawab Singh v. Inderjeet Kaur, 1999 (4) SCC 418, wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to allow an opportunity to produce documents by leading secondary evidence on the ground that case was covered under Clause (a) of Section 65 of IE Act.

Ltd.~cc~® !ONLINE;\" True Prinf Surinder Kaurv. Sardar Mangal Singh & Ors. 477 8. Mr. N.S. Negi, learned counsel for respondents raised three preliminary objections. Firstly, he submitted that civil revision petition was not maintainable as trial court had not decided the case but only disposed of an interim application. Secondly, he submitted that revision petition challenging orders dated 15th December, 1997 and 5th May, 1998 was barred by limitation and thirdly, he submitted that two orders cannot be challenged in one revision petition. 9. He further submitted that petitioner was guilty of filing contradictory affidavits on oath. He pointed out that on 25th May, 1997, petitioner had filed an application under Order XIII Rule 2 CPC for placing originals of the aforesaid documents on record. Though the said application was allowed on 8th October, 1997 but petitioner instead of filing original documents, filed an application under Order XI Rule 14 CPC seeking a direction to defendants to file the aforesaid documents. But when defendants denied being in possession of the said documents, petitioner thereafter filed an application under Section 65 IE Act on the groun,d that the said documents had been lost or cannot be traced. 10. He submitted that photocopies of documents placed on record by petitioner were neither certified nor authenticated; He stated that original documents must be with present owner of the property which is adjoining petitioner's property and as such original documents cannot be said to have been lost. He further contended that though present case was pending for the last seventeen years, petitioner had not taken any step to summon their next door neighbour, who must be in possession of the said original documents. 11. Lastly, Mr. Negi, submitted that secondary evidence cannot be allowed to be led in rebuttal and that too after eight years of the suit having been filed. He further pointed out that in the reply filed by respondent to the petitioner's application under Section 65 of the I.E. Act it had been · specifically averred as under:- · \"It is submitted that the sale has· been admitted not the alleged photostat copy which are forged at the face of it. It is denied that the .contents of alleged documents have been admitted by the defendant. No application U/o. 11 Rule 14 has been served or supplied to the defendant and the factum of said application is also denied. It is submitted that the defendants are not in possession of any alleged carbon copy and whatever documents were in power and possession of the defendants. The same are already on record.\" (emphasis supplied) 12. I may mention that trial court has rejected two applications filed by petitioner by way of a detailed order dated 15th December, 1997. The · relevant portion of the impugned order is reproduced hereinbelow:- \"5. Although in the application, Ld. Counsel for plaintiff has men- . tioned that for all practical purposes originals of aforesaid documents shall be taken to have been destroyed or lost, provisions of Section 65 of ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: DRJ, © 2024 Delhi Reported Judgments.

Ltd. ~(!;<D® IONLINEf True Prinf 478 DELJ{l REPORTEIJ JUDGMENTS 2009 (109) DRJ .... · Evidence Act do not permit to draw a presumption of destruction or loss. More so, it is not the case of plaintiff that any of the aforesaid document has been destroyed or lost. In .this respect even there is· nothing on the file to show ioss or clestruction of any of the original documents. It is well settled that where explanation for non-production of document is that it has b~eri fost, before tendering evidence loss of document has to be proved. Thus, plaintiff cannot be allowed to lead secondary evidence on the ground of loss or destruction of original docU:ments. 6. Ld. Counsel for plaintiff has simply argued that since property has changed several hands, original documents cannot be traced or produced in a reasonable ti:qie and as such on this sole ground .plaintiff be permitted to prove the aforesaid documents by secondary evidence. In this respect, it is pertinent to mention here that out of entire property of220 sq. yards, plaintiff is stated to be in possession of 110 sq. yards. The aforesaid documents pertain to other 110 sq. yards of property which Shri Mang al Singh (since deceased) brother-in-law of plaintiff sold to Shri Narinder Singh Malhotra on 6.8.1980, on the basis of a Will in his favour alleged to have been executed by his mother Smt. Gurdai Kaur. This other half i.e. 110 sq. yards of property sold to Shri N arinder Singh Malhotra is not the disputed property. When the plaintiff submits that Shri N arinder Singh Malhotra has further sold the property and property has changed several hands, first this fact had to be proved. No ·· materialhas been placed on record to show as to how many times the property has .been sold and as to who purchased it from Shri Narinder . Singh Malhotra and further who purchased the saine from the vendee. In absence of any such material on record I do not find any merit in the contention that it has not been possible for the plaintiff to know the particulars of the ultimate vendee of the property or that original documents executed by Shri Mangal Singh cannot be traced out within reasonable time. The property measuring 110 Sq. yards is adjoining the property in possession of plaintiff. It cannot be said that she is not aware of particulars of or availability of her neighbourer. Case is pending since 1989. Aforesaid documents are of 6.8.1980. In the meanwhile, plaintiff had sufficient and reasonable time to know about the original documents and.the subsequent vendees of the adjoining property. After summoning Shri N arinder Singh Malhotra, the original Vendee, and Shri Gian Singh Sabharwal, the witness and having come to know that original docu- ments are not with the former, plaintiff has not taken any step to gather information about subsequent vendee(s) and about existence/non-exis- tence of original documents. For the foregoing discussion, I do not find any merit in the contention raised by Ld. Counsel for plaintiff. Consequently, second application, under Section 65 of Indian Evidence Act is also dismissed.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: DRJ, © 2024 Delhi Reported Judgments.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf Surinder Kaur v. Sardar Mangal Singh & Ors. 479 13. As far as three preliminary objections raised by respondents are concerned, I am of the view that though civil revision may not be maintainable but a petition under Article 227 of Constitution oflndia would certainly be available. It is settled law that nomenclature under which a petition is filed is irrelevant. Consequently, I treat petitioner's Civil Revision Petition as being a Civil Miscellaneous (Main) filed under Article 227 of Constitution of India. 14. Since I have already treated present petition as a Civil Miscellaneous (Main), issue oflimitation is irrelevant. Undoubtedly, by way of a single p.etition, a petitioner can challenge only one impugned order but in the present case thetwo orders dated 15th December, 1997 and 5th May, 1998 are inextricably inter linked and consequently, I am of the view that ends of justice would be met if petitioner's present petition is entertained, subject to the condition that petitioner deposits another set of court fees for challenging second impugned order. Let the same be done within a period of six weeks from today. 15. Consequently, all the three preliminary objections raised by respondents stand negated. 16. Before I may proceed with merits of the controversy, I may refer to Sections 65 and 66 of IE Act which are reproduced hereinbelow:- \"65. Cases in which secondary evidence relating to documents may be given. - Secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document in the following cases: (a) . when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power• of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved, or of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the Court, or of any person legally bound to produce it, and when, after the notice mentioned in section 66, such person does not produce it; (b) when the existence, condition or contents of the original have been proved to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved or by his representative in interest; (c) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in reasonable time; (d) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable; (e) when the original is a public document within the meaning of section 74; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: DRJ, © 2024 Delhi Reported Judgments. SCC Online Web Edition: https://www.scconline.com Printed For: Mr. Kushank Sindhu Page 7 Tuesday, November 05, 2024 SCC Online Web Edition, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt. Ltd. ~(!;<D® IONLINEf True Prinf 480 DELHI REPORTED JUDGMENTS 2009 (109) DRJ ... . (f) when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by this Act, or by any other law in force in India to be given in evidence; (g) when the originals consist of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in Court, and the fact to be proved is the general result of the whole collection. In cases (a), (c) and (d), any secondary evidence of the contents of the documents is admissible. In case (b), the written admission is admissible. In case (e) or (f), a .certified copy of the document, but no other kind of secondary evidence, is admissible. In case (g), evidence may be given as to the general result of the documents by any person who has examined them, and who is skilled in the examination of such documents. 66. Rules as to notice to produce. - Secondary evidence of the contents of the documents referred to in section 65, clause (a), shall not be given unless the party proposing to give such secondary evidence has previously given to the party in whose possession or power the document is, or to his attorney or pleader such notice to produce it as is prescribed by law; and if no notice is prescribed by law, then such notice as the Court considers reasonable under the circumstances of the case: , Provided that such notice shall not be required in order to render secondary evidence admissible in any of the following cases, or in any other case in which the Court thinks fit to dispense with it:- ( 1) when the document to be proved is itself a notice; (2) when from the nature of the case, the adverse party must know that he will be required to produce it; (3) when it appears or is proved that the adverse party has obtained possession of the original by fraud or force; (4) when the adverse party or his agent has the original in Court; (5) when the adverse party or his agent has admitted the loss of the document; · (6) when the person in possession of the document is out of reach, or not subject to, the process of the Court. (emphasis supplied)\" 17. On a reading of aforesaid Sections, I am of the view that application for secondary evidence on the ground of sub-section (c) of Section 65.IE Act should be allowed only when a court is absolutely sure that original documents have been destroyed or lost. In my view, if courts were to adopt a liberal approach in allowing secondary evidence to be led on the ground that original document has been lost or destroyed, then it would have very -serious adverse consequences for a person who may be in rightful possession of original of such a document because as and when he were to subsequently produce such an original document, the court may refuse to take cognizance of the same on the ground that some other court had prior in time given a finding that the said document had been lost or destroyed. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: DRJ, © 2024 Delhi Reported Judgments.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf Surinder Kaur v. Sardar Mangal Singh & Ors. 481 18. Keeping the above approach in mind, i am of the view that trial court has given cogent and reasonable reason for not treating original of documents referred to by petitioner as destroyed or lost. Moreover, I am of the view that in the present case, it cannot be said that originals of ~he aforesaid documents are out of reach or not subject to process of the court. In fact, in the present case, petitioner has not taken any step to either summon or issue a notice to present occupier of the neighbouring 110 square yards to find out as to whether they are still in possession of originals of the aforesaid documents. Consequently, in my opinion, sub-section (a) and sub-section (c) of Section 65 IE Act are not fulfilled in the present instance. 19. However, in my opinion, in view of the reply filed by respondents to petitioner's application under Order XIII Rule 2 CPC, existence and contents of aforesaid documents . stand admitted in writing by respondents themselves and consequently, sub-section (b) of Section 65 IE Act is attracted to facts of the present case and written admission of respondents is admissible. As far as Mr. Negi's reference to his reply affidavit to Section 65 application is concerned, in my opinion, it has to be read harmoniously and in conjunction with the reply filed by respondent to petitioner's application under Order XIII Rule 2 CPC, which I have already referred in extenso hereinabove. 20. In fact, on harmonious reading of replies to Order XIII Rule 2 and Section 65 of IE Act .applications, I am of the view that respondents have admitted that whatever documents were within the knowledge, power and possession of petitioner/plaintiffhave not been challenged and that the same are already on record. In fact, the respondents' consistent stand has been that said documents are irrelevant to present case as they have attained finality by efflux of time. Consequently sub-section(b) of Section 65 ofIE Act is clearly attracted to the present proceedings. · 21. Consequently, impugned orders dated 15th December, 1997 and 5th May, 1998 are set aside and petitioner's application under Section 65 of IE Act stands allowed. 22. In view ofaforesaid,parties are directed to appear on 23rd March, 2009 before the District & Sessions Judge-I, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi who shall assign the case to concerned Civil Judge in accordance with the roaster.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
