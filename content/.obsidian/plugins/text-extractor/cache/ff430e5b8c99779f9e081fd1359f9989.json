C The challenge made to the constitutional validity Of amendments ma.de to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 by Amendment Acts of 1999 and 2002 was rejected by this Court in Salem Advocates Bar Association, TN. v. Union of India, (2003) 1 sec 49, but it was noticed in that judgment D that modalities have to be formulated for the manner in which Section 89 of the Code and, for that matter, the other provisions which have been introduced by way of amendments might have to be operated. For this purpose, a Committee was constituted so as to ensure that the amendments become effective and result in quicker dispensation of justice. It was further observed that the Committee might consider devising a model case E management formula as well as rules and regulations whieh should be followed while taking recourse to the Alternate Dispute Resolution referred to in Section 89. Disposing of the petition, the Court HELD: 1. The affidavit required to be filed under the amended Section 26(2) and Order VI Rule 15(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 has the effect of fixing additional responsibility on the deponent as F to the truth of the facts stated in the pleadings. It is, however, made clear that such an affidavit would not be evidence for the purpose of the trial. G Further, on amendment of the pleadings, a fresh affidavit shall have to be filed in consonance thereof. (951-E] 2.1. The Court has already been vested with the power to permit affidavits to be filed as evidence as provided in Order XIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code. It has to be kept in view that the right of cross-examination H 936. SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. l S.C.R. A and re-examination in open Court has not been disturbed by Order XVIII Rule 4 inserted by amendment. It is true that after the amendment cross- exainination can be before a Commissioner but no exception can be taken in regard to the power of the legislature to amend the Code and provide for the examination-in-chief to be on affidavit or cross-examination before a Commissioner. The scope of Order XVIII Rule 4 had been examined B and its validity upheld in Salem Advocates Bar Association's case. There is also no question of inadmissible documents being read into evidence merely on account of such documents being given exhibit numbers in the affidavit filed by way of examination-in-chief. Further the trial Court in appropriate cases can permit the examination-in-chief to be recorded in the Court. The C proviso to Order XVIII Rule 4(2) clearly suggests that the Court has to apply its mind to the facts of the case, nature of allegations, nature of evidence and importance of the particular witness for determining whether the witness shall be examined in Court or by the Commissioner appointed by it. The power under Order XVIII Rule 4(2) is required to be exercised with great circumspection having regard to the facts and circumstances D of the case. It is not necessary to lay down hard and fast rules controlling the 'discretion of the Court to appoint a Commissioner to record cross- examination and re-examination of witnesses. The purpose would be served by noticing some illustrative cases which would serve as broad and general guidelines for the exercise of discretion. For instance, a case may E involve complex question of title, complex question in partition or suits relating to partnership business or suits involving serious allegations of fraud, forgery, and serious disputes as to the execution of the Will etc. In such cases, as far as possible, the Court may prefer to itself record the cross-examination of the material witnesses. (951-G-H; 952-A-D] F Salem Advocates Bar Association, T.N v. Union of India, [2003) I SCC 49, relied on. 2.2. Although when evidence is recorded by the Commissioner, the Court would be deprived of the benefit of watching the demeanour of G witnesses yet the will of the legislature, which has, by amending the Code, provided for recording evidence by the Commissioner for saving Court's time taken for the said purpose, cannot be defeated merely on the ground that the Court would be deprived of watching the demeanour of the witnesses. Further, in some cases, which are complex in nature, the prayer for recording evidence by the Commissioner may be declined by the Court. H In any case Order XVIII Rule 4, specifically provided that the SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. 937 ........... Commissioner may record such remarks as it thinks material in respect A of the demeanour of any witness while under examination. The Court would have the benefit of the observations if made by the Commissioner. (952-E, F, G] 3.1. In some States, advocates are being required to pass a test B conducted by the High Court in the subjects of Civil Procedure Code and Evidence Act for the purpose of empanelling them on the panels of Commissioners. It is a good practice. However, it is for the High Courts < to examine this aspect and decide to adopt or not such a procedure. .. (952-H] c 3.2. Regarding the apprehension that the payment of fee to the Commissioner will add to the burden of the litigant, generally the expenses incurred towards the fee payable to the Commissioner is likely to be less than the expenditure incurred for attending the Courts on various dates for recording of evidence besides the harassment and inconvenience to attend the Court again and again for the same purpose and, therefore, in D reality in most of the cases, there could be no additional burden. (953-A,·B] 4. Order XVIII Rule 19 which was inserted by the Amendment Act of 1999 overrides Order XVIII Rule 5 which provides the Court to record E evidence in all appealable cases. The Court is, therefore, empowered to appoint a Commissioner for recording of evidence in appealable cases as well. (953-E] 5.1. The discretion to declare a witness hostile has not been conferred on the Commissioner. The powers delegated to the Commissioner under F Order XXVI Rules 16, 16-A, 17 and 18 do not include the discretion that is vested in Court under Section 154 of the Evidence Act, 1872, to declare a witness hostile. (954-B) 5.2. If a situation as to declaring a witness hostile arises before a G Commission recording evidence, the concerned party shall have to obtain permission from the Court under Section 154 of the Evidence Act and it is only after grant of such permission that the Commissioner can allow a party to cross-examine his own witness. Having regard to the facts of the case, the Court may either grant such permission or even consider to ,• withdraw the Commission so as to itself record the remaining evidence H 938 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. I S.C.R. A or impose heavy costs if it finds that permission was sought to delay the r· .. progress of the suit or harass the opposite party. [954-C-D) 6. Undoubtedly, the Commissioner has to take proper care of the original documents handed over to him either by Court or filed before B him during recording of evidence. In this regard, the High Courts may frame necessary rules, regulations or issue practice directions so as to ensure safe and proper custody of the documents when the same are before the Commissioner. It is the duty and obligation of the Commissioners to keep the documents in safe custody and also not to give access of the record ~ to one party in absence of the opposite party or his counsel. The .... c Commissioners can be required to redeposit the documents with the Court in cases long adjournments are granted and for taking back the documents before the adjourned date. [954-E, F] 7. Even before insertion of Order XVIII Rule 17-A, the Court had inbuilt power to permit parties to produce evidence not known to them D earlier or which could not be produced in spite of due diligence. Order XVIII Rule 17-A did not create any new rights but only clarified the position. Therefore, deletion of Order XVIII Rule 17-A does not disentitle production of evidence at a later stage. On a party satisfying the Court that after exercise of due diligence that evidence was not within his· E knowledge or could not be produced at the time the party was leading evidence, the Court may permit leading of such evidence at a later stage on such terms as may appear to be just. [955-A, BJ Salem Advocates Bar Association, TN. v. Union of India, [2003) 1 SCC 49, relied on. F 8.1. The use of the word 'shall' in Order VIII Rule 1 by itself is not conclusive to determine whether the provision is mandatory or directory. The object which is required to be served by this provision and its design - and context in which it is enacted has to be ascertained. The use of the G word 'shall' is ordinarily indicative of the mandatory nature of the provision but having regard to the context in which is used or having regard to the intention of the legislation, the same can be construed as directory. The Rule in question has to advance the cause of justice and not to defeat it. The rules of procedure are made to advance the cause of justice and not to defeat it. Construction of the rule or procedure which H promotes justice and prevents miscarriage has to be preferred. The rules ~ ... SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.O.I. 939 ......... or procedure are handmaid of justice and not its mistress. In the presen~ A context, the strict interpretation would defeat justice. [959-B-C) 8.2. In construing Order VIII Rule 1, support can also be had from Order VIII Rule 10 which provides that where any party from whom a written statement is required under Rule 1 or Rule 9, fails to present the B same within the time permitted or fixed by the Court, the Court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. On failure to file written statement under this provision, the Court has been given the discretion either to pronounce .. judgment against the defendant or make such other order in relation to suit as it thinks fit. In the context of the provision, despite use of the word c 'shall', the Court has been given the discretion to pronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the defendant even if written statement is not filed and instead pass such order as it may think fit in relation to the suit. In construing the provision of Order VIII Rule 1 and Rule 10, the doctrine of harmonious construction is required to be applied. The D effect would be that under Rule 10 of Order VIII, the Court in its . discretion would have power to allow the defendant to file written statement even after expiry of period of 90 days provided in Order VIII Rule 1. There is no restriction in Order VIII Rule 10 that after expiry of ninety days, further time cannot be granted. The Court has wide power .... to 'make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit'. Clearly, E ,..._ therefore, the provision of Order VIII Rule 1 providing for upper limit of 90 days to file written statement is directory. 1957-D, G] 8.3. However, it is made clear that the order extending time to file the written statement cannot be made in routine. The time can be extended only in exceptionally hard cases. While extending time, it has to be borne F in mind that the legislature has fixed the upper time limit of 90 days. The discretion of the Court to extend the time shall not be so frequently and routinely exercised so as to nullify the period fixed by Order VIII Rule 1. [957-H; 958-A) ·Raza Buland Sugar Co. Ltd. v.

Section 39 of the Code does not authorize the Court to execute ~~ the decree outside its jurisdiction but it does not dilute the other provisions H ' 940 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (2005] SUPP. I S.C.R. A giving such power on compliance of conditions stipulated in those provisions. Thus, the provisions, such as, Order XXI Rule 3 or Order XXI Rule 48 which provide differently, would not be affected by Section 39(4) of the Code. (958-F] 9.2. The concept of registration has been introduced in Section 64(2) B of the Code to prevent false and frivolous cases of contracts being set up with a view to defeating the attachments. If the contract is registered and there is subsequent attachment, any sale deed executed after attachment will be valid. If it is unregistered, the subsequent sale after attachment would not be valid. Such sale would not be protected. There is no C ambiguity in Section 64(2). (959-A, BJ 10. The proviso to Order VJ Rule 17, to some extent, curtails absolute discretion to allow amendment at any stage. Now, if an application is filed after commencement of trial, it has to be shown that in spite of due diligence, such amendment could not have been sought earlier. The object D is to prevent frivolous applications which are filed to delay the trial. There is no illegality in the provision. (959-D] 11. The problem in respect of service of summons has been one of the major causes of delay in the due progress of the case. It is common E knowledge that the defendants have been avoiding to accept summons. There have been serious problems in process-serving agencies in various Courts. There can, thus, be no valid objection in giving opportunity to the plaintiff to serve the summons on the defendant or get it served through courier as provided in Order V Rule 9. There is, however, a danger of false reports of service. It is required to be adequately guarded. F The Courts shall have to be very careful while dealing with a case where orders for deemed service are required to be made on the basis of endorsement of such service or refusal. The High Courts can make appropriate rules and regulations or issue practice directions to ensure that such provisions of service are not abused so as to obtain false G endorsements. Jn this regard, the High Courts can consider making a provision for filing of affidavit setting out details of events at the time of refusal of service. For instance, it can be provided that the affidavit of person effecting service shall state as to who all were present at the time and also that the affidavit shall be in the language known to the deponent. It can also be provided that if the affidavit or any endorsement as to H service is found to be false, the deponent can be summarily tried and SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. 941 --~ punished for perjury and the courier company can be black-listed. The A guidelines as to the relevant details to be given can be issued by the High Courts. The High Courts, it is hoped, would issue as expeditiously as possible, requisite guidelines to the trial Courts by framing appropriate rules, order, regulations or practice directions. [959-G, H; 960-A-D] 12.1. The awarding of cost under Order XVII Rule 1(2) has been B made mandatory. Costs that can be awarded are of two types. First, cost ·~ occasioned by the adjournment and second such higher cost as the Court deems fit The provision for costs and higher costs has been made becau~e of practice having been developed to award only a nominal cost even then adjournment on payment of costs is granted. Ordinarily, where the costs c or higher costs are awarded, the same should be realistic and as far as possible actual cost that had to be incurred by the other party shall be awarded where the adjournment is found to be avoided but is being granted on account of either negligence or casual approach of a party or is being sought to delay the progress of the case or on any such reason. D {960-E; 961-C-D] 12.2. The provisos to Order XVII Rule 1 and Order XVII Rule 2 have to be read together. So read, Order XVII does not forbid grant of adjournment where the circumstances are beyond the control of the party. E In such a case, there is no restriction on the number of adjournments to be granted. It cannot be said that even if the circumstances are beyond the control of a party, after having obtained third adjournment, no further adjournment would be granted. There may be cases beyond the control of a party despite the party having obtained three adjournments. Fo-r instance, a party may be suddenly hospitalized on account of some serious F ailment or there may be serious accident or some act of God leading to devastation. It cannot be said that though circumstances may be beyond the control of a party, further adjournment cannot be granted because of restriction of three adjournments as provided in proviso to Order XVII Rule 1. In some extreme case, it may become necessary to grant a. adjournment despite the fact that three adjournments have already been granted (take the example of Bhopal Gas Tragedy, Gujarat earthquake and riots, devastation on account of Tsunami). Ultimately, it would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case, on the basis whereof the Court would decide to grant or refuse adjournment. (960-G-H; 961-A-Cl . ./ f 942 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. I S.C.R. A 13.1. Further, to save the proviso to Order XVII Rule l from the ''ice of Article 14 of the Constitution it is necessary to read it down so as not to take away the discretion of the Court in the extreme hard cases as noted above. The limitation of three adjournments would not apply where adjournment is to be granted on account of circumstances beyond the B control of a party. Even in cases which may not strictly come within the category of circumstances beyond the control of a party, the Court by resorting to the provision of higher cost which can also include punitive cost in the discretion of the Court, adjournment beyond three can be granted having regard to the injustice that may result on refusal thereof, with reference to peculiar facts of a case. [961-D, E, F] c 13.2. However, grant of any adjournment let alone first, second or third adjournment is not a right of a party. The grant of adjournment by a Court has to be on a party showing special and extraordinary circumstances. It cannot be in routine. While considering the prayer for D grant of adjournment, it is necessary to keep in mind the legislative intent to restrict grant of adjournments. (961-G] 14.l. The omission of Order XVIII Rule 2(4) by the 1999 amendment docs not take away the Court's inherent power to call for any witness at any stage either suo moto or on the prayer of a party invoking the inherent E powers of the Court. (962-B) 14.2. The object of filing written arguments or fixing time limit of oral arguments as laid down in Order XVIII Rule 2 sub-rules (3-A) to (3- D) is with a view to saving time of the Court. The adherence to the p requirement of these rules is likely to help in administering fair and speedy justice. (962-C) 15. In Order VII Rule 14(4) the words 'plaintiffs witnesses' have been mentioned as a result of mistake seems to have been committed by the legislature. The words ought to be 'defendant's witnesses'. Till the G legislature corrects the mistake, the words 'plaintifPs witnesses' would be read as 'defendant's witnesses' in Order VII Rule 14(4). [963-BJ 16. Sections 35, 35-A and 95 of the Code deal with three different aspects of award of cost and compensation. Under Section 95 cost can be H awarded up to Rs. 50,000 and under Section 35-A, the costs awardable • .) SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON ., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. 943 are up to Rs. 3,000. The award of the cost of the suit is in the discretion A of the Court. In Sections 35 and 35-B, there is no upper limit of amount of cost awardable. (963-C, D, EJ 17. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that many unscrupulous parties take advantage of the fact that either the costs are not awarded B or nominal costs are awarded on the unsuccessful party. Unfortunately, it has become a practice to direct the parties to bear their own costs. In large number of cases, such an order is passed despite Section 35(2) of the Code. Such a practice also encourages filing of frivolous suits. It also leads to taking up of frivolous defences. Further, wherever costs are awarded, ordinarily the same are not realistic and are nominal. When C Section 35(2) provides for cost to follow the event, it is implicit that the costs have to be those which are reasonably incurred by a successful party except in those cases where the Court in its discretion may direct otherwise by recording reasons therefor. The costs have to be actual reasonable costs including the cost of the time spent by the successful party, the D transportation and lodging, if any, or any other incidental cost besides the payment of the Court fee, lawyer's fee, typing and other cost in relation to the litigation. It is for the High Courts to examine these aspects and wherever necessary make requisite rules, regulations or practice direction so as to provide appropriate guidelines for the subordinate Courts to follow. [963-G, H; 964-A-B] E 18.1. The two months' period mentioned in Section 80(1) of the Code has been provided for so that the Government shall examine the claim put up in the notice and has sufficient time to send a suitable reply. The underlying object is to curtail the litigation. The object also is to curtail the area of dispute and controversy. Similar provisions also exist in various other legislations as well. Wherever the statutory provision requires the service of notice as a condition precedent for filing of suit and prescribed period therefor, it is not only necessary for the governments or departments or other statutory bodies to send a reply to such a notice but F it is further necessary to properly deal with all material points and issues G raised in the notice. The Gover.nments, Government departments or statutory authorities are defendants in large number of suits pending in various Courts in the country. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that in large number of cases either the notice is not replied or in a few cases where reply is sent, it is generally vague and evasive. The result is that H 944 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. I S.C.R. A the object underlying Section 80 of the Code and similar provisions gets defeated. It not only gives rise to avoidable litigation but also results in heavy expense and cost to the exchequer as well. Proper reply can result in reduction of litigation between State and the citizens. In case proper reply is sent either the claim in the notice may be admitted or area of B controversy curtailed or the citizen may be satisfied on knowing the stand of the State. There is no accountability in the Government, Central or State or the statutory authorities in violating the spirit and object of Section 80. (964-D, E, F, G] 18.1. These provisions cast an implied duty on all concerned C Governments and State and statutory authorities to send appropriate reply to such notices. Having regnd to the existing state of affairs, it is directed that all concerned Governments, Central or State or other authorities, whenever any statute requires service of notice as a condition precedent for filing of suit or other proceedings against it, to nominate, within a D period of three months, an Officer who shall be made responsible to ensure that replies to notices under Section 80 or similar provisions are sent within the period stipulated in a particular legislation. The replies shall be sent after due application of mind. Despites such nomination, if the Court finds that either the notice has not been replied or reply is evasive and vague and has been sent without proper application of mind, the Court shall E ordinarily award heavy cost against the Government and direct it to take appropriate action against the concerned Officer including recovery of costs from him. (964-H; 965-A-C] F 19. The power of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution is always in addition to the revisional jurisdiction conferred on it. Curtailment of revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 115 of the Code as amended by Amendment Act 46 of 1999 does not take away and could not have taken away the constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court. The power exists, untrammeled by the amendment in Section 115 and is available to be exercised subject to rules G of self-discipline and practice which are well settled. [966-A, Bl Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai, [2003) 6 SCC 675, relied on. 20.1. The upper limit of 30 days fixed in Section 148 of the Code H cannot take away the inherent power of the Court to pass orders as may SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. 945 be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of process of Court. A The rigid operation of the Section would lead to absurdity. Section 151 has, therefore, to be allowed to fully operate. Extension beyond the maximum of 30 days, thus, can be permitted if the act could not be performed within 30 days for the reasons beyond the control of the party. However, Section 148 does not apply to cases to which the Limitation Act, B 1963 is applicable. (966-D, E) 20.2. There can be many cases where non-grant of extension beyond 30 days would amount to failure of justice. The object of the Code is not to promote failure of justice. Section 148, therefore, deserves to be read down to mean that where sufficient cause exists or events are beyond the C control of a party, the Court would have inherent power to extend time beyond 30 days. (967-C) Mahanth Ram Das v. Ganga Das, AIR (1961) SC 882, relied on. 21.1. The period of seven days mentioned in Order IX Rule 5 is clearly directory. [967-D] 21.2. The stipulation in Rule 15 of Order XI confining the inspection of documents 'at or before the settlement of issues' instead of 'at any ti.me' D is also nothing but directory. It does not mean that the inspection cannot E be allowed after the settlement of issues. (967-E] 22.1. The Committee has suggested that the Central Government has to provide substantial funds for establishing Courts which are subordinate to the High Court and the Planning Commission and the Finance F .Commission must make adequate provisions therefor. [968-F] 22.2. The Committee has also suggested that there must be 'judicial impact assessment', as done in the United States, whenever any legislation is introduced either in Parliament or State Legislatures. The financial memorandum attached to each Bill must estimate not only the budgetary G requirement of other staff but also the budgetary requirement for meeting the expenses of the additional cases that may arise out of the new Bill when it is passed by the legislature. The said budget must mention the number of civil and criminal cases likely to be generated by the new Act, how many Courts are necessary, how many Judges and staff are necessary and what H 946 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. l S.C.R. A is the infrastructure necessary. So far in the last fifty years such a judicial impact assessment has never been made by any legislature or by Parliament in our country. (968-G, H; 969-A-B] 22.3. Having regard to the constitutional obligation to provide fair, B quick and speedy justice, the Central Government is directed to examine the aforesaid suggestions and submit a report to this Court within four months. (969-C] 23. As can be seen from Section 89 of the Code, its first part uses the word 'shall' when it stipulates that the 'Court shall formulate terms C of settlement'. The use of the word 'may' in the later part of Section 89 only relates to the aspect of reformulating the terms of a possible settlement. The intention of the legislature behind enacting Section 89 is that where it appears to the Court that there exists an element of a settlement which may be acceptable to the parties, they, at the inst1,1nce D of the Court, shall be made to apply their minds so as to opt for one or the other of the four Alternative Dispute Resolution methods mentioned in the Section and if the parties do not agree, the Court shall refer them to one or the other of the said modes. Section 89 uses both the word 'shall' and 'may' whereas Order X Rule 1-A uses the word 'shall' but on harmonious reading of these provisions it becomes clear that the use of E the word 'may' in Section 89 only governs the aspect of reformulation of the terms of a possible settlement and its reference to one of the ADR methods. There is no conflict. It is evident that what is referred to one of the ADR modes is the dispute which is summarized in the terms of settlement formulated or reformulated in terms of Section 89. [971-B-E] F 24.1. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 governs a case where arbitration is agreed upon before or pending a suit by all the parties. The 1996 Act, however, does not contemplate a situation a·s in Section 89 of the Code where the· Coui:t asks the parties to choose one or the other G ADRs including Arbitration ana the parties choose Arbitration as their option. Of course, the parties have to agree for Arbitration. Section 82 of the 1996 Act enables the High Court to make Rules consistent with this Act as to all proceedings before the Court under the 1996 Act. Section 84 enables the Central Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. The procedure for option to Arbitration among the H four ADRs is not contemplated by the 1996 Act and, therefore, Sections SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. 947 82 or 84 has no applicability where the parties agree to go for arbitration A under Section 89 of the Code. For the purposes of Section 89 and Order X, Rules 1-A, 1-B and 1-C, the relevant Section in Part X of the Code enable the High Court to frame rules. If reference is made to Arbitration under Section 89 of the Code, the 1996 Act would apply only from the stage after reference and not before the stage of reference when options B under Section 89 are given by the Court and chosen by the parties. On the same analogy, the 1996 Act in relation to Conciliation would apply only after the stage of reference to Conciliation. The 1996 Act does not deal with a situation where after the suit is filed, the Court requires a party to choose one or the other ADRs including Conciliation. Thus, for Conciliation also rules can be made under Part X of the Code for the C purposes of procedure for opting for 'Conciliation' and up to the stage of reference to 'Conciliation'. Thus, there is no impediment in the ADR rules being framed in relation to Civil Court as contemplated in Section 89 up to the stage of reference to ADR. The 1996 Act comes into play only after the stage of reference up to the award. [971-F-H; 972-A-D] D P. Anand Gajapathi Raju v. P. V.G. Raju, [2000] 4 SCC 539, relied on. 24.2. Applying the same analogy, the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 or the Rules framed thereunder by the State Govern'ments cannot act as impediment in the High Court making rules under Part X of the E Code covering the manner in which the option to Lok Adalat can be made being one of the modes provided in Section 89. The 1987 Act also does not deal with the aspect of exercising option to one of the four ADR methods mentioned in Section 89. Section 89 makes applicable the 1996 Act and the 1987 Act from the stage after the exercis·e of options and F making of n:ference. (972-D-E] 25. It is evident that all the four alternatives, namely, Arbitration, Conciliation, judicial settlement including settlement through Lok Adalat and mediation are meant to be the actions of persons or institutions outside G the Court and not before the Court. Order X, Rule 1-C speaks of the 'Conciliation forum' referring back the dispute to the Court. In fact, the Court is not involved in the actual mediation/conciliation. Section 89(2)(d) only means that when mediation succeeds and parties agree to the terms of settlement, the mediator will report to the Court and the Court, after giving notice and hearing the parties, 'effect' the compromise and pass a H 948 . SUPREME COURT REPORT~ (2005] SUPP. I S'.C.R. A decree in accordance with the terms of settlement accepted by the parties. Further, there is no question of the Court which refers the matter to mediation/conciliation being debarred from hearing the matter where settlement is not arrived at. The Judge who makes the reference only considers the limited question as to whether there are reasonable, grounds B to expect that there will be settlement and on that ground he cannot be treated to be disqualified to try the suit afterwards if no settlement is arrived at between the parties. [972-F, G, H; 973-A-B] 26.1. The Central Government is directed to examine the suggestion that expenditure on compulsory reference to conciliation/mediation be C borne by the Government and if it is agreed, it shall request the Planning Commission and the Finance Commission to make specific financial allocation for the judiciary for including the expenses involved for mediation/conciliation under Section 89 of the Code. In case, the Central Government has any reservations, the same shall be placed before this D Court within four months. [973-D] 26.2. With a view to enabling the Court to refer the parties to conciliation/mediation, where the parties are unable to reach a consensus on an agreed name, there should be a panel of well trained conciliat.?rs/ mediators to which it may be possible for the Court to make a reference. E It would be necessary for the High Courts and district Courts to take appropriate steps in the direction of preparing the requite panels. (973-F, G] 27. The Family Courts Act, 1984 applies the Code for all proceedings F before it. Therefore, ADR rules made under the Code can be applied to supplement the rules made under the Family Courts Act and provide for ADR insofar as conciliation/mediation is concerned. [973-H; 974-AJ 28. There is a fine distinction between conciliation and mediation. Jn 'conciliation' there is a little more latitude and conciliator can suggest G some terms of settlements too. (974-B) 29. When the parties come to a settlement upon a reference made by the Court for mediation, as suggested by the Committee there has to be some public record of the manner in which the suit is disposed of and, H therefore the Court has to first record the settlement and pass a decree L.. SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. 949 in terms thereof and if necessary proceed to execute it in accordance with A . law. It cannot be accepted that such a procedure would be unnecessary. If the settlement is not filed in the Court for the purpose of passing of a decree, there will be no public record of the settlement. It is, however, a different matter ifthe parties do not want the Court to record a settlement and pass a decree and feel that the settlement can be implemented even B without a decree. In such an eventuality, nothing prevents them from informing the Court that the suit may be dismissed as the dispute has been settled between the parties outside the Court. (974-C, DJ 30. Regarding the refimd of the Court fee where the matter is settled by the reference to one of the modes provided in Section 89 of the Code, C it is for the State Governments to amend the laws on the lines of the ~- amendment made in the Central Court Fee Act by Act 46 of the 1999 Amendment to the Code. The State Governments can consider making similar amendments in the State Court Fee legislations. (974-E, F) 31.1. The draft ADR and Mediation Rules have been finalised by the Committee and now it is for the respective High Courts to take appropriate steps for making rules in exercise of the rule-making power subject to modifications, if any, which may be considered relevant. [974-F, G] D 31.2. The High Courts can examine the Model Case Flow E Management Rules, discuss the matter and consider the question of adopting or making case law management and model rules with or without modification, so that a step forward is taken to provide to the litigating public a fair, speedy and inexpensive justice. (995-B) 32. It is hoped that the High Courts in the country would be in a position to examine the aforesaid rules expeditiously and would be able to finalise the Rules within a period of four months. The Registrar Generals, the Central Government and the State/Union Territories shall F file the progress reports in regard to the action taken within a period of G four months.

The challenge made to the constitutional validity of amendments made to the Code of Civil Procedure (for short, 'the Code') by Amendment Acts of 1999 and 2002 was rejected by this Court (Salem Advocates Bar Association, T.N. v. Union of India, [2003] 1 SCC 49),. E but it was noticed in the judgment that modalities have to be formulated for the manner in which Section 89 of the Code and, for that matter, the other provisions which have been introduced by way of amendments, may have to be operated. For this purpose, a Committee headed by a former Judge of this Court and Chairman, Law Commission oflndia (Justice M. Jagannadha Rao) was constituted so as to ensure that the amendments become effective and F result in quicker dispensation of justice. It was further observed that the Committee may consider devising a model case management formula as well as rules and regulations which should be followed while taking recourse to the Alternate Disputes Resolution (ADR) referred to in Section 89. It was also observed that the model rules, with or without modification, which are G formulated may be adopted by the High Courts concerned for giving effect to Section 89(2)(d) of the Code. Further, it was observed that if any difficulties are felt in the working of the amendments, the same can be placed before the Committee which would consider the same and make necessary suggestions in its report. The Committee has filed the report. H The report is in three parts. Report 1 contains the consideration of the -4 - SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.] 951 various grievances relating to amendments to the Code and the A recommendations of the Committee. Report 2 contains the consideration of various points raised in connection with draft rules for ADR and mediation as envisaged by Section 89 of the Code read with Order X Rule 1 A, 1 B and 1 C. It also contains model Rules. Report 3 contains a conceptual appraisal of case management. It also contains the model rules of case management. First, we will consider Report 1 which deals with the amendments made to the Code. Report No.I B Amendment inserting sub-section (2) to Section 26 and Rule 15( 4) to Order C VI Rule 15. Prior to insertion of aforesaid provisions, there was no requirement of filing affidavit with the pleadings. These provisions now require the plaint to be accompanied by an affidavit as provided in Section 26(2) and the person verifying the pleadings to furnish an affidavit in support of the pleading D [Order VI Rule 15(4)]. It was sought to be contended that the requirement of filing an affidavit is illegal and unnecessary in view of the existing requirement of verification of the pleadings. We are unable to agree. The affidavit required to be filed under amended Section 26(2) and Order VI Rule 15(4) of the Code has the effect of fixing additional responsibility on the deponent as to E the truth of the facts stated in the pleadings. It is, however, made clear that such an affidavit would not be evidence for the purpose of the trial. Further, on amendment of the pleadings, a fresh affidavit shall have to be filed in consonance thereof. Amendment of Order XVIII Rule 4 The amendment provides that in every case, the examination-in-chief F of a witness shall be on affidavit. The Court has already been vested with power to permit affidavits to be filed as evidence as provided in Order XIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code. It has to be kept in view that the right of cross- examination and re-examination in open court has not been disturbed by G Order XVIII Rule 4 inserted by amendment. It is true that after the amendment cross-examination can be before a Commissioner but we feel that no exception can be taken in regard to the power of the legislature to amend the Code and provide for the examination-in-chief to be on affidavit or cross-examination before a Commissioner. The scope of Order XVIII Rule 4 has been examined H 952 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. I S.C.R. A and its validity upheld in Salem Advocates Bar Association's case. There is also no question of inadmissible documents being read into evidence merely on account of such documents being given exhibit numbers in the affidavit filed by way of examination-in-chief. Further, in Salem Advocates Bar Association's case, it has been held that the trial court in appropriate cases B can pennit the examination-in-chief to be recorded in the Court. Proviso to sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 of Order XVHI clearly suggests that the court has to apply its mind to the facts of the case, nature of allegations, nature of evidence and importance of the particular witness for determining whether the witness shall be examined in court or by the Commissioner appointed by it. The power under. Order XVIII Rule 4(2) is required to be exercised with great C circumspection having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case. It is not necessary to lay down hard and fast rules controlling the discretion of the court to appoint Commissioner to record cross-examination and re- examination of witnesses. The purpose would be served by noticing some illustrative cases which would serve as broad and general guidelines for the exercise of discretion. For instance, a case may involve complex question of .. D title, complex question in partition or suits relating to partnership business or ' suits involving serious allegations of fraud, forgery, serious disputes as to the execution of the will etc. iln such cases, as far as possible, the court may prefer to itselfrecord the cross-examination of the material witnesses. Another contention raised is that when evidence is recorded by the Commissioner, the E Court would be deprived of the benefit of watching the demeanour of witness. That may be so but, in our view, the will of the legislature, which has by amending the Code provided for recording evidence by the Commissioner for saving Court's time taken for the said purpose, cannot be defeated merely on the ground that the Court would be deprived of watching the demeanour of the witnesses. Further, as noticed above, in some cases, which are com pie~ F in nature, the prayer for recording evidence by the Commissioner may be declined by the Court. It may also be noted that Order XVIII Rule 4, specifically provides that the Commissioner may record such remarks as it thinks material in respect of the demeanour of any witness while under examination. The Court would have the benefit of the observations if made G by the Commissioner. The report notices that in some States, advocates are being required to pass a test conducted by the High Court in the subjects of Civil Procedure Code and Evidence Act for the purpose of empanelling them on the panels of Commissioners. It is a good practice_~ We would, however, leave it to the H High Courts to examine this aspect and~ecide to adopt or not such a procedure. SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.] 953 Regarding the apprehension that the payment of fee to the Commissioner will A add to the burden of the litigant, we feel that generally the expenses incurred towards the fee payable to the Commissioner is likely to be less than expenditure incurred for attending the Courts on various dates for recording evidence besides the harassment and inconvenience to attend the Court again and again for the same purpose and, therefore, in reality in most of the cases, B there could be no additional burden. Amendment to Order XVIII Rule 5(a) and (b) was made in 1976 whereby it was provided that in all appealable cases evidence shall be recorded by the Court. Order XVIII Rule 4 was amended by Amendment Act of 1999 and again by Amendment Act of 2002. Order XVIII Rule 4(3) enables the C commissioners to record evidence in all type of cases including appealable cases. The contention urged is that there is conflict between these provisions. To examine the contention, it is also necessary to keep in view Order XVIII Rule 19 which was inserted by Amendment Act of 1999. It reads as under: \"Power to get statements recorded on commission-Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, the Court may, instead of examining witnesses in open Court, direct their statements to be recorded. on commission under rule 4A of the Order XXVI.\" The aforesaid provision contains a non-obstante clause. It overrides Order XVIII Rule 5 which provides the court to record evidence in all appealable cases. The Court is, therefore, empowered to appoint a Commissioner for recording of evidence in appealable cases as well. Further, Order XXVI Rule 4-A inserted by Amendment Act of 1999 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules, any court may in the interest of justice or for the expeditious disposal of the case or for any other reason, issue Commission in any suit for the examination of any person resident within the local limits of the court's jurisdiction. Order XVIII Rule 19 and Order XXVI Rule 4-A, in our view, would override Order XVIII Rule 5(a) and (b). There is, thus, no conflict. The next question that has. been raised is about the power of the Commissioner to declare a witness hostile. Order XVIII Rule 4(4) requires D/ E F G that any objection raised during the recording of evidence before the Commissioner shall be recorded by him and decided by the Court at the stage H 954 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005) SUPP. I S.C.R. A of arguments .. Order XVIII Rule 4(8) stipulates that the provisions of Rules 16, 16-A, 17 and 18 of Order XXVI, in so far as they are applicable, shall apply to the issue, execution and return of such commission thereunder. The discretion to declare a witness hostile has not been conferred on the Commissioner. Under Section 154 of the Evidence Act, it is the Court which B has to grant permission, in its discretion, to a person who calls a witness, to put any question to that witness which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party. The powers delegated to the Commissioner under Order XXVI Rules 16, 16-A, 17 and 18 do not include the discretion that is vested in Court under Section 154 of the Evidence Act to declare a witness hostile. C If a situation as to declaring a witness hostile arises before a Commission recording evidence, the concerned party shall have to obtain pennission from the Court under Section 154 of the Evidence Act and it is only after grant of such pennission that the Commissioner can allow a party to cross-examine his own witness. Having regard to the facts of the case, the Court may either grant such permission or even consider to withdraw the commission so as to D itself record remaining evidence or impose heavy costs if it finds that permission was sought to delay the progress of the suit or harass the opposite party. Another aspect is about proper care to be taken by the Commission of ' the original documents. Undoubtedly, the Commission has to take proper E care of the original documents handed over to him either by Court or filed before him during recording of evidence. In this regard, the High Courts may frame necessary rules, regulations or issue practice directions so as to ensure safe and proper custody of the documents when the same are before the Commissioner. It is the duty and obligation of the Commissioners to keep the p documents in safe custody and also not to give access of the record to one party in absence of the opposite party or his counsel. The Commissioners can be required to redeposit the documents with the Court in case long adjournments are granted and for taking back the documents before the adjourned date. G Additional Evidence H In Salem Advocates Bar Association's case, it has been clarified that on deletion of Order XVIII Rule 17-A which provided for leading of additional evidence, the law existing before the introduction of the amendment, i.e., lst July, 2002, would stand restored. The Rule was deleted by Amendment Act I A SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. (SABHARWAL, J.] 955 of 2002. Even before insertion of Order XVIII Rule 17-A, the Court had A inbuilt power to permit parties to produce evidence not known to them earlier or which could not be produced in spite of due diligence. Order XVIII Rule 17-A did not create any new right but only clarified the position. Therefore, deletion of Order XVIII Rule 17-A does not disentitle production of evidence at a later stage. On a party satisfying the Court that after exercise of due diligence that evidence was not within his knowledge or could not be produced B at the time the party was leading evidence, the Court may permit leading of such evidence at a later stage on such terms as may appear to be just. Order VIII Rule I Order VIII Rule l, as amended by Act 46 of 1999 provides that the C defendant shall within 30 days from the date of service of summons on him, present a written statement of his defence. The rigour of this provision was reduced by Amendment Act 22 of 2002 which enables the Court to extend time for filing written statement, on recording sufficient reasons therefor, but the extension can be maximum for 90 days. D The question is whether the Court has any power or jurisdiction to extend the period beyond 90 days. The maximum period of 90 days to file written statement has been provided but the consequences on failure to file written statement within the said period have not been provided for in Order VIII Rule 1. The point for consideration is whether the provision providing E for maximum period of ninety days is mandatory ·and, therefore, the Court is altogether powerless to extend the time even in an exceptionally hard case. It has been common practice for the parties to take long adjournments for filing written statements. The legislature with a view to curb this practice and to avoid unnecessary delay and adjournments, has provided for the F maximum period within which the written statement is required to be filed. The mandatory or directory nature of Order VIII Rule 1 shall have to be determined by having regard to the object sought to be achieved by the amendment. It is, thus, necessary to find out the intention of the legislature. The consequences which may follow and whether the same were intended by G the legislature have also to be kept in view. In Raza Buland Sugar Co. Ltd, Rampur v. The Municipal Board, Rampur, AIR (1965) SC 895, a Constitution Bench of this Court held that the question whether a particular provision is mandatory or directory cannot be resolved by laying down any general rule and it would depend upon the facts H 956 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (2005) SUPP. I S.C.R. . A of each case and for that purpose the object of the statute in making out the provision is the determining factor. The purpose for which the provision has been made and its nature, the intention of the legislature in making the provision, the serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons resulting from whether the provision is read one way or the other, the relation of the B particular provision to other provisions dealing with the same subject and other considerations which may arise on the facts of a particular case including the language of the provision, have all to be taken into account in arriving at the .concll.lsion whether a particular proviSion is mandatory or directory~ InS~ngram Singhv: Election Tribunaf1(otah rind Anr., AIR (1955) SC C. 425, consider.ing the provisions of the Code dealing with the trial of the suits, it was opined that: \"Now a code of procedure must be regarded as such. It is procedure, something designed to facilitate justice and further its ends: not a Penal enactment for punishment and penalties; not a thing designed D to trip people up. Too technical construction of sections that leaves no room for.reasonable elasticity of interpretation should therefore be guarded against (provided always that justice is done to both sides) lest the very means designed for the furtherance of justice be used to frustrate it. E F Next, there must be ever present to the mind the fact that our laws of procedure are grounded on a principle of natural justice which requires that men should not be condemned unheard, that decisions should not be reached behind their backs, that proceedings.that affect their Jives and property should not continue in their absence and that they should not be precluded from participating in them. Of course, there must be exceptions and where they are clearly defined they must be given effect to. But taken by and large, and subject to that proviso, our laws of procedure should be construed, wherever that is reasonably possible, in the light of that principle. \" In [opline Shoes Ltd. v. Corporation Bank, [2002] 6 .SCC 33, the G question f6rfonsideratioh was\"wliether the State Consumer Disputes Redressal . · Commissi(m could grant tiine to the respondent to file ~eply beyond total period of4S days in view of Section 13(2) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It was held that the intention to provide time frame to file reply is really made to expedite the hearing of such matters and avoid unnecessary H adjournments. It was noticed that no penal consequences had been prescribed .. - ~ SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.]. 957 if the reply is not filed in the prescribed time. The provision was held to be A directory .. It was observed that the provision is more by way of procedure to achieve the object of speedy disposal of the case. The use of the word 'shall' in Order VIII Rule I by itself is not conclusive to determine whether the provision is mandatory or directory. We have to ascertain the object which is required to be served by this provision B and its design and context in which it is enacted. The use of the word 'shall' is ordinarily indicative of mandatory nature of the provision but having regard to the context in which it ·is used or having regard to the intention of the legislation, the same can be construed as directory. The rule in question has to advance the cause of justice and not to defeat it. The rules of procedure C are made to advance the cause of justice and not to defeat it. Construction of the rule or procedure which promotes justice and prevents miscarriage has to be preferred. The rules or procedure are handmaid .of justice and not its mistress. In the present context, the strict interpretation would defeat justice. In construing this provision, support can also be had from Order VIII D Rule l 0 which provides that where any party from whom a written statement is required under Rule l or Rule 9, fails to present the same within the time permitted or fixed by the Court, the Court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. On failure to file written statement under this provision, the Court has been given the discretion either to pronounce judgment against the defendant or make such E other order in relation to suit as it thinks fit. In the context of the provision, despite use of the word 'shall', the court has been given the .discretion to pronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the defendant even if written statement is not. filed and instead pass such order as it may think fit in relation to the suit. In construing the provision of Order VIII Rule I and p Rule I 0, the doctrine of harmonious construction is required to be applied. The effect would be that under Rule I 0 of Order VIII, the court in its discretion would have power to allow the defendant to file written statement even after expiry of period of 90 days provided in Order VIII Rule I. There is no restriction in Order VIII Rule I 0 that after expiry of ninety days, further time cannot be granted. The Court has wide power to 'make such order in relation G to the suit as it thinks fit'. C.learly, therefore, the provision of Order VIII Rule I providing for upper limit of 90 days to file written statement is directory. Having said so, we wish to make it'clear that the order extending time to file written statement cannot be made in routine. The time can be extended only in exceptionally hard cases. While extending time, it has to be borne in mind H 958 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (2005) SUPP. 1 S.C.R. A that the legislature has fixed the upper time limit of 90 days. The discretion of the Court to extend the time shall not be so frequently and routinely exercised so as to nullify the period fixed by Order VIII Rule 1. Section 39 B Section 39(1) of the Code provides that the Court which passed a decree may, on the application of the decree-holder send it for execution to another court of competent jurisdiction. By Act 22 of 2002, Section 39( 4) has been inserted providing that nothing in the section shall be deemed to authorise the Court which passed a decree to execute such decree against any person C or property outside the local limits of its jurisdiction. The question is whether this newly added provision prohibits the executing court from executing a decree against a person or property outside its jurisdiction and whether this provision overrides Order XXI Rule 3 and Order XXI Rule 48 or whether these provisions continue to be an exception to Section 39(4) as was the legal position before the amendment. D Order XXI Rule 3 provides that where immoveable property forms one estate or tenure situate within the local limits of the jurisdiction of two or more courts, any one of such courts may attach and sell the entire estate or tenure. Likewise, under Order XXI Rule 48, attachment of salary of a Government servant, Railway servant or servant of local authority can be E made by the court whether the judgment-debtor or the disbursing officer is or is not within the local _limits of the court's jurisdiction. Section 39 does not authorise the Court to execute the decree outside its jurisdiction but it does not dilute the other provisions giving such power on compliance of conditions stipulated in those provisions. Thus, the_ F provisions, such as, Order XXI Rule 3 or Order XXI Rule 48 which provide differently, would not be effectea by Sect.ion 39(4) of the Code. Section 64(2) Section 64(2) in the Code has been inserted by Amendment Act 22 of G 2002. Section 64, as it originally stood, has been renumbered as Section 64(1). Section 64(1), inter alia, provides that where an attachment has been made, any private transfer or delivery of property attached or of any interest therein contrary to such attachment shall be void as against all claims enforceable under the attachment. Sub-section (2) protects the aforesaid acts H if made in pursuance of any contract for such transfer or delivery entered into -- SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.] 959 / and registered before the attachment. The concept of registration has been A introduced to prevent false and frivolous cases of contracts being set up with a view to defeat the attachments. If the contract is registered and there is subsequent attachment, any sale deed executed after attachment will be valid. If it is unregistered, the subsequent sale after attachment would not be valid. Such sale would not be protected. There is no ambiguity in sub-section (2) B of Section 64. Order VI Rule I 7 Order VI Rule 17 of the Code deals with amendment of pleadings. By Amendment Act 46 of 1999, this provision was deleted. It has again been c restored by Amendment Act 22 of 2002 but with an added proviso to prevent application for amendment being allowed after the trial has commenced, unless court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised the matter before the commencement of trial. The proviso, to some extent, curtails absolute discretion to allow amendment at any stage. Now, if application is filed after commencement of trial, it has to D be shown that in spite of due diligence, such amendment could not have been sought earlier. The object is to prevent frivolous applications which are filed to delay the trial. There is no illegality in the provision. Service through Courier E Order V Rule 9, inter alia, permits service of summons by party or through courier. Order V Rule 9(3) and Order V Rule 9-A permit service of summons by courier or by the plaintiff. Order V Rule 9(5) requires the court to declare that the summons had been duly served on the defendant on the contingencies mentioned in the provision. It is in the nature of deemed service. F The apprehension expressed is that service outside the normal procedure is likely to lead to false reports of service and passing of ex parte decrees. It is further urged that courier's report about defendant's refusal to accept service is also likely to lead to serious malpractice and abuse. While considering the submissions of learned counsel, it has to be G borne in mind that problem in respect of service of summons has been one of the major causes of delay ip the due progress of the case. It is common knowledge that the defendants have been avoiding to accept summons. There have been serious problems in process serving agencies in various courts. '( There can, thus, be no valid objection in giving opportunity to the plaintiff to serve the summons on the defendant or get it served through courier. H 960 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005) SUPP. 1 S.C.R. A There is, however, danger of false reports of service. It is required to be adequately guarded. The courts shall have to be very careful while dealing with a case where orders for deemed service are required to be made on the basis of endorsement of such service or refusal. The High Courts can make appropriate rules and regulations or issue practice directions to· ensure that such provisions of service are not abused so as to obtain false endorsements. B In this regard, the High Courts can consider making a provision for filing of affidavit setting out details of events at the time of refusal of service. For instance, it can be provided that the affidavit of person effecting service shall state as to who all were present at that time and also that the affidavit shall be in the language known to the deponent. It can also be provided that if C affidavit or any endorsement as to service is found to be false, the deponent can be summarily tried and punished for perjury and the courier company can be black-listed. The guidelines as to the relevant details to be given can be issued by the High Courts. The High Courts, it is hoped, would issue as expeditiously as possible, requisite guidelines to the trial courts by framing appropriate rules, order, regulations or practice directions. D Adjournments Order XVII of the Code relates to grant of adjournments. Two amendments have been made therein. One that adjournment shall not be granted to a party more than three times during hearing of the suit. The other E relates to cost of adjournment. The awarding of cost has been made mandatory. Costs that can be awarded are of two types. First, cost occasioned by the adjournment and second such higher cost as the court deems fit. While examining the scope of proviso to Order XVII Rule I that more F than three adjournments shall not be granted, it is to be kept in view that proviso to Order XVII Rule 2 incorporating clauses (a) to (e) by Act 104 of I 976 has been retained. Clause (b) stipulates that no adjournment shall be granted at the request of a party, except where the circumstances are beyond the control of that party. The proviso to Order XVII Rule 1 and Order XVII Rule 2 have to be read together. So read, Order XVII does not forbid grant G of adjournment where the circumstances are beyond the control of the party. In such a case, there is no restriction on number of adjournments to be granted. It cannot be said that even if the circumstances are beyond the control of a party, after having obtained third adjournment, no further adjournment would be granted. There may be cases beyond the control of a H party despite the party having obtained three adjournments. For instance, a SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.] 961 party may be suddenly hospitalized on account of some serious ailment or A there may be serious accident or some act of God leading to devastation. It cannot be said that though circumstances may be beyond the control of a party, further adjournment cannot be granted because of restriction of three adjournments as provided in proviso to Order XVII Rule I. In some extreme cases, it may become necessary to grant adjournment B despite the fact that three adjournments have already been granted (Take the example of Bhopal Gas Tragedy, Gujarat earthquake and riots, devastation on account of Tsunami). Ultimately, it would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case, on the basis whereof the Court would decide to grant or refuse adjournment. The provision for costs and higher costs has C been made because of practice having been developed to award only a nominal cost even when adjournment on payment of costs is granted. Ordinarily, where the costs or higher costs are awarded, the same should be realistic and as far as possible actual cost that had to be incurred by the other party sh(\\!! be awarded where the adjournment is found to be avoidable but is being granted on account of either negligence or casual approach of a party or is D being sought to delay the progress of the case or on any such reason. Further, to save proviso to Order XVII Rule 1 from the vice of Article I 4 of the Constitution of India, it is necessary to read it down so as not to take away the discretion of the Court in the extreme hard cases noted above. The limitation of three adjournments would not apply where adjournment is to be E granted on account of circumstances which are beyond the control of a party. Even in cases which may not strictly come within the category of circumstances beyond the control of a party, the Court by resorting to the provision of higher cost which can also include punitive cost in the discretion of the Court, adjournment beyond three can be granted having regard to the injustice that may result on refusal thereof, with reference to peculiar facts of a case. F We may, however, add that grant of any adjournment let alone first, second or third adjournment is not a right of a party. The grant of adjournment by a court has to be on a party showing special and extraordinary circumstances. It cannot be in routine. While considering prayer for grant of adjournment, it is necessary to keep in mind the legislative intent to restrict grant of adjournments. G Order XVI/J Rule 2 Order XVIII Rule 2( 4) which was inserted by Act l 04 of 1976 has been omitted by Act 46 of 1999. Under the said Rule, the Court could direct or permit any party, to examine any party or any witness at any stage. The H 962 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. I S.C.R. A effect of deletion is the restoration of the status quo ante. This means that Jaw that was prevalent prior to 1976 amendment, would govern. The principles as noticed hereinbefore in regard to deletion of Order XVIII Rule l 7(a) would apply to the deletion of this provision as well. Even prior to insertion of Order XVIII Rule 2(4), such a permission could be granted by the Court B in its discretion. The provision was inserted in 1976 by way of caution. The omission of Order XVIII Rule 2(4) by 1999 amendment does not take away Court's inherent power to call for any witness at any stage either suo mo to or on the prayer of a party invoking the inherent powers of the Court. In Order XVIII Rule 2 sub-rules (3A) to 3(D) have been inserted by C Act 22 of 2002. The object of filing written arguments or fixing time limit of oral arguments is with a view to save time of court. The adherence to the requirement of these rules is likely to help in administering fair and speedy justice. Order VII Rule 14 D Order VII Rule 14 deals with production of documents which are the basis of the suit or the documents in plaintiffs possession or power. These documents are to be entered in the list of documents and produced in the Court with plaint. Order VII Rule 14(3) requires leave of Court to be obtained for production of the documents later. Order VII Rule 14( 4) reads as under: E \"Nothing in this rule shall apply to document produced for the cross examination of the plaintiffs witnesses, or, handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory.\" In the aforesaid Rule, it is evident that the words 'plaintiffs witnesses' have been mentioned as a result of mistake seems to have been committed F by the legislature. The words ought to be 'defendant's witnesses'. There is a similar provision in Order VIII Rule 1A(4) which applies to a defendant. It reads as under: \"Nothing in this rule shall apply to documents - G (a) produced for the cross-examination of the plaintiffs witnesses, or (b) handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory.\" Order VII relates to the production of documents by the plaintiff whereas H Order VIII relates to production of documents by the defendant. Under Order .. SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON:, TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.] 963 VIII Rule 1A(4) a document not produced by defendant can be confronted A to the plaintiff's witness during cross-examination. Similarly, the plaintiff can also confront the defendant's witness with a document during cross- examination. By mistake, instead of 'defendant's witnesses', the words 'plaintiff's witnesses' have been mentioned in Order VII Rule (4). To avoid any confusion, we direct that till the legislature corrects the mistake, the B words 'plaintiff's witnesses, would be read as 'defendant's witnesses' in Order VII Rule 4. We, however, hope that the mistake would be expeditiously corrected by the legislature. Costs Section 35 of the Code deals with the award of cost and Section 35A C with award of compensatory costs in respect of false or vexatious claims or defences. Section 95 deals with grant of compensation for obtaining arrest,. attachment or injunction on insufficient grounds. These three sections deal with three different aspects of award of cost and compensation. Under Section 95 cost can be awarded upto Rs.50,000 and under Section 35A, the costs D awardable are upto Rs.3,000. Section 35B provides for award of cost for causing delay where a party fails to take the step which he was required by or under the Code to take or obtains an adjournment for taking such step or for producing evidence or on any other ground. In circumstances mentioned in Section 35-B an order may be made requiring the defaulting party to pay to other party such costs as would, in the opinion of the court, be reasonably E sufficient to reimburse the other party in respect of the expenses incurred by him in attending the court on that date, and payment of such costs, on the date next following the date of such order, shall be a condition precedent to the further prosecution of the suit or the defence. Section 35 postulates that the cost shall follow the event and if not, reasons thereof shall be stated. The F award of the cost of the suit is in the discretion of the Court. In Sections 35 and 35B, there is no upper limit of amount of cost awardable. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that many unscrupulous parties take advantage of the fact that either the costs are not awarded or nominal costs are awarded on the unsuccessful party. Unfortunately, it has become a G practice to direct- parties to bear their own costs. In large number of cases, such an order is passed despite Section 35(2) of the Code. Such a practice also encourages filing of frivolous suits. It also leads to taking up of frivolous defences. Further wherever costs are awarded, ordinarily the same are not realistic.and are nominal. When Section 35(2) provides for cost to follow the H 964 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005) SUPP. I S.C.R. A event, it is implicit that the costs have to be those which are reasonably incurred by a successful party except in those cases where the Court in its discretion may direct otherwise by recording reasons thereof. The costs have to be actual reasonable costs including the cost of the time spent by the successful party, the transportation and lodging, if any, or any other incidental cost besides the payment of the court fee, lawyer's fee, typing and other cost B in relation to the litigation. It is for the High Courts to examine these aspects and wherever necessary make requisite rules, regulations or practice direction so as to provide appropriate guidelines for the subordinate courts to follow. c D Section 80 Section 80(1) of the Code requires prior notice of two months to be served on the Government as a condition for filing a suit except when there is urgency for interim order in which case the Court may not insist on the rigid rule of prior notice. The two months period has been provided for so that the Government shall examine the claim put up in the notice and has sufficient time to send a suitable reply. The underlying object is to curtail the litigation. The object also is to curtail the area of dispute and controversy. Similar provisions also exist in various other legislations as well. Wherever the statutory provision requires service of notice as a condition precedent for filing of suit and prescribed period therefore, it is not only necessary for the governments or departriients or other statutory bodies to send a reply to such E a notice but it is further necessary to properly deal with all material points and issues raised in the notice. The Governments, Government departments or statutory authorities are defendants in large number of suits pending in various courts in the country. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that in large number of cases either the notice is not replied or in few cases where F reply is sent, it is generally vague and evasive. The result is that the object underlying Section 80 of the Code and similar provisions gets defeated. It not only gives rise to avoidable litigation but also results in heavy expense and cost to the exchequer as well. Proper reply can result in reduction of litigation between State and the citizens. In case proper reply is sent either the claim in the notice may be admitted or area of controversy curtailed or the citizen G may be satisfied on knowing the stand of the State. There is no accountability in the Government, Central or State or the statutory authorities in violating ,,, , the spirit and object of Section 80. ,. , ,r , These provisions cast an implied duty on all concerned governments H and States and statutory authorities to send appropriate reply to such notices. SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.OJ. (SABHARWAL, J.] 965 Having regard to the existing state of affairs, we direct all concerned A governments, Central or State or other authorities, whenever any statute requires service of notice as a condition precedent for filing of suit or other proceedings against it, to nominate, within a period of three months, an officer who shall be made responsible to ensure that 'replies to notices under Section 80 or similar provisions are sent within the period stipulated in a particular legislation. The replies shall be. sent after due application of mind. B Despite such nomination, ifthe Court finds that either the notice has not been replied or reply is evasive and vague and has been sent without proper application of mind, the Court shall ordinarily award heavy cost against the Government and direct it to take ..• approprfate . actipn against the concerned Officer including recovery of costs from. him. C Section 115 of the Code vests power of revision in the High Court over courts subordinate to it. Proviso to Section 115(1) of the Code before the amendment by Act 46 of 1999 read as under : \"Provided that the High Court shall not, under this section vary or D reverse any order made, or may order deciding an issue, in the course of a suit or other proceeding except where - (a) the order, if it had been made in favour of the party applying for revision, would have finally disposed of the suit or other proceeding; or E (b) the order, if allowed to stand, would occasion a failure of justice or cause irreparable injury to the party against whom it was made.\" Now, the aforesaid proviso has been substituted· by the following proviso.: \"Provided that the High Court shall not, under this section, vary or reverse any order made, or any order deciding an issue, in the course F of a suit or other proceeding, except where the order, if it had been made in favour of the party applying for revision, would have finally G disposed of the. suit or other proceedings.\" The aforesaid clause (b) stands omitted. The question is about the ·constitutional powers of the High Courts under Article 227 on account of omission made in Section 115 of the Code. The question stands settled by a decision of this Court in Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai and Ors., H 966 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. I S.C.R. A [2003] 6 SCC 675 holding that the power of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution is always in addition to the revisional jurisdiction conferred on it. Curtailment of revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 115 of the Code does not take away and could not have taken away the constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court. The power exists, B untrammeled by the amendment in Section 115 and is ~vailable to be exercised subject to rules of self-discipline and practice which are as well settled. Section 148 The amendment made in Section 148 affects the power of the Court to C enlarge time that may have been fixed or granted by the Court for the doing of any act prescribed or allowed by the Code. The amendment provides that the period shall not exceed 30 days in total. Before amendment, there was no such restriction of time. Whether the Court has no inherent power to extend the time beyond 30 days is the question. We have no doubt that the upper limit fixed in Section 148 cannot take away the inherent power of the Court D to pass orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of process of Court. The rigid operation of the section would lead to absurdity. Section 151 has, therefore, to be allowed to fully operate. Extension beyond maximum of 30 days, thus, can be permitted if the act could not be performed within 30 days for the reasons beyond the control of the party. We are not dealing with a case where time for doing an act has been prescribed under E the provisions of the Limitation Act which cannot be extended either under Section 148 or Section 151. We are dealing with a case where the time is fixed or granted by the Court for performance ·of an act prescribed or allowed by the Court. F In Mahanth Ram Das v. Ganga Das, AIR (1961) SC 882, this Court considered a case where an order was passed by the Court that if the Court fee was not paid by a particular day, the suit shall stand dismissed. It was a self-operating order leading to dismissal of the suit. The party's application filed under Sections 148 and 151 of the Code for extension of time was dismissed. Allowing the appeal, it was observed: G H \"How undesirable it is to fix time peremptorily for a future happening which leaves the Court powerless to deal with events that might arise in between, it is not necessary to decide in this appeal. These orders tum out, often enough to be inexpedient. Such procedural orders, though peremptory (conditional decree apart), are, in essence, in terrorem, so that dilatory litigants might put themselves in order and ' .... .. SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.O.L [SABHARWAL, l] 967 avoid delay. They do not, however, completely estop a Court from A taking note of events and circumstances which happen within the time fixed. For example, it cannot be said that, if the appellant had started with the full money ordered to be paid and came well in time, but was set upon and robbed by thieves the day previous, he could not ask for extension of time or that the Court was powerless to B extend It. Such orders are not like the law of the Medes and the Persians.\" There can be many cases where non-grant of extension beyond 30 days would amount to failure of justice. The object of the Code is not to promote failure of justice. Section 148, therefore, deserves to be read down to mean C that where sufficient cause exists or events are beyond the control of a party, the Court would have inherent power to extend time beyond 30 days. Order IX Rule 5 The period of seven days mentioned in Order IX Rule 5 is clearly D directory. Order XI Rule 15 The stipulation in Rule 15 of Order XI confining the inspection of documents 'at or before the settlement of issues' instead of 'at any time' is E also nothing but directory. It does not mean that the inspection cannot be allowed after the settlement of issues. Judicial Impact Assessment The Committee has taken note of para 7 .8.2 of Volume I of the Report F of the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution which reads as follows : \"7.8.2 Government of India should not throw the entire burden of establishing the subordinate courts and maintaining the subordinate judiciary on the State Governments. There is a concurrent obligation G on the Union Government to meet the expenditure for subordinate courts. Therefore, the Planning Commission and the Finance Commission must allocate sufficient funds from national resources to meet the demands of the State Judiciary in each of the States.\" H 968 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. 1 S.C.R. A The Committee has further noticed that : B c D \"33.3. As pointed out by the Constitution Review Commission, the Jaws which are being administered by the Courts which are subordinate to the High Court are Jaws which h&.ve been made by, (a) parliament on subjects which fall under the Entries in List I and List III of Schedule 7 to the Constitution, or (b) State legislatures on subjects which fall under the Entries in List II and List III of Schedule 7 to the Constitution. But, the bulk of the cases (civil, criminal) in the subordinate Courts concern the Law of Contract, Transfer of Property Act, Sale of Goods Act, Negotiable Instruments Act, Indian Penal Code, Code of Civil Procedure, Code of Criminal Procedure etc., which are all Central Laws made under List III. In addition, the subordinate Courts adjudicate cases (in civil, criminal) arising under Central Laws made under List I. 33.4. The central Government has, therefore, to bear a substantial portion of the expenditure on subordinate Courts which are now being established/maintained by the States. (The Central Government has only recently given monies for the fast track courts but these courts E are a small fraction of the required number). F G H 33.5. Under Article 247, Central Government could establish Courts for the purpose of administering Central Laws in List I. Except a few Tribunals, no such Courts have been established commensurate with the number of cases arising out of subjects in List I.\" The Committee has suggested that the Central Government has to provide substantial funds for establishing courts which are subordinate to the High Court and the Planning Commission and the Finance must make adequate provisions therefore, noticing that it has been so recommended by the Constitution Review Committee. The Committee has also suggested that : \"Further, there must be 'judicial impact assessment', as done in the United States, whenever any legislation is introduced either in Parliament or in the State Legislatures. The financial memorandum attached to each Bill must estimate not only the budgetary requirement -('' .. SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. (SABHARWAL, J] 969 of other staff but also the budgetary requirement for meeting the A expenses of the additional cases that may arise out of the new Bill when it is passed by the legislature. The said budget must mention the number of civil and criminal cases likely to be generated by the new Act, how many Courts are necessary, how many Judges and staff are necessary and what is the infrastructure necessary. So far in the B last fifty years such a judicial impact assessment has never been made by any legislature or by Parliament in our country.\" Having regard to the constitutional obligation to provide fair, quick and speedy justi1;:e, we direct .the Central Government to examine the aforesaid suggestions 'and submit a report on this Court within four months. Report No.2 We will now take up Report No.2 dealing with model Alternative Dispute Resolution and Mediation Rules. c Part X of the Code (Sections 121 to 131) contains provisions in respect D of the Rules. Sections 122 and 125 enable the High Courts to make Rules. Section 128 deals with matters for which rules may provide. It, inter alia, states that the rules which are not inconsistent with the provisions in the body of the Code, but, subject thereto, may provide for any matters relating to the procedure of Civil Courts.

BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. UO.I. [SABHARWAL, J.] 971 Some doubt as to a possible conflict has been expressed in view of use A of the word 'may' in Section 89 when it stipulates that 'the Court may reformulate the terms of a possible settlement and refer the same for' and use of the word 'shall' in Order X, Rule IA when it states that 'the Court shall direct the parties to the suit to opt either mode of settlements outside the Court as specified in sub-section (I) of Section 89'. As can be seen from Section 89, its first part uses the word 'shall' when it stipulates that the 'court shall formulate terms of settlement'. The use of B the word 'may' in later part of Section 89 only relates to the aspect of reformulating the terms of a possible settlement. The intention of the legislature behind enacting. Section 89 is that where it appears to the Court that there C exists element 0f a settlement which may be acceptable to the parties, they, at .the instance of the court, shall be made to apply their mind so as to opt for one or the other of the four ADR methods mentioned in the Section and if the parties do not agree, the court shall refer them to one or other of the said modes. Section 89 uses both the word 'shall' and 'may' whereas Order X, Rule IA uses the word 'shall' but on harmonious reading of these provisions D it becomes clear that the use of the word 'may' in Section 89 only governs the aspect of reformulation of the terms of a possible settlement and its reference to one of ADR methods. There is no conflict. It is evident that what is referred to one of the ADR modes is the dispute which is summarized in the terms of settlement formulated or reformulated in terms of Section 89. One of the modes to which the dispute can be referred is 'Arbitration'. Section 89 (2) provides that where a dispute has been referred for Arbitration or Conciliation, the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 E (for short '1996 Act') shall apply as if the proceedings for Arbitration or Conciliation were referred for settlement under the provisions of 1996 Act. p Section 8 of the 1996 Act deals with the power to refer parties to Arbitration where there is arbitration agreement. As held in P. Anand Gajapathi Raju and Ors. v. P. V.G.Raju (Dead) and Ors., [2000] 4 SCC 539, 1996 Act governs a case where arbitration is agreed upon before or pending a suit by all the parties. The 1996 Act, however, does not contemplate a situation as in Section 89 of the Code where the Court asks the parties to choose one or other AD Rs G including Arbitration and the parties choose Arbitration as their option. Of course, the parties have to agree for Arbitration. Section 82 of 1996 Act enables the High Court to make Rules consistent with this Act as to all proceedings before the Court under 1996 Act. Section 84 enables the Central Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. The H 972 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005) SUPP. I S.C.R. A procedure for option to Arbitration among four ADRs is not contemplated by the 1996 Act and, therefore, Section 82 or 84 has no applicability where parties agree to go for arbitration under Section 89 of the Code. As already noticed, for the purposes of Section 89 and Order X, Rule IA, lB and IC, the relevant Sections in Part X of the Code enable the High Court to frame rules. If reference is made to Arbitration under Section 89 of the Code, 1996 B Act would apply only from the stage after reference and not before the stage of reference when options under Section 89 are given by the Court and chosen by the parties. On the same analogy, 1996 Act in relation to Conciliation would apply only after the stage of reference to Conciliation. The 1996 Act does not deal with a situation where after suit is filed, the court requites _a-'' C party to choose one or other ADRs inciuding -Concili~tion.' Thus, for Conciliation also rules can be made under Part X of the Code for purposes of procedure for opting for 'Conciliation' and upto the stage of reference to Conciliation. Thus, there is no impediment in the ADR rules being framed in relation to Civil Court as contemplated in Section 89 upto the stage ofreference to ADR. The 1996 Act comes into play only after the stage of reference upto D the award. Applying the same analogy, the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 (for short '1987 Act') or the Rules framed thereunder by the State Governments cannot act as impediment in the High Court making rules under Part X of the Code covering the manner in which option to Lok Adalat can be made being one of the modes provided in Section 89. The I 987 Act also E does not deal with the aspect of exercising option to one of four ADR methods mentioned in Section 89. Section 89 makes applicable I 996 Act and I 987 Act from the stage after exercise of options and making ofreference. A doubt has been expressed in relation to clause ( d) of Section 89 (2) of the Code on the question as to finalisation of the terms of the compromise. F The question is whether the terms of compromise are to be finalised by or before the mediator or by or before the court. It is evident that all the four alternatives, namely, Arbitration, Conciliation, judicial settlement including settlement through Lok Adalat and mediation are meant to be the action of persons or institutions outside the Court and not before the Court. Order X, Rule IC speaks of the 'Conciliation forum' referring back the dispute to the G Court. In fact, the court is not involved in the actual mediation/conciliation. Clause (d) of Section 89(2) only means that when mediation succeeds and parties agree to the terms of settlement, the mediator will report to the court and the court, after giving notice and hearing the parties, 'effect' the compromise and pass a decree in accordance with the terms of settlement H accepted by the parties. Further, in this view, there is no question of the 'I SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.l. [SABHARWAL, J.] 973 Court which refers the matter to mediation/conciliation being debarred from A hearing the matter where settlement is not arrived at. The Judge who makes the reference only considers the limited question as to whether there are reasonable grounds to expect that there will be settlement and on that ground he cannot be treated to be disqualified to try the suit afterwards if no settlement is arrived at between the parties. B The question also is about the payment made and expenses to be incurred where the court compulsorily refers a matter for conciliation/mediation. Considering large number of responses received by the Committee to the draft rules it has suggested that in the event of such compulsory reference to conciliation/mediation procedures if expenditure on conciliation/mediation is C borne by the government, it may encourage parties to come forward and make attempts at conciliation/mediation. On the other hand, if the parties feel that they have to incur extra expenditure for resorting to such ADR modes, it is likely to act as a deterrent for adopting these methods. The suggestion is laudable. the Central Government is directed to examine it and if agreed, it shall request the Planning Commission and Finance Commission to make D specific financial allocation for the judiciary for including the expenses involved for mediation/conciliation under Section 89 of the Code. In case, Central Government has any reservations, the same shall be placed before the court within four months. In such event, the government shall consider provisionally releasing adequate funds for these purposes also having regard E ·to what we have earlier noticed about many statutes that are being administered and litigations pending in the Courts in various States are central legislations concerning the subjects in List I and List III of Schedule VII to the Constitution of India. With a view to enable the Court to refer the parties to conciliation/ p mediation, where parties are unable to reach a consensus on an agreed name, there should be a panel of well trained conciliators/mediators to which it may be possible for the Court to make a reference. It would be necessary for the High Courts and district courts to take appropriate steps in the direction of preparing the requisite panels. A doubt was expressed about the applicability of ADR rules for dispute arising under the Family Courts Act since that Act also contemplates rules to be made. It is, however, to be borne in mind that the Family Courts Act applies the Code for all proceedings before it. In this view, ADR rules made under the Code can be applied to supplement the rules made under the Family G H 974 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. I S.C.R. A Courts Act and provide for ADR insofar as conciliation/mediation is concerned. It seems clear from the report that while drafting the model rules, afa~r examining the mediation rules in various countries, a fine distinction is tried to be maintained between conciliation and mediation, accepting the views expressed by British author Mr. Brown in his work on India that in B 'conciliation' there is little more latitude and conciliator can suggest some tenns of settlements too. When the parties come to a settlement upon a reference made by the Court for mediation, as suggested by the Committee that there has to be some C public record of the manner in which the suit is disposed of and, therefore, the Court has to first record the settlement and pass a decree in terms thereof and if necessary proceed to execute it in accordance with law. It cannot be accepted that such a procedure would be unnecessary. If the settlement is not filed in the Court for the purpose of passing of a decree, there will be no public record of the settlement. It is, however, a differentmatter if the parties D do not want the court to record a settlement and pass a decree and feel that the settlement can be implemented even without decree. In such eventuality, nothing prevents them in informing the Court that the suit may be dismissed as a dispute has been settled between the parties outside the Court. Regarding refund of the court fee where the matter is settled by the E reference to one of the modes provided in Section 89 of the Act, it is for the State Governments to amend the laws on the lines of amendment made in Central Court Fee Act by 1999 Amendment to the Code. The State Governments can consider making similar amendments in the State Court Fee legislations. F The draft rules have been finalised by the Committee. Prior to finalisation, the same were circulated to the High Courts, subordinate courts, the Bar Council of India, State Bar Councils and the Bar Associations, seeking their responses. Now, it is for the respective High Courts to take appropriate steps for making rules in exercise of rule making power subject to G modifications, if any, which may be considered relevant.

(ii) if the issues are not servable, the Court shall wait for a decision of the Court on the other issues which are not settled.

The case management policy can yield remarkable results in achieving more disposal of the cases. Its mandate is for the Judge or an officer of the court to set a time-table and monitor a case from its initiation to its disposal. The H Committee on survey of the progress made in other countries has come to a SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.) 995 conclusion that the case management system has yielded exceedingly good A results. Model Case Flow Management Rules have been separately dealt with for trial courts and first appellate subordinate courts and for .High Courts. These draft Rules extensively deal with the various stages of the litigation. The High Courts can examine these Rules, discuss the matter and consider B the question of adopting or making case law management and model rules with or without modification, so that a step forward is taken to provide to the litigating public a fair, speedy and inexpensive justice.

High Court Act, ...... and all other SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.O.L [SABHARWAL, J.] 997 powers enabling the ........ High Court hereby makes the following Rules, A in regard fo case flow management in the subordinate courts. (A) Model Rules for Trial Courts and First Appellate Subordinate Courts I. Division of Civil Suits and Appeals into Tracks 1. Based on the nature of dispute, the quantum of evidence to be recorded and the time likely to be taken for the completion of suit, B the suits shall be channeled into different tracks. Track I may include suits for maintenance, divorce and child custody and visitation rights, grant of letters of administration and succession certificate and simple C suits for rent or for eviction (upon notice under Section 106 of Transfer · of Property Act). Track 2 may consist of money suits and suits based solely on negotiable instruments. Track 3 may include suits concerning partition and like property disputes, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property matters. Track 4 may relate to other matters. All efforts shall be taken to complete the suits in track I within a period D of 9 months, track 2 within 12 months and suits in track 3 and 4 within 24 months. This categorization is illustrative and it will be for the High Court to make appropriate categorization. It will be for the judge concerned to make an appropriate assessment as to which track any case can be E assigned. 2. Once in a month, the registry/administrative staff of each Court will prepare a report as to the stage and progress of cases which are proposed to be listed in next month and place the report before the Court. When the matters are listed on each day, the judge concerned F may take such decision as he may deem fit in the presence of counsel/ parties in regard to each case for removing any obstacles in service of summons, completion of pleadings etc. with a view to make the case ready for disposal. 3. The judge referred to in clause (2) above, may shift a case from G one track to another, depending upon the complexity and other circumstances of the case. 4. Where computerization is available, the monthly data will be fed into the computer in such a manner that the judge referred to in H 998 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. I S.C.R. A clause (2) above, will be able to ascertain the position and the stage B c D E F G H of every case in every track from the computer screen. Over a period, . all cases pending in his Court will be covered. Where computerization is not available, the monitoring must be done manually. 5. The judge referred to in clause (2) above, shall monitor and control the flow or progress of every case, either from the computer or from the register or data placed before him in the above manner or in some other manner he may innovate. II. Original Suit : 1. Fixation of time limits while issuing notice : (a) Wherever notice is issued in a suit, the notice should indicate that the Code prescribes a maximum of 30 days for filing written statement (which for special reasons may be extended upto 90 days) and, therefore, the defendants may prepare the written statement expeditiously and that the matter will be listed for that purpose on the expiry of eight weeks from the date of issue of notice (so that it can be a definite date). After the written statement is filed, the replication (if any, proposed and permitted), should be filed within six weeks of receipt of the written statement. If there are more than one defendant, each one of the defendant should comply with this requirement within the time-limit. (b) The notice referred to in clause (a) shall be accompanied by a complete copy of the plaint and all its annexure/enclosures and copies of the interlocutory applications, if any. (c) If interlocutory applications are filed along with the plaint, and if an ex-parte interim order is not passed and the Court is desirous of hearing the respondent, it may, while sending the notice along with the plaint, fix an earlier date for the hearing of the application (than the date for filing written statement) depending upon the urgency for interim relief. 2. Service of Summons/notice and completion of pleadings : (a) Summons may be served as indicated in clause (3) of Rule 9 of Order V. SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.) 999 , ...... (b) In the case of service of summons by the plaintiff or a courier A where a return is filed that the defendant has refused notice, the return will be accompanied by an undertaking that the plaintiff or the courier, as the case may be, is aware that if the return is found to be false, he can be punished for perjury or summarily dealt with for contempt of Court for abuse of B the provisions of the Code. Where the plaintiff comes forward with a return of 'refusal', the provisjons of Order 9A Rule (4) will be follow~ by re-issue of summons through Court. (c) If it has not been possible to effect service of summons under Rule 9 of Order V; the provisions of Rule 17 of Order c V shall apply and the plaintiff shall within 7 days from the date of its inability to serve the summons, to request the Court to iJermit substituted service. The dates for filing the written statement and replication, if any, shall accordingly stand extended. 3. Calling of Cases (Hajri or Call Work or Roll Call) : D The present practice of the Court-master or Bench.~clerk calling all the cases listed on a particular day at the beginning of the day in order to confirm whether counsel are ready, whether parties are present or whether various steps in the suit or proceeding has been taken, is E consuming a lot of time of the Court, sometimes almost two hours of the best part of the day when the judge is fresh. After such work, the Court is left with very limited time to deal with cases listed before it. Formal listing should be first before a nominated senior officer of the registry, one or two days before the listing in Court. He may give dates in routine matters for compliance with earlier orders of Court. F Cases will be listed before Court only where an order of the Court is necessary or where an order prescribing the consequences of default or where a peremptory order or an order as to costs is required to be passed on the judicial side. Cases which have to be adjourned as a matter of routine for taking steps in the suit or proceeding should not G be unnecessarily listed before Court. Where parties/counsel are not attending before the Court•officer or are defiant or negligent, their cases may be placed before the Court. Listing of cases on any day before a Court should be based on a reasonable estimate of time and number of cases that can be disposed of by the Court in a particular -;.. day. The Courts shall, therefore, dispense with the practice of calling H 1000 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. 1 S.C.R. A all the cases listed adjourned to any particular day. Cases will be first listed before a nominated senior officer of the Court, nominated for the purpose. 4. Procedure on the grant of interim orders: B (a) If an interim mder is granted at the first hearing by the Court, the defendants would have the option of moving appropriate applications for vacating the interim order even before the returnable date indicated in the notice and if such an application is filed, it shall be listed as soon as possible even before the returnable date. c (b) If the Court passes an ad-interim ex-parte order in an interlocutory application, ~nd the reply by the defendants is filed, and if, thereafter, the plaintiff fails to file the rejoinder (if any) without good reason for the delay, the Court has to consider whether the stay or interim order passed by the D Court should be vacated and shall list the case with that purpose. This is meant to prevent parties taking adjournment with a view to have undue benefit of the ad interim orders. The plaintiff may, if he so chooses, also waive his right to file a rejoinder. A communication of option by the plaintiff E not to file a rejoinder, made to the registry will be deemed to be the completion of pleadings in the interlocutory application. 5. Referral to Alternate Dispute Resolution: (In the hearing before the Court, after completion of pleadings, F time limit for discovery and inspection, and admission and denials, of documents shall be fixed, preferably restricted to 4 weeks each) After the completion of admission and denial of documents by the parties, the suit shall {>e listed before the Court (for examination of parties under Order X of the Civil Procedure Code. A joint statement G of admitted facts shall be filed before the said date.) The Court shall thereafter, follow the procedure prescribed under the Alternative Dispute Resolution and Mediation Rules, 2002. 6. Procedure on the failure of Alternate Dispute Resolution : H On the filing of report by the Mediator under the Mediation Rules . ..... ' SALEM ADV BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.] 100} that efforts at Mediation have failed, or a report by the Conciliator A under the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, or a report of no settlement in the Lok Adalat under the provisions of the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 the suit shall be listed before the registry within a period of 14 days. At the said hearing before the registry, all the parties shall submit the draft issues proposed by them. B The suit shall be listed before the Court within 14 days thereafter for framing of issues. When the. suit is listed after failure of the attempts at conciliation, arbitration or Lok Adalat, the Judge may merely inquire whether it is still possible for the parties to resolve the dispute. This should C invariably be done by the Judge at the first hearing when the matter comes back on failure of conciliation, mediation or Lok Adalat. If the parties are not keen about settlement, the Court shall frame the issues and direct the plaintiff to start examining his witnesses. The procedure of each witness filing his examination-in-chief and D being examined in cross or re-examination will continue, one after the other. After completion of evidence on the plaintiff's side, the defendants shall lead evidence likewise, witness after witness, the chief examination of each witness being by affidavit and the witness being then cross-examined or re-examined. The parties shall keep he affidavit in chief-examination ready whenever the witness's E examination is taken up. As far as possible, evidence must be taken up day by day as stated in clause (a) of proviso to Rule 2 of Order XVII. The parties shall also indicate the likely duration for the evidence to be completed, and for the arguments to be thereafter heard. The Judge shall ascertain the availability of time of the Court and will list F the matter for trial on a date when the trial can go on from day to day and conclude the evidence. The possibility of further negotiation and settlement should be kept open and if such a settlement takes place, it should be open to the parties to move the registry for getting the matter listed at an earlier date for disposal. 7. Referral to Commissioner for recordal of evidence : (a) The High Court shall conduct an examination on the subjects of the Code of Civil Procedure and Evidence Act. Only those advocates who have passed an examination conducted G by the High Court on the subjects of 'Code of Civil H A B c D E F G H 1002 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2005] SUPP. l S.C.R. Procedure' and Evidence Act, - shall be appointed as Commissioners for recording evidence. They shall be ranked according to the marks secured by them. (b) It is not necessary that in every case the Court should appoint a Commissioner for recording evidence. Only ifthe recording of evidence is likely to take a long time, or there are any other special grounds, should the Court consider appointing a Commissioner for recording the. e¥idence. The Court should direct that the matter be listed for arguments fifteen days after the Commissioner files his report with the evidence .. · The Court may initially fix a spe.cific period. for the· completion of the recording of the evidence by the Commissioner and direct the matter to be listed on the date of expiry of the period, so that Court may know whether the parties are CO\"Operating with the Commissioner and whether the recording of evidence is getting unnecessarily prolonged. (c) Commissioners should file an undertaking in Court upon their appointment that they will keep the records handed over to them and those that may be filed before them, safe and shall not allow any party to inspect them in the absence of the opposite party/counsel. If there is delay of more than one month in the dates fixed for recording evidence, it is advisable for them to return the file to the Court and take it back on the eve of the adjourned date. 8. Costs : So far as awarding of costs at the time of judgment is concerned, awarding of costs must be treated generally as mandatory in as much as the liberal attitude of the Courts in directing the parties to bear their own costs had led parties to file a number of frivolous cases in the Courts or to raise frivolous and unnecessary issues. Costs should invariably follow the event. Where a party succeeds ultimately on one is.sue or point but loses on number of other issues or points which were unnecessarily raised, costs must be appropriately apportioned. Special reasons must be assigned if costs are not being awarded. Costs should be assessed according to rules in force. If any of the parties has unreasonably protracted the proceedings, the Judge should SALEM ADV. BAR ASSON., TAMIL NADU v. U.0.1. [SABHARWAL, J.] } 003 consider exercising discretion to impose exemplary costs after taking A into account the expense incurred for the purpose of attendance on the adjourned dates. 9. Proceedings for Perjury : If the Trial Judge, while delivering the judgment, is of the view B that any of the parties or witnesses have wilfully and deliberately uttered blatant falsehoods, he shall consider (at least in some grave cases) whether it is a fit case where prosecution should be initiated for perjury and order prosecution accordingly. 10. Adjournments : . The amendments to the Code have restricted the number of adjournments to threein the course of hearing of the suit, on reasonable cause being shown. When a suit is listed before a Court and any party seeks adjournment, the Court shall have to verify whether the party c is seeking adjournment due to circumstances beyond the control of D the party, as required by clause (b) of proviso to Rule 2 of Order XVII. The Court shall impose costs as specified in Rule 2 of Order XVII. ' 11. Miscellaneous Applications : ,... . The proceedings in a suit shall not be stayed merely because of E the filing of Miscellaneous Application in the course of suit unless the Court in its discretfoii expressly thinks it necessary to stay the proceedings in the suit III. First Appeals to Subordinate Courts 1. Service of Notice of Appeal: First Appeals being appeals on question of fact and law, Courts are generally inclined to admit the appeal and it is only in exceptional cases that the appeal is rejected at the admission stage under Rule 11 F of Order XLI. In view of the amended CPC, a copy of the G memorandum of appeal is required to be filed in the subordinate Court. It has been clarified by the Supreme Court that the requirement of filing a copy of appeal memorandum in the sub-ordinate Court does not mean that appeal memorandum cannot be filed in the Appellate Court immediately for obtaining interim orders.

[SABHARWAL, J.) 1005 fails to file the rejoinder, Court shall consider whether it is a fit case A for vacating the stay or interim order and list the case for that purpose. This is intended to see that those who have obtained ad interim orders do not procrastinate in filing replies. The appellant may also waive his right to file the rejoinder. Such choice shall be conveyed to the registry on or before the date fixed for filing of rejoinder. Such B communication of option by the applicant to the registry will be deemed to be completion of pleadings. 6.

In view of the amended CPC, a copy of the appeal is required to be filed in the Trial Court. It has been clarified by the Supreme Court that the requirement of filing of appeal in the Trial Court does not mean that the party cannot file the appeal in the F appellate Court (High Court) immediately for obtaining interim orders. In addition to the process for normal service as per the Code of Civil Procedure, advance notice should simultaneously be given by the counsel. for the party who is proposing to file the appeal, to the counsel for the opposite party in the Trial Court itself so as to enable G them to inform the parties to appear if they so choose even at the first hearing stage. 2.

D Appeals against interlocutory orders falling under category (I) E above should be invariably filed after advance notice to the opposite counsel (who has appeared before the Single Judge) so that both the sides will be represented at the very first hearing of the appeals. If both. parties appear at the first hearing, there is no need to serve the opposite side by normal process and at least in some cases, the appeals against interlocutory orders can be disposed of even at the first hearing. F If, for any reason, this is not practicable, such appeals against interim orders should be disposed of within a period of a month. In cases referred to above, necessary documents should be kept ready by the counsel to enable the Court to dispose of the appeal against interlocutory matter at the first hearing itself. G In ~II Appeals against interim orders in the High Court, in writs and civil. matters, the Court should endeavour to set down and observe a strict time limit in regard to oral arguments.

'The notice ~. - should require the respondents to file their written submissions ' within a period of eight weeks from service of notice. Efforts should be made to complete the hearing of the Second Appeals within a period of six months. VII.
