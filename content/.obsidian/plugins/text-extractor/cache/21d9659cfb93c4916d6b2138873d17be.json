D ln this writ petition the construction of the W'Ords 'public premisea' in the Public Premises (Evi~tion of Unathorised Occupants) Act, 1971 ,vas necessary. It was contended by the peti ioner that- (i) Since the Act of 1971 was enacted under Entry 32 Li~t I ot the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution the expression ·property of E the Union' cannot iniclude the property of a statutory Corporation, even though it may be entirely financed by the Central Government. The Act cannot apply to the property of a statutory Corporation an·d, therefore, the defin,ition of the words 'public premises' in so far aa it purports to include the premises belongin,g to the statutory Corpo- ration is unconstitutional. F G (ii) The definition' of 'public premises' in section 2(e) of the Act, has two parts and wily the second part applies to Un.ion Territory of Delhi and since it does not include premises which belong to a :;tatutory Corporation, the said Act does not apply to the prnsent pro- mises which are situated in· the Union Territory of Delhi. (iii) The 1elationship between the petitioner and respondent No. 1 is that of tenant and landlord. The Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, is a complete Code dealing with the eviction of a tenant by a landlord. In section 3, an exception is made in favcur of the premises ·oelonging to the Go,,1ernment but not in favour of the premises belongin·g to a H statutory Corporation.

The definition of 'public premises' in section 2(e), though in two parts, is one continuous definjtion. They have to be read cumulatively. They are connected by the word 'and' and not by the word 'or'. The only reason why sub-section (2) has been inserted is to add to the defin,ition of sub-section' _(1) something which would apply only in the Union Territory of Delhi because of its many public buildings concent- rated in the capital and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Delhi Development Authority are included in the definition of owners of public premises. This is a special reason why sub-section (2) has been' added in respect of the Union Territory of Delhi alone. Fur- ther, sub~section (1) also applies to the Union Territory of Delhi. Delhi i.; a part of India. What applies to In,dia also appli~s to Delhi in respect of Central legislation. Therefore, the definition 'public pre- mises' includes th1 · premises of respondent No. 1. (Para 5). 3. With reference to the two Acts-the Delhi Rent' Control Act, 1958, an.d the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act 1971-the position is quite clear. On the one hand, the relation- ship of landlord and tenant in respect of premises except G:wcrnment premises can, be the subject matter of litigation under the Delhi Rent Control Act whereas, the eviction of unauthorised occupants from public premises can be the subject of appropri.a,te proc~edings under '11e Public P.remiscs (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act 1971, an'd the owners of public premises can, evict an unauthorised occupant expeditiously and the right of appeal is also limited from the order of the Estate Officer to the District Judge only. h is well settled that the Government and public authorities stand in a special class anJ a special procedure can be provided for evicting unauthorised persons from properties belonging to them. (Maganlal Chhagganlal (P) Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay, AIR 1974 SC 2009 referred to). 4. As regards the qrn~sti0n of infringement of the exclusive 1ur1s- diction, of the Controller under the Delhi Rent Control Act, by the Estate Officer acting under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unautho- rised Occupants) Act 1971 , the principles of harmonisation laid down in Shri Ram Narain v. 1Pc s:mla Bankin,~ & Industrial Co.

In the present case, the objects and polici~s of the two statutes are quite different from each other. The Delhi Rent Control Act main- tains the distinction be wecn public premises and other premises which is the basis of the Public Prcmis~ (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971. Section 3 exclud·cs government premises from the pur- view of the Delhi Rent Control Act. All that has happened is that the definition of public premises under the Public Jll.remises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act is wider than the definition of_ government premises under the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958.

Shri V. S. Desai, learned counsel for the petitioner has urged tac following contentions as to the construction of this definition of \"public premises.\" ( 1) The Act is apparently enacted in exercise of the power of Parliament given by Entry 32 List 1 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which is as fol!ow~ :- \"Property of the Union and the revenue thercfrom, but as regards property situated in a State subject to legisla- tion by the State, save in so far as Parliament by law otherwise provide.\" The expression \"property of the Union•• cannot include the property of a statutory Corporation, like respondent No. 1, even though it may be entirely financed by the Central Government. The Act cannot thus ap~ly to th~ property of a statutory Corporation and for t.hat reason the definition of \"public premises\" in so far as it purports in section 2(2) (1) (ii) to include the premises belonging to a statutory Corporation established. by or under a Central Act and under or controlled by the Central Government is un- constitutional. (2) The definition of \"public premises'' has two parts. sub- section (1) and sub-section (2) . It is submitted that only the second part of the definition in sub-section (2) applies to the Union Territory of Delhi and s'ince it does not include premises wh•ch belong to a statutory Corporation like respondent No. 1 the said Act does not apply to the present premises which are -.ituated irr the Union Territory of Delhi.

These contentions have been traversed in the counter-affidavit where reference is also made to the merits of the case as to whether the tenant-petitioner has or has not contravened the terms o~ the lease and the prohibition contained in the lease of the land held by respondent No. 1 from the lessor.

They are connected by the word \"and\" and not by the word \"or\". The only reason why sub-section (2) has been inserted is to add to the definition of sub- section (I) something which would apply only in the Union Territory of Del11i. The reason is obvious. The Central Government and the Delhi Development Authority in Delhi own and p,)sscss so many public premises as are not possessed by the Government or ihc Gov- ernment Corporations or statutory authorities in any other place 0f comparable area. It is because of the tremendous concentration of C public premises in Delhi that the Municipal Corporation and the Delhi Development Authority were included in the definitioa of owners of public premises. This being a special reason it i-s quite understand- able why sub-section (2) has been added in respect of the Union Territory of Delhi alone. This does not mean, hcwever, that sub- section ( 1) does not apply to the Union Territory of Delhi. Delhi is a pa.rt of India. What applies to India also applies to Delhi in respect of Central legislation. We are not, therefore, persuaded to agree with the learned counsel that sub-section (1) of secfr:m 2(e) of the Act does not apply to Delhi- Since it applies anu claus~ (ii) E of sub-section (1) of section 2 ( e) includes the premises belonging to a statutory Corporation established by or under a Central Act and owned and controlled by the Central Government and since 1·csp.on- dent No. 1 is such a Corporation the dcfinitic;n includes the premises F of respondent No. 1, which were let out to the petitioner.

On the G one hand, we have the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, which is a successcr to previous enactments and orders, the ob.iect of which is to protect tenants from arbitrary evictions and ,11so to control the amount of rent payable by the tenant. On the other hand, we have the public premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971, H which retrospectively succeeds ,the Public Premises (Eviction of Un- authorised Occupants) Act, 1958, the object of which is to distinguish public premises from other premises and to enable the owners of public premises to evict unauthorised occupants therefrom by an expe- l ditious procedure and also to limit the right of appeal from the order of the Estate Officer only to the District Judge. It is well settled by a catena of cases culminating with Maganlal Chhagganlal (P) Ltd. v.

THE LIFE INSURANCE 335 CORPORATION AND ANOTHER A persons from properties belonging to them Indeed, it was not argued and could not be argued before the seven-I udge Bench in that case that the classification of public premises as different from other pre- mises can be objected to at all on any constitutlon::tl or legal ground. What was objected to in that case was that two alternative procedures B should net be made available to the owners of public premises with- out adequate guidelines to show which of the alternative remedte:5 should be adopted in which circumstances. It was held in that case that such guidelines were clearly spelt out fr'.)m the preamble and C the provisions of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised OC{:upants) Act and, therefore, irrespective of the fact that section 15 of the said Act excludes resort to civil -::ourts for the purpose of ob- taining eviction of unauthorised occupants, the said Act was not un- D E G H constitutional as being contrary to Article 14 of the Constitution. 7. The situation before us appears to be as follows : On the one hand, the relationship of landlord and tenant in respect of pre- mises except Government premises can be the ~ub_jcct matter of litiga- tion under the Delhi Rent Control Act. On the other hand, the evic- tion of unauthorised occupants from rublic premises can be the subject of appropriate proceedings under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, l 971. To us, the question is 110t as to which Act prevails over the other or takes away the jurisdiction from tht· other. On the other hand, we would follow the principles of harmonisation Iaid down by the Supreme Court in Shri Ram Narain v. The Simla Ban~dng and Industrial Co. Ltd. ( 1956) SCR 603 (2). In that case also, where the two statutes concerned were equally appli- cable to th·~ facts of the case, the Supreme Ccurt cleared its way by stating at page 615 of the report as follows : ''It is, therefore, desirable to determ'ine the overriding effect of one or the other of the relevant provisions in these two Acts, in a given case, on much broader considerations of the purpose and policy underlying the two Acts and the clear intendment conveyed by the language of the relevant. provisions therein.\" 8. By the words \"overriding effect\" is not to be understood an implied repeal. All that we are concerned with is this : Each of these 1 two statutes is available fm the initiating such proceedings as is most appropriate to the particular cause of action. For, for instance, the tenant ljas his own cause of action and he makes an application under a provision of the Delhi Rent Control Act, such as fixation of standard rent, then the Controller will have jurisdiction under the said Act, if section 3 does not exclude the premises from the purview of the Act. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: ILR (Delhi), © 2024 Delhi High Court.

Ltd.~cccc® ION LINE;:: True Print™ 336 INDIAN LAW REPORTS (DELHI) ILR (1980) I Delhi A It would be no defence for the landlord to urge in such a proceeding before the Controller that the jurisdiction of the Controller is taken away by sc)me other act like the Public Premic;e;, (E\\'ktion of Unautho- rh;ed Occupants) Act, 1971, in which the definition o( \"rent'' is different B from the definition of rent in the Delhi Rent Control Act and the provisions 1egarding :fixation of standard rent arc absent. The Nason is simple. The Controller is exercising jurisdiction under the DeU'li Rent Control Act. It can n-ever be argued that the jurisdiction given by that statute is taken away by some other statute which does not have the C same ol~jcct in view and which cannot furnish 3 defence in a pro- ceeding which is under a different statute. Similarly, if the cause of action for eviction of a tenant arises in favour of the landlord who is the owner of a public premises within the meaning of section 2 ( e) of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupant~) Act. then D the approfriate proceedings can be initiated by such a landlord before in E~tate Officer or rather an Estate Officer can take proceedings in respect of sueh public premises. By the same parity of reasoning, as given above. the tenant cannot plead before the Estale Officer that the jurisdiction of the Estate Officer in respect of hi~ tenancy, E is taken away by the reason that the Controller would F also have the jurisdiction, if the landlord had chos~n to institute the eviction proceedings against the tenant before tbe Controller. After all, it is the choice of the dominis litis to seek the prnpcr forum to vindicate l1is cause o~ action. We have not been shown nny prjnciple or authority to support the argument that jurisdiction which admittedly exists under a particular enactment is to be deemed to be taken away or cut down merely because some other enactment also would have applied if the dominis litis has chosen to institute a proceeding in the other forum. G We are of the view therefore, that no question of conflict between such two enactments can arise, inasmuch as a particular proceeding can be instituted under one of the two acts and the juri8dic:tkn ha~: to b~ considered on the al!egations made by the perscn who institutes the procteding under any of the two Acts. 111e ckfenc~ cannot allege lack H of jurisdiction on the ground that the other Act is also av2ilable for the initiation of such proceeding. Such a question cannot arise unless and until the person initiating the proceedings choose\" to go to the I other forum. 9. It may be also mentioned here that the question of conflict between an order issued under a Central Act and another Central statute had also been brought up before the Supreme Court in Hari- shankar Bagla v.

Such a by-passing, according to the Court's observation at page 392, did not amount to repeal or abrogation of the other Act. We are of the view that it is this kind of harmoniousion which is to be attempted between the two Acts before us. B 10. A'> pointed out above, the objects an<.l policies of the two statutes are quite different from each other. The Delhi Rent Control Act respects the distinction between public premises and other premises which is the basis of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised ,C Occupants) Act, 1971. Section 3 excludes Government premises from the purview of the Delhi Rent Control Act. All that has happened ls that the definition of public premises under the Public Premises (Evic- tion of Unauthorised Occupants) Act is wider than the definition of Government premises under the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1978. But D the policy of the legislature is consistent. It is to exclude public premises from the testriction imposed on eviction and on enhancement of rent by tlie rent control legislation and to take away public premises from such rcsltictions and to enable the owners of public premises not only E to e,'ict the unauthorised occupants expeditiously and to limit the right of appeal, but also to enable the owners of public premises to charge damages fro_m persons in unauthorised occupation. Thfa clearly distin- guishes the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Oc,!upants) Act from the Delhi Rent Control Act. This is an additional reason for the conclusion that if a proceeding is pending under the Public Premises F (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act extraneous considerations based upon the Delhi Rent Control Act cannot be introduced in arguing t1rnt the jurisdiction given by the former Act is somehow taken away by the latter. G 11. For these reasons the three contention<; urged before us fail. As for t:he merits of the question are concerned as to whether a cause of action has arisen for Respondent No. 1 to terminate the lease of the petitioner and thereby render the petitioner as unauthorised occupant H within the definition of \"unauthorised occupant\" in section 2(g) of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 the proper forum is the Estate Officer and the appellate authority is the District Judge. It would not be right for us to consider that question 1 because that would be depriving the petitioner opportunity of adducing the necessary evidence and also the benefit of an appeal under the Act. After a1J, Article 226 of the Constitution is available to the petitioner after final orders under the Act are passed. We are, therefore, not making any observation as to the merits of the case. The writ petition is dismissed on the legal grounds alone without any order as to costs. 2 HC D/80-6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: ILR (Delhi), © 2024 Delhi High Court.
