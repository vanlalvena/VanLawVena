No. 607 of 1991 in Suit No. 3164 of 1990—Decided on 28-10-1991 Civil Procedure Code, 1908—Order 6, Rule 17 and Order 7, Rule 11–– Rejection of plaint—Amendment sought—Suit for recovery of the licencee fee subsequent to notice of revocation of licence—Defendants raising objection that plaint discloses no cause of action—Liable to be rejected—Plaintiff seeking amendment—Contention raised by the defendant that Order 6, Rule 17 is controlled by and is subservient to order O. 7, R. 11—Whether correct? (No). Held: That Courts allow amendments not really as a matter of power but in erformance of its loftier duty to deliver substantial justice. Held further: That this is the righteous path. And, if this be so, it is not necessary in the ends of justice to extend the beneficial legal principles ensconc ed in Order 6, Rule 17? Moreso, when one hardly discerns anything in Order 7, Rule 11 which may lead one to take the view that it takes away the power of the Court to allow amendments or places hurdles in performance of its duty? After all, what is the effect of Order 7, Rule 11? It is, if I understand correctly, that the plaintiff would not be precluded from filing a fresh suit in respect of the same cause of action if he so desires. Result: Petition allowed.

Instead of promoting, it would defeat the ends of Justice. JUDGMENT Jaspal Singh, J.—Is order 6 rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure restricted or controlled by Order 7 rule 11? This is the question which has given birth to this order. 01.-.® SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS LAW ON CIMPIIIlR Vol. xlv Wasudhir Foundation v. C. Lal & Sons & Ors. 557 2. The facts need not detain me for long. A bonsai view would do. The plaintiff has sought recovery of licence fee for a period subsequent to the service of notice of revocation of the license. The defendant states that the plaintiff can lay no claim for licence fee after the revocation of the license and that, consequently the plaint discloses no cause of action. The plaintiff, instead to facing the challenge, is seeking permission to amend the plaint. And, it is this prayer which has generated the heat, for, as per the defendant, the plaint has necessarily to be rejected and Order 7 rule 11 cannot be defeated by taking recourse to Order 6 rule 17 and by amending the plaint Two judgments of this Court namely Edwin Bhave v. Hari Chand1 1982 (1) ILR (Del) 697 and N.D. Khanna v. Hindustan Industrial Corporation2 AIR 1981 Delhi 305 have provided the required ammunition, for, admittedly they do per se lend support to what has been contended by the defendant. 3. Exploiting the judgments to the fullest, it is argued that when a plaint does not disclose a cause of action, it is mandatory upon the Court to reject it under Order 7 rule 11 and that, in such a situation, the Court has no power to permit the plaint to be amended. In short, the contention is that Order 7 rule 11, cannot be allowed to be defeated and destroyed by resort to Order 6, rule 17 since Order 6 rule 17 is controlled by and is subservient to Order 7 rule 11. I regret my inability to agree. 4. There is need to be reminded, lest we forget, that Courts allow amendments not really as a matter of power but in performance of its loftier duty to deliver substantial justice. To quote Bowen L.J. in Cropper v. Smith (1884) 26 Ch. D. 700 at pp. 710-11: \"Now I think it is a well established principle that the object of Courts is to decide the rights of the parties and not to punish them for the mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights. Speaking for myself and in conformity with what 1 have heard laid down by the other divisions of the Courts of appeal and by myself as a member of it. I know of no kind of error or mistake which if not fraudulent or intended to overreach the Court ought not to correct if it can be done without injustice to the other party. Courts do not exist for the sake of discipline but for the sake of deciding mistakes in controversy and I do not regard such amendment as a matter of favour or of grace. Order 28 Rule 1 of the Rules of 1883, which follows previous Legislature on the subject says that All such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties. It seems to me that as soon as it appears that the way in which a party has framed his case will not lead to a decision of the real matter in controversy it is as much a matter of right on his part to have it corrected, if it can be done without injustice as anything else in the case is a matter of right\". 5. This is righteous path. And, if this be so, is it not necessary, in the ends of justice, to extend the beneficial legal principles ensconced in Order 6 rule 17? Moreso, when one hardly discerns anything in Order 7 rule 11 which may lead one to take the view that it takes away the power of the Court to allow amendments or places hurdles in performance of its duty? After all, what is the effect of Order 7 rule 11? It is, if I understand correctly, that the plaintiff would not be precluded from filing a fresh suit in respect of the same 1. 1982 (1) ILR (Del) 697=.=XXI (1982) DLT 209 2. 20 (1981) DLT 236=AIR 1981 Del. 305. 01.-.® SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS LAW ON CIMPIIIlR 558 The Delhi Law Time 1991 cause of action, if he so desires [see Order 7, Rule 13]. If such be the effect, why not permit the amendment of the plaint so as to remove the defect and prevent the operation of the Rule? Why make him first invite the rejection of the plaint, then allow him to file a fresh suit at the expense of delay and heavy costs? Why not straight-away allow him to amend the plaint, remove the defect and permit him, thereby, to proceed with the same suit? Why this rigmarole? After all, procedural law is intended to facilitate and not to obstruct the course of justice. With respect, it has rightly been had in Gaganmal v. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. AIR 1950 Bombay 345: \"It is perfectly true that it is incumbent upon the Court to reject a plaint that does not disclose a cause of action, but it does not follow that it is not open to the Court to allow a plaint to be amended so that it should disclose a cause of action. It is only when a plaint does not disclose a cause of action that the Court is called upon to exercise its power under O. 7 R. 11. But the Court may prevent the operation of O. 7, R. 11, and may save the plaint being rejected by exercising its power under O. 6 R. 17, and allowing the plaint to be amended\". 6. I find myself further fortified by a judgment coming from the Jammu and Kashmir High Court and reported as Amarnath v. Union of India AIR 1979 J and K 47. Even the Supreme Court in Ganesh Trading Co. v. Moji Ram AIR 1978 SC 484 seems to support the view that Order 6, rule 17 would act as panacea where \"entirely new or inconsistent cause of action, amounting virtually to the substitution of a new plaint or a near cause of action in place of what was originally there\" is not sought and that even \"very defective pleadings may be permitted to be cored, so as to constitute a cause of action where there was none, provided necessary conditions, such as payment of either any additional Court fees, which way be payable, or of costs of the other side are complied with\" (emphasis supplied). 7. The ouster of Order 6 Rule 17 will throttle the very life line of Order 7 rule 11. Instead of promoting, it would defeat the ends of justice. I refuse to be a party to such an approach. 8. Before dropping the curtain, a word or two on the two judgments from this Court. Both of them must be taken to be confined to their own facts and in any case, in both, applications for amendment were disallowed by the Court in exercise of its discretion. They must, with respect, be taken to say no more. 9. Order 6 rule 17 is thus held to be neither restricted nor controlled by Order 7 Rule 11. Petition allowed. ___________________ 01.-.® SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS LAW ON CIMPIIIlR","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
