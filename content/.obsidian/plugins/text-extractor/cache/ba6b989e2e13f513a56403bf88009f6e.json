Criminal Appeal No. 292 of 1976t, decided on May 3, 1979 Crimiaal Procedure Code, 1973 - Sections 167 & 3 - Special Judge created by Criminal Law (Amenct.alt) Act, 1952 Is a 'Magistrate llaTIJII jurisdiction' within the meaninc of Section 167 to authorise detention of accused in police custody - General Cla&es Act, 1897, Section 32 Held: The Criminal Procedure Ccxle is applicable when there is no conflict with the provisions of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act. While Section 8 of the Amendment Act empowers the Special Judge to take cognizance of the offenco without the accused being committed to him, neither a Sessions Judge nor a Magistrate is so empowered under the Code. If a Special Judge having such a power is not empowered to exercise powers of remanding an accused person produced before him or release him on bail it will lead to an anomalous situation. (Para 7) Besides, Section 3 of the Code suggests that if the context otherwise requires, the word 'Magistrate' may include Magistrates who are not specified in the section. Read alongwith the definition of 'Magistrate' in Section 32 of the General Clauses Act, the Special Judge can be held to be a Magistrate for the purposes of Section 167. Thus although the words \"Special Judge\" are not mentioned in Section 167, that would not exclude the Special· Judge from being a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try cases under Section 167.

This appeal by certificate is preferred by the State of Tamil Nadu against an order of the Madras High Court in Cr.M .P. Nos. 1582 and 1605 of 1976 dated April 22, 1976. 3. The first respondent V. Krishnaswami Naidu is the son of the second respondent L. Venkataswami Naidu. The first respondent was the Gazetted Personal As&stant to the former Minister for Health, State of Tamil Nadu. He and the second respondent were arrested by the Vigilance and Anti-corrup- tion unit of the Tamil Nadu Police on April 2, 1976 for alleged offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act . They were produced before the Special Judge on the next day i. e . April 3, 197 6. The respondents moved Special Judge for enlargement of bail. The petition was dismissed. The Inspector of Police (Vigilance) moved the Special Judge for committing the respondents to police cust,ody for a period of 15 days. That application was also rejected. In spite of the rejection of this application the police filed Cr.M. P. No. 617 of 1976 before the Special Judge for directing t\\te respondents to be placed under police custody for a period of 15 days. The respondents moved before the High Court Cr.M.P. No . 1582 of 1976 for a direction that the respon- dent should be kept in judicial custody pending investigation of the crime . The respondents also filed another Cr .M .P. No. 1605 of 1976 for quashing the application Cr. M. P. No. 617 of 1976 before the Special Judge by the police for committing the respondents to police custody on the ground that the Special Judge is not a Magistrate as defined in the Criminal Procedure Code and as srich not empowered to act under Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Ct>de and to place the accused in police custody . 4. In order to appreciate the contention raised in thi s appeal it is neces- sary to examine the relevant provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1952 and the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code Act of 1974. The Criminal Law Amendment Act 66 of 1952 was enacted on July 28 , 19!>2 to further amend the Indian Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code , 1898 and to provide for a more speedy trial of offences. It may be noted that the Act is in the nature of an Amending Act in respect of the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 . Section 6 of the Act enables the State Government by notification in the official gazette to appoint as many Special Judges as may be necessary for such area or areas as may be specified in the notification to try offences punishable under Sections 161, 162, 163, 164, 165 or 165A of the Indian Penal Code or Section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act , 194 7, and also in conspiracy to commit or in attempt to commit or in abetment of any of the offences specified. The Special Judge thus appointed to try the offences mentioned shall not be qualified for appointment as a Special Judge under the Act unless he is or has been a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. Section 7 of the Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 or in any other law the offence specified in Section 1 of Section 6 shall be triable by a Special Judge only.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf STATE OF T.N. D. V. ltRWINASWAIII NAIDU (Kailasam, J.) 7 the jurisdiction to try offences mentioned in Section 6(1) is conferred on the Special Judge only. Section 8 is important for the purpose of our disCUS§ion and may be extracted in full. The Special Judge is empowered under this section: (i) to take cognmmce of offence without the accused being com- mitted to him for trial ; and (ii) in trying the accused persons he is required to follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure in the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates. 5. It may be noted that the Special Judge is not a Sessions Judge, Additional Sessions Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge under the Code of Criminal Procedure though no person can be appointed as a Special Judge unless he is or has been either a Sessions Judge or an Adrutional Sessions Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge. The Special Judge is empowered to take cognizance of the offences without the accused being committed to him for trial. The jurisdiction to try the offence by a Sessions Judge is only after committal to him. Further the Sessions Judge does not follow the procedure for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates. The Special Judge is deemed to be a Court of Sessions only for certain purposes as mentioned in Section 8(3) of the Act while the first part of sub-section 3 provides that except as provided in sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 8 the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 shall, so far as they are not inconsistent with this Act, apply to the proceedings before the Special Judge. The sub-section further provides that for the purpose of the said provisions, the Court of the Special Judge shall be deemed to be a Court of Session trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecu- tion before a special judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor. The deemed provision has to be confined for the purposes mentione<l in the ~ub-section. Section 8(2) enables the Special Judge to tender a pardon to a person with a view to obtaining evidence supposed to have been concerned with the commission of an offence and the pardon so tendered was for tlie pur- poses of Section 339 and 339(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. This sub-section was enacted because Special Judge not being a Court to which a commitment has been made cannot tender pardon under the provi- sions of Section 338 and so this section is introduced to enable the Special Judge to tender a pardon. Sub-section 3(a) has made the provisions of Sections 350 and 549 applicable to proceedings before a Special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a Magistrate. Section 350 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enables a suc- ceeding Special Judge to act on the evidence recorded by his predecessor or partly recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by himself. Section 549 empowers a Magistrate when any person is brought before him charged with an offence for which he is liable to be tried by a court to which this Code applies or by a court-martial, the Magistrate shall deliver him to the Com- manding Officer of the Regiment for the purpose of being tried by the court- martial. This provision also is made specifically applicable to the Special Judge.

It will be thus seen that Section 8(1) empowers the Special Judge to take cognizance of offence without committal and directs that in trying the accused persons it shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure. Sub-section 3 deems a Special Judge to be a Court of Session for certain purposes while sub-section (2) empowers the Special Judge to grant a tender of pardon. Sub-section 3(a) makes the provisions of Sec- tions 350 and 549 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applicable to the Special Judge and for the purposes of those provisions the Judge is deemed to be a Magistrate. Under Section 8(A) the Special Judge is empowered to try cases summarily which are triable by the Magistrate. Tbe Special Judge in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act is thus for some purposes deemed to be a Sessions Judge and for some other purposes deemed to be a Magistrate and some powers exercised by the Magistrate are conferred on him. It is necessary to note that Special Judge is empowered to take cognizance without the accused being committed and in trying the accused persons he is required to follow the procedure for trial of warrant cases by a Magistrate. Under Section 8(3) except as regards the provisions in sub- sections (1) and (2) the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure is made applicable insofar as they are not inconsistent with the Criminal Law (Amend- ment) Act. This taken alongwith the fact that the Criminal Law (Amend- ment) Act is an Amending Act so far as the Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Penal Code are concerned the provisions of CrPC should be consi- dered to be in force unless there are certain provisions in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act which is inconsistent with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. 7. We will now examine the provisions of Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code requires that whenever any person is arrested and detained in custody and when it appears that the investigation cannot be completed within a period of 24 hours the police officer is required to forward the accused to the Magistrate. Tbe Magistrate to whom the accused is forwarded if he is not the Magistrate hav- ing jurisdiction to try the case may authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as he thinks fit for a term not exceeding 15 days on the whole. If he has no jurisdiction to try the case and if he consider s that further deten- tion is necessary he may order the accused to be forwarded to any Magistrate having jurisdiction. The Magistrate having jurisdiction may authorise the detention of the accused person otherwise than in custody of the police beyond the period of 15 days but for a total period not exceeding 60 days. In the present case the accused were produced before the Special Judge who admittedly is the person who has jurisdiction to try the case. The contention which found favour with the High Court is that the words 'Magistrate having juris - diction' cannot apply to a Special Judge having jurisdiction to try the case. No doubt the word 'Special Judge' is not mentioned in Section 1.67 but the question is whether that would exclude the Special Judge from being a Magis- trate having jurisdiction to try the case . The provisions of Chapter XII CrPC relate to the information to the police and their powers of investigation .

Section 1 S5(2) Rquires that no police shall take up non~izable case without an order of the Magistrate having power to try such case or commit the case for trial. Again Section· 157 requires that when the police officer has reason to suspect the commission of an offence which he is empowered under Sec- tion l 56 to investigate, he shall forthwith send a report of the same to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of such offence upon a police report. Section 173 requires that on the completion of every investigation under the chapter the officer-in-charge of the police station shall forward to a Magis- trate empowered to take cognizance of the offence a police report as required in the form prescribed. Section 8 of the Criminal Law Amendment specifi- cally empowers the Special Judge to take cognizance of the offence without the accused being committed to him. In taking cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed to him he is not a Sessions Judge for Section 193 CrPC provides that no Court of Session Judge shall take cogni- zance for any offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under the Code. Strictly he is not a Magistrate for no Magistrate can ta'·c cognizance as a Court of Session without committal. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act being an amending Act the provisions are intended to provid~· for a speedy trial of certain offences. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act is not intended to be a complete Code relating to procedure. The provisions of the CrPC are not excluded unless they are inconsistent with th~ Criminal Law (Amendment) Act. Thus read there · could be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the CrPC is applicable when there is no conflict with the provisions of Criminal Law (Amendment) Act. If a Special Judge who is empowered to take cognizance without committal is not empowered to exercise powers of remanding an accused person produced before him or release him on bail it will lead to an anomalous situation. A Magistrate other than a Magistrate having juris- diction cannot keep him in custody for more than 15 days and after the expiry of the period if the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the case does not include the Special Judge, it would mean that he would have no authority to extend the period of remand or to release him on bail. So also if the Special Judge is not held to be a Magistrate having jurisdiction, a charge- sheet under Section 173 cannot be submitted to him. It is relevant to note that the General Clauses Act, Section 32 defines a Magistrate as including every person exercising all or any of the powers of a Magistrate under the Code of Criminal Procedure for the time being in force. Section 3 of the Criminal Ptocedure Code provides that any reference without any qualifying words, to a Magistrate, shall be construed, unless the context otherwise requires in the manner stated in the sub-sections. If the context otherwise requires the word 'Magistrate' may include Magistrates who are not specified in the section. Read alongwith the definition of the Magistrate in the General Clauses Act there can be no difficulty in construing the Special Judg e a,; a Magistrate for the purpo~es of Section 167. 8. In coming to the conclusion that the Special Judge is not a Magis- trate the High Coun strongly relied on a decision of this Court in Major E. G. Barsay v.

Ltd. ~(V~ ® !ONLINE;\" True Prinf 10 SUPREMB COURT CADS (1979) 4 sec Section 549 of the Criminal Procedure Code held that the rule was applicable to only a Magistrate and not to a Special Judge who is not a Magistrate within the meaning of Rule 3. Section 549 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the Central Government to make rules as to cases to which persons subject to military, naval or air force shall be tried by the Court to which this Code applies, or by a court-martial. The Central Government made rules in exercise of the powers conferred on it under this section. Rule 3 which is considered by the Court runs as follows : Where a person subject to military, naval or air force law is brought before a Magistrate and charged with an offence for which he is liable to be tried by a court-martial, such Magistrate shall not proceed to try such person or to inquire with a view to his commit- ment for trial by the Court of Session or the High Court for any offence triable by such Court, unless, {a) he is of opinion, for reasons to be recorded that he ·should so proceed without being moved thereto by competent military, naval or air force authority, or (b) he is moved thereto by such authority. 9. Rule 3, it will be seen, provides that the Magistrate shall not pro- ceed to try such persons or inquire with a view to his commitment for trial by the Court of Session Judge unless he is of opinion that he should so proceed without being moved thereto by such authority. The sub-section, therefore, contemplates a Magistrate who can try the offence himself or inquire with a view to commitment . This part of the section is not applicable to a Special Judge as he cannot inquire with a view to his commitment. There- fore, the Magistrate referred to under Rule 3 cannot include a Special Judge. This Court observed that Section 549 is not one of the sections in Chapter 21 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that it does not empower the Central Government to modify th e warrant procedure and that Rule 3 would not be applicable and further it cannot be said that by reason of the procedure to be followed by a Special Judge he would be a Magistrate empowered to try such a person within the meaning of Rule 3. Relying on this decision the learned Judge held that the same ratio would gov ern the facts of the present case. The learned Judge was in error in applying the decision of this Court relating to Rul e 3 which i~ framed und er Sect10n 549 to Section 167 of the CrPC. The Magistrat e contemplated und er Rule 3 i~ a Magistrate who is empow ered Lo inquire with a view to committal which cannot apply to a Special Judge. 10. In the rcsuil, on cons1derat1on of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Law (Am endment) Act and the CrPC we have no hesitation in coming to a conclusion that a Special Judge would be a Magistrat e empowered to try a case under Section 167 of the CrPC. The Special Judge will proceed to ex ercise the po\\\\ er~ that ar c co nferr ed upon a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the ca~c.
