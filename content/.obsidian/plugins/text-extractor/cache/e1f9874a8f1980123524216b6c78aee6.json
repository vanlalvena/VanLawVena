The defendant contended that the plaintifT having broken the con· tract could not forfeit the amount of Rs. 25,000/· received by him nor claim any compensation. The trial Judge held that the plair.tifT had failed to put the defendant in possession and could not therefore retain Rs. 25,000/· and accordingly directed that on the plaintifT depositing Rs. 25,000/- less Rs. 1,400/- the defendant do put the plaintifT in possession \"{ld awarded to the plaintiff future mesne profits at the rate of Rs. 140/· per mcnscm from the date of the suit until delivery of possession.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SnAH, J.-By a registered deed of lease dated l'vfay HJ, I 027, which was renewed on January 30, 1947, the Delhi Improvement Trust granted lease- hold right~ for 90 years to one Dr. M. 1\\1. Joshi in respect of a plot of land No. 3, 'E' .Block, Qarol Bagh, Delhi, arlmeasuring 2433 sq. yards: Dr. Joshi constructed a building on the land demised to him. Chandrawati. widow of Dr . .Joshi,' as guardian of her minor son Murli Manohar, by sale-deed dated April 21, l!J47, sold the leasehold rights in the land together with the building to Lala Balkishan Das- who will hereinafter be referred to as '.the plaintiff'- for Rs. G3,000/-. By an agreement dated March 21, l!J49 the plaintiff contracted to sell his rights in the land and the building to Seth Fateh Chand-here- inafter called 'the defendant'. It was recited in the agreement that the plaintiff agreed to sell the build- ing together with 'pattridari' rights appertaining to the land admeasuring 2433 sq. yards for Rs. 1,12,500/-, and that Rs. 1,000/- were paid to him as earnest money at the time of the execution of the agreement. The conditions of the agreement were : \"(1) I, the executant, shall deliver the actual possession, i. e. complete vacant possession of kothi (bungalow) to the; vendee on 1\\farch 30, 1949 .. and the vendee shall have to give another cheque for Rs. 24,000/- to me, out of the sale price, (2) Then the vendee shall have to get the sale (deed) registered by the 1st of June, 1949. If, on account of any reason, the vendee fails to get the said sale-deed registered by1June, 1, 1949, then this sum of Rs. 25,000/- (twenty. five thousand) mentioned above shall be deem- ed to be forfeited and the agreement cancelled. 1963 Fateh Chand v. Ralkis/um Das Sha\\, J. I 1963 F.Uh Chan1 v. M.Uisltirn Da1 SM!i, J. 518 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964]VOL. Moreover, the vendee shall have to deliver back the complete vacant possession of the kothi (bungalow) to me, the executant. lf due to certain reason, any delay takes place on my part in the registration of the sale-deed, by !st June 194\\l, tht'.n I, the executant, shall be liable to pay a further sum of Rs. 25,000/· as damages, apart from the aforesaid sum of Rs. 25,000/ · to the vendee, and the bargain shall be deemed to be cancelled.\" The southern boundary of the land was described in the agreement \"Bungalow of Murli Manohar Joshi.\" On March 25, 1949, the plaintiff received Rs. 24,000/· and delivered possession of the building and the land in his occupation to the defendant, but the sale of the property was not completed before the expiry of the period stipulated in the agreement. Each party blamed the other for failing to complete the sale according to the terms of the agreement. Alleging that the agreement was rescinded because the defendant had committed default in performing the agreement and the sum of Rs. 25,000/· paid by the defendant stood forfeited, the plaintiff in an action filed in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Delhi, claimed a decree for possession of the land and building described in the plaint and a decree for Rs. 6,500/ · as compensation for use and occupation of the building from ~larch 25, mm, to January 24, 1950, and for an order directing enquiry as to com· pensation for U5C and occupation of the land and building from the date of the institution of the suit until delivery of possession to the plaintiff. The defendant resisted the claim contending inter alia that the plaintiff having committed breach of the contract could not forfeit the amount of l\\s. 2!l,OOO/· received by him nor claim any compensation. The trial Judge held that the plaintiff had failed to put 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 519 the defendant in possession of the land agreed to be sold and could not therefore retain Rs. 25,000/- received.by him under the contract. He accordingly directed that on the plaintiff depositing Rs. 25,000/- less Rs. 1,400/- (being the amount of mesne profits prior to the date of the suit) the defendant do put the plaintiff in possession of the land and the build- ing, and awarded to the plaintiff future mesne pro- fits at the rate of Rs. l40f- per mensem from the date of the suit until delivery of possession or until expiration of three years from the date of the decree whichever event first occurred. In appeal the High Court of Punjab modified the decree passed by the trial Court and declared \"that the plaintiff was eutitled to retain out of Rs. 25,000{- paid by the defendant under the sale . agreement, a sum ·of Rs. 11,250/-\" being compensation for loss Sl!lffered by him and directed that the plaintiff do get from .the defendant compensation ·for. use and occupation at the rate of Rs. 265/- per mensem. The defendant has appealed to this Court with certificate under Art. Ul3( l )(a) of the Constitution, The first question which falls to be determined in this appeal is as to who committed breach of the contract. The plaintiff's case as disclosed in his pleading and evidence was that he had agreed to sell to the defendant the leasehold rights in the land and building thereon purchased by him from Murli Manohar Joshi by sale-deed dated April 21, 1947, that at the time of execution of the agreement the defendant had inspected the sale deed and the lease executed by the Improvement Trust dated January 3(), 1947 and the sketch plan annexed to the lease, that the plaintiff had handed over to the defendant a copy of that plan and had put the defendant in possession of the property agreed to be sold, but the defendant despite repeated requests failed and neglected to pay the balance remaining due by him and to obtain the sale deed in his favour. 1963 Fateh Chand v. Balkislian Das Shah, J. 1963 Fauh Chuoi v. 'ia/kis\"\"' Da. ~hah, J. 520 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964) VOL. The defendant's case on the other hand was that the plaintiff had agreed to sell the area according to the measurement and boundaries in the plan annexed to the lease granted by the Improvement Trust and had promised to have the southern boundary demarcated and to have a boundary wall built, that at the time of the execution of the agreement of sale the plaintilT rlid not show him the sale deed by which he h.id purchased the property, nor the lease obtained from ti1e Improvement Trust in favour of Dr. Joshi nor even the 'sketch plan,' that the plaintiff had given him a copy of the 'sketch plan' not at the time of the execution of the agreement, hut three or four days after he was put in possession of the premises and that on measuring the site in the light of the plan he discovered that there was a \"shortage on the southern side opposite to Rohtak Road\", that thereupon he approached the plaintiff and repeatedly called upon him to put him in possession of the land as shown in the plan and to get the boundary wall built in his presence but the plaintiff neglected to do so. We have been taken throu~h the relevant evidence by counsel and we agree with the conclusion of the High Court that the defendant and not the plaintiff committed breach of the contract. The i.:~fendant's case is founded primarily on two pleas: 1i) that the plaintiff offered to sell land not according to the dcscri pt ion in the written agreement, hut according to the plan appended to the I mprovemcnt Trust lease, and, that he --the defendant-accepted that offer, ;rnd (ii) The plain,ifI had undertaken to have the southern boundary de1t1arcated and a boun· dary wall built thereon, If the case of the defendant he true, it is a singular I S.C.R SUPREME COURT REPORTS 52l circumstance that those covenants are no found incorporated in the written agreement nor are they referred to in any document prior to the date fixed for completion of the sale. The defendant was put in possession on March 25, 19±9 and he paid Rs. 24,000/- as agreed. If the plaintiff did not put the defendant in possession of the entire area which the latter had agreed to buy, it is difficult to believe that the defendant wm1ld part with a large sum of money which admittedly was to be paid by him at the time of obtaining possession of tl:.~ premises, and in any event h~ wuuld have immediately raised a protest in writing that the plaintiff had not put him in possession of the area agreed to be delivered. It is implicit in the pica of the defendant that he knew that the southern boundary was irregular and that the plaintiff was not in possession of the area a~reed to b-e sold under the agreement. Why then did the defendant not insist that the terms pleaded by him be incorporated in the agreement ? We find no rational answer to that question ; and none has been furnished. The story of the defendant that he agreed to purchase the land according to 'the measurement and boundaries' in the Improvement Trust Plan without even seeing that plan, is impossible of acceptance. It is common ground that according to this plan the land demised was rectangular in shape admeasuring 140' x 160' thottgh the conveyance was in respect of 24:3:1 sq. yards only. Manifestly if the land conveyed to the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff was a perfect rectangle the length of the boundaries must be inaccurate, for the area of a rectangular plot of Ian::! 1-10' x lUO' would be 2488 sq. yards and 8 sq. feet and nJt 2-t:l3 sq. yards. The plaintiff had purchased from his predecessor-in- interest land admeasuri11g 2J33 sq. yards and by the express recital in the agreement the plaintiff agreed to sell that area to the defendant. At the request 1963 Fat rh Clu10d v. BalkishQn Das Shah, /, I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 523 understanding that your client has clear title of the entire area mentioned in the agreement of sale and sketch map attached to it. Long before 1st June, my client noticed that a cer- tain area of the Kothi under sale is under the possession of Shri Murli Manohar Joshi on which his garage stands. Again on the same side Shri Murli Manohar Joshi has got latrines and there is clear encroachment on the land included in the sale. It was clearly understood at the time of bargain that vacant possession of the entire area under sale will be given by your client. My client was anxious to put a wall on the side of Shri Murli Manohar Joshi and when he was actually starting the work this difficulty of garage and latrine came in. Your client was approached x x x.\" One ~thing is noticeable in this letter : according to the defendant, there was a sketch-plan attached to the agreement of sale, and that it was known to the parties at the time of the agreement that a part of the land agreed to be sold had been encroached upon befor~ the agreement by Murli Manohar Joshi. If there had been an \"understanding\" as suggested by the defendant . and if the plaintiff had, in spite of demands made in that behalf by the defendant, failed to carry out the agreement or understanding, we would have expected this version to be set up in the earliest communication and not reserved to be set up as a reply to the plaintiff's assertion that the defen- dant had never complained about any defect in the title of the plaintiff. Acccrding to the written agreement the area agreed to be conveyed was 2433 sq. yards and the land was on the south bounded by the Bungalow of Murli Manohar Joshi. It is common ground that the defendant was put in posse- ssion of an area exceeding 2433 sq. yards, and the land is within the four boundaries set out in the agreement. But the defendant sought to make out 1963 Faleh Clllmll v. Balkishan D01 Shah, /. 1963 F111,J, Clk.nd v. BaWslwi Das Slilli, J 524 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] VOL the case at the trial that he had agreed to purchase land according to the Improvement Trusr plan -a fact which is not incorporated in the agreement, and which has 11ot be.:n mentioned rven in the letter dated June l i, l!H!I. The a;scni ins made bv the defendant in his testimony before the Court, show that not much reliance can be placed upon his word. He stated that the terms of the contract rrlating to forfeiture of Rs. 2ri,OOO/- paid by him in the event of failure to carrv out the terms of the contract were never intended ·to be acted upon and wrre incorpo- rated in the agreement at the inst,mcc of the writer who wrote the deed. !'his plea was never raised in the written statement and the writer of the deed was not question.-d about it. The defendant is mani- festly seeking to add oral terms to the written agree- ment which have not been referred to in the corres- pondence at the earliest opportunitv. We therefore agree with the High Court that the plaintiff carried out his part of the contr;ict to put the defendant in possession of the land agreed to be sold, and was willing to execute the sale-deed, but the defendant failed to pay the balance of the price, and otherwise to show his willingne.ss to obtain .a conveyance. The claim made by the plaintiff to forfeit the sum of Rs. 25,000/- received by him from the defrn- dant must next be considered. This sum of R5. 25,000/- consists of two items-Rs.1,000/- received on l\\farch 21, HJ~!) and referred to in the agreement as 'earnest money' and Rs. 24,0llO!- agreed to be paid by the defendant to plaintiff as \"out of the sale price\" against delivery of possession and paid by the defendant to the plaintiff on March 2;\"\\, l!l4!l when possession of the land and building was delivered to the defendant. The plaintiff submitted that the entire amount of Rs. 2°3,000/- was to be regarded as earnest money. and he claimed to forfeit it on the defendant's failure to carry out his part of 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 525 the contract. This part of the case of the plaintiff was denied by the defendant .. The Attorney-General appearing oa behalf of the defendant has not challenged the plaintiff's right to forfeit Rs. 1,000/- which were expressly named and paid as earnest money. He has, however, contended that the covenant which gave to the plaintiff the right to forfeit Rs. 24,000/- out of the amount paid by the defendant was stipulation in the nature of penalty, and che plaintiff can retain that amount or part thereof only if he establishes that in consequence of the breach by the defendant, he suffered Joss, and in the view of the Court the amount or part thereof is reasonable compensation for that loss. ·We agree with the Attorney-General that the amount of Rs. 24,000/- was not of the nature of earnest money. The agreement expressly provided for . payment of Rs. 1,000/- as earnest money, and that amount was paid by the defendant. The amount of Rs·. 24,000/- was to be paid when vacant possession of the land and building was delivered, and it was expressly referred to as \"out of the sale price.\" If this amount was also to be regarded as earnest money, there was no reason why the parties would not have so named it in the agreement of sale. We are unable to agree with the High Court that this amount was paid as security for due performance of the contract. No such case appears to have been made out in the plaint and the finding of the High Court on that point is based on no evidence. It cannot be assumed ·that because there is a stipulation for forfeiture the amount paid must bear the character of a deposit for due performance of the contract. The claim made by the plaintiff to forfeit the amount of Rs. 24,000/- may be adjudged irt the light of s. 74 of the Indian Contract Act, which in its material part provides :- \"When a contract has been broken, , if a sum is 1963 •• Ba/kislwn Da.s Shali, J. 1963 Fat1h Ch4rsr/ v. Bal.AUh(UI f)OJ Sh.Ii, J. 526 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] VOL. named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract con- tains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the ,party who has broken the contract reasona- ble compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated for.\"· The section is clearly an attempt to eliminate the somewhat elaborate refinements made under the English common law in distinguishing between stipu- lations providing for payment of liquidated damages and stipulations in the nature of penalty. Under the common law a genuine pre-estimate of damages by ·mutual agreement is regarded as a stipulation naming liquidated damages and binding between the parties: a stipulation in a contract in terrorcm is a penalty and the Court refuses to enforce it, awarding to the aggrieved party only reasonable compensation. The Indian Legislature has sought to cut acrµss the web of rules and presumptions under the English common law, by enacting a uniform principle applicable to all stipulations naming amounts to be paid in case of breach, and stipulations by way of penalty- The second clause of the contract provides that if for any reason the vcndee fails to get the sale-deed registered by the date stipulated, the amount of Rs. 25,000/- (Rs. 1,000/- paid as earnest money and Rs. 24,000/- paid out of the price on delivery of possession) shall stand forfeited and the agreement shall be deemed cancelled. The covenant for for- .feiture of Rs. 21,000/- is manifestly a stipulation by way of penalty. Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act deals with the measure of damages in two classes of cases 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 527 • (i) where the contract names a ~um to be paid in case of breach and (ii) where the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty. We are in the present case not concrrned to decide whether a covenant of forfeitnre of deposit for due performance of a contract falls within the first cla~s. The measure of damages in the case of breach of a stipulation by way of penalty is bys. 74 reasonable compensa- tion not exceeding the penalty stipulated for. In assessing damages the Court has, subject to the limit of the penalty stipulated, jurisdiction to award such compensation as it deems reasonalile 11aving regard to all tl\"~ circumstances of the case .. Jurisdiction of the Court to award compensation in case of breach of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated; but compensation has to be reasonable, and that imposes upon t\\ie Court duty to award compensation according 10 settled principles. The section undoubtedly says that the aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the party who has broken the contract, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused by the breach. Thereby it merely dispenses with proof of \"actual loss or damages\"; it does not justify the award of comp\"nsation when in consequence of the breach no legal injury at all has resulted, because compen- sation for breach of contract can be awarded to make good loss or damage which naturally arose in the usual course of things, or which the parties knew when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach. Before turning to the question about the com- pensation which may be awarded to the plaintiff, it is necessary to consider whether s. 74 applies to stipulations for forfeiture of amounts deposited or paid under the contract. It was urged that the section deals in terms with the right to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation and not the right to forfeit what has 1963 Fai.h Clran4 •• Balkisha DIU Shah, J. 1963 F111h Clwiui •• &Ins,... Dai S1.a1i, J. 528 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1964] VOL. already been received by the party aggrieved. There b however no warrant for the assumption made by some of the High Courts in India, thats. 74 applies only to cases where the aggrieved party is seeking to receive some amount on breach of contract and not to cases where upon breach of contract an amount recei- ved under the contract is sought to be forfeited. In our judgment the expression \"the contract contains any other stipulation by way of pena]Jy'· comprehen- sively applies to every covenant involving a penalty whether it is for payment on breach of contract of money or delivery of property in future, or for forfei- ture of right to money or other property already delivered. Duty not to enforce the penalty clause but only to award reasonabie compensation is statutorily imposed upon courts bys. H. In all cases, therefore, where there is a stipulation in the nature of penalty for forfeiture of an amount deposited pursuant to the terms of contract which expressly provides for forfei· ture, the court has jurisdiction to award such sum only as it considers reasonable, but not exceeding the amount specified in the contract as liable to forfeiture. We may briefly refer to certain illustrative cases decided by the High Courts in India which have expressed a different view. In Abdul Gani ,(; Co. v. Truster;s of the Port of Bombay (1), the Bombay High Court observed as as follows :- \"lt will be noticed that the sum which is named in the contract either as penalty or as liquidated damages is a sum which has not already been paid but is to be paid in case of a breach of the contract. With regard to the stipulation by way of P.enalty. the Legislature has chosen to qualify 'stipulation' as 'any other stipulation', indicating that the stipula- tion must be of the nature of an amount to be paid and not an amount already (I) l,L.R, 1952 llom. 7i7, 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 5211 paid. prior to the entering into of the contract. The section further provides that a party com- plaining of a breach is entitled to receive from the party who has broken the contract reaso- nable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or the peµalty stipulated for. There- fore, the section clearly contemplates that the party aggrieved has to receive from the party in default some amount or something in the nature of a penalty : it clearly rules out the possibility of the amount which has already been received or the penalty which has already been provided for.\" In Natesa Aiyar v. Appavu Padayschi (1), the Madras High Court seems to have held thats. 74 applies where a sum is named as penalty to be paid in future in case of breach, and not to cases where-a sum is already paid and by a covenant in the contract it is liable to forfeiture. In these cases the High Courts appear to have concentrated upon the words \"to be paid in case of such breach\" in the first condition in s. 74 and did not consider the import of the expression \"the con- tract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty\", which is the second condition mentioned in the section. The words \"to be paid\" ·which appear in· the first condition do not qualify the second condition relating to stipulatidn by way of penalty. The expression \"if the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty\" widens the operation of the section so as to make it applicable to all stipulations by way of penalty, whether the stipulation is to pay ·an amount of money, or is of another character, as, for example, providing for forfeiture of money already paid. There is nothing in the expression which implies that the stipulation must be one for rendering something after the contract is broken.- There is no ground for holding that the expression \"contract contains any (I) (1913) I.L.R. 38 Mad. 178. 1'63 Fateh Ch>nd v. Bslkislum B•s Sh.,\\, J. '\". 1953 . Fa1,h Chand v. Ba!K.ishan Das Shah, J. \";-, '_,,--· ·-... 530 SUPREME coI.JR.i' REPORTS [1964] ·Vot. other stipulation by way of penalty\" is limited to cases of stipulation in the nature of ·an agreement to pay money or deliver property on breach and does · not comprehend covenants under which amounts paid - or property delivered under the· contract, which by the terms of the contract expressly or by clear impli- cation are liable to be forfeited. Section 74 declares the law as to liability upon breach of contract where compensation is by agree- ment of the parties pre-determined, or wher.e there is a stipulation by way of penalty. But the application. of the enactment is not restricted to cases where the aggrieved p;:irty claims relief as a plaintiff. The ~ection does not confer a special benefit upon any party; it merely declares the law that notwithstanding any term in ·the' contract predetermining ··damages or providing for fprfeiture of any property by way of penalty, the . court will· award to . the party ag~ grieved only rcascicc able compensation not exceeding ·the amount namd or penalty stipulated. The juris: diction of the court is not determined by the acci- dental circumstance of the party in default being a plaintiff or a defendant in a suit. Use of the expres- sion \"to receive from the party who has broken · the .contract\" does not predicate that the jurisdiction of the court to adjust amounts which have been paid by the party in default cannot be exercised in dealing with the claim of the party complaining of breach of con- tract. The. court has to adjudge in every case re- asonable compensation to which the plaintiff . is entitled from the defendant on breach of the contract •. Such compensation has to\" be ascertained having re- ~ard to the conditions existing on the date of the breach. · There is no evidence that any loss was suffered by the plaintiff in consequence of the default by · the defendant save as to the loss suffered by him by being kept out of possession of the property. · 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COUkT REPORTS 531 There is no evidence that the property had depre- ciated in value since the date of the contract; nor was there evidence that any other special damage had resulted. The contract provided for forfeiture of Rs. 25,000/- consisting of Rs. 1000/-paid as earnest money and Rs. 24,000/- paid as part of the purchase price. The defendant has conceded that the plaintiff was entitled to forfeit the amount of Rs. 1,000/-which was paid as earnest money. We cannot however agree with the High Court that 10 per cent of the price may be regarded as reasonable compensa- tion in relation to the value of the contract as a whole, as that in our opinion is assessed on arbitrary assumption. The plaintiff failed to prove the loss suffered by him in consequence of the breach of the contract committed by the defendant, and we are unable to find any principle on which compensation equal to ten i: ercent of the agreed price could be awarded to the plaintiff. The plaintiff has been allowed Rs. 1,000/-which was the earnest money as part of the damages. Besides he had use of the remaining sum of Rs. 24,000/-, and we can rightly presume that he must have been deriving advantage from that amount throughout this period. In the absence therefore of any proof of damave arising from the breach of the contract we are of opinion that the amount of Rs. 1,000/- (earnest money) which has been forfeited, and the advantage that the plaintiff must have derived from the possession of the remaining sum of Rs. 24,000/-during all this period would be sufficient compensation to him. It may be added that the plaintiff has separately claimed mesne profits for being kept out of possession for which he has got a decree and therefore the fact that the plaintiff was out of possession cannot be taken into account in determining damages for this purpose. The decree passed by the High Court awarding Rs. 11,250/- as damages to the plaintiff must there- fore be set aside. 1963 Ji'«teh Chvii •• Ballcishan D«S Shah, J. '. 1963 . Fo!eh Clumd •• Blllkisltari Du SJ..o, J. I \\ 532 SUPREME.COURT REPORTS £1964] VOL. The other ·question which ~~mains to be deter· mined relates to the . amount of mesne profits which the plaintiff is entitled to\\ receive from the defendant who kept the plaintiff. out of the property after the bargain had fallen through. It · is common ground . that the defendant is liable · for retaining possession _to pay compensation' from June 1, 1949 tilI the date of the suit . and thereafter under 0. 20, r. 12 (c) C. P. Code till the date on which the possession was delivered.'- The trial Court assessed compensation at the rate of Rs. 140/- per mensem. The High Court awarded compensation at the rate of Rs. 265/-per mensem. In an:iving at this rate the High Court · adopted a highly artificial method. The High Court , observed that even though the agreement for sale of the property was for a consideration ofRs.1,12,500/- the plaintiff had purchased the property in l!J47 for Rs. 63,000/- and that at the· date of the suit that amount could be regarded as \"the value for which the property could be ~()[d at any time.\" The High Court then thought thanhe proper rate of compen· sation for use and occupation of the house by the defendant when he rufused to give ·up possession after failing to complete the contract should· have some relation to the value of the property and not to the price agreed as sale price between the parties, and computing damages at 'the . rate of five per cent on the value of the property they held that ·_Rs. 3,150/- was the annual loss . suffered by the plaintiff by being kept out of. possession, and on that footing awarded mesne profits at the rate of Rs. 265/-per mensem prior to the date of the suit and thereafter. The plainiiff is undoubtedly entitled to · mesne proliu from the defendant and 'mesne profits~ as defined in s. 2 (12) of the Code of Civil Procedure are profits which the person in wrongful possession of property . actually received or might with ordinary diligence have received therefrom, together with · interest on such profits, but do not include profits due to improvements made by_ the person in wrongful ... 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 533 -~ , ~·~--~--·- --·-·- 'possession. The normal measure of mesne profits is ·.therefore the value of the user of land to the person· _in wrongful possession. The assessment made by the High Court of compensation at the rate of five per cent of what they regarded as the fair value of the property is based not cin the value of the user, but on an estimated .. return on the value of the property, cannot be sustained: The Attorney-General conten- ded that the premises ~ere governed by the Delhi & Ajmer-Merwara Rent ,Control Act XIX of 1947 and nothi,ng more than the 'standard reu.t' of the property assessed under that Act could be awarded to the plaintiff as damages. Normally a person in wrongful possession of immovable property ha·s to pay com- pensation corpputed on the basis of profits he_ actually received or with ordinary diligence mighf have received.· It is not necessary to consider in the pre- sent case whether riiesne profits at a rate exceeding . the rate of standard rent of the house may be awar- ded, for there is no evidence as to what the ~standard rent' of the house was. From the evidence on' the record it appears that a tenant \\vas in occupation for a long time before 1!14 7 of the house in dispute in this appeal and another house for an aggregate rent of Rs. ·180/- per mensem, and that after .the house in dispute was sold, the plaintiff I\"eceived rent from· that tenant at the rate' of Rs. 80/- per mensem, and to the· vendor of the plaintiff at the rate of Rs. 106/, per mensem. But this is.· not evidence. of standard rent within the meaning· of the Delhi and Ajmer- 1\\ferwara Rent_ Control Act, XIX of 1!)4 7. The SubordinateJudge· awarded mesne profits at the rate of Rs. 140/- per mensem and,unless it is shown by the defendant that that was excessive we would not be justified in interfering with tJie amount awarded by the Subordinate Judge .. A slight modi- fication, however, needs to be made. The plaintiff is not only entitled to mesne profits at the monthly· rate fixed by the Trial Court, but is alsq entitled to · ; 1953 Fat1h Chand v. Balkishan Du SW., J. 196~ Faleh Chand v. l11l!ishaJJ Da.s ~w.. J, 534 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1964] VOL. interest on such profits vidc s. 2( I~) of the Code of Civil Procedure. We, therefore, direct that the mesne profits be computed at the rate of Rs. 140/- pcr mensem from .J unc 1, 1949 till the date .on which possession was deli\\·ered to the plaintiff (such period not exceeding three years from the date of decree) together with interest at the rate of six percent on the amount accruing due month after month. The ·decree passed by the High Court will therefore be modified. It is ordered that the plaintiff is entitled to retain out of Rs. 25,000/- only Rs.1,000/- received by him as earnest money, and that he is en- titled to compensation at the rate of Rs. 140/- per mensem and interest on that sum at the rat~ of six percent as it accrues due month after month from June I, )!JIU, till the date of delivery of possession, subject to the restriction prescribed by 0.20 r. 12 (i) (c) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Subject to these modifications, thi> appeal will be dismissed. In view of the divided success, we direct that the parties will bear their own costs in this Court. Decree m.odified.
