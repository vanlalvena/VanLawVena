SHAH, J.- Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 14-8-2018 1 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in FAO(OS) No. 112 of 2018 by which the High Court has partly allowed the said appeal, Indian Railway Construction Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"IRC0N\") has preferred the present appeal. 2. The brief facts leading to filing of the present appeal in a nutshell are as under: That, an agreement was entered into between IRC0N and the respondent -M/s National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"NBCC\"), whereby the respondent was awarded the work of construction of Railway Station-cum-Commercial Complex at Vashi, Navi Mumbai at a cost of Rs 3042.91 lakhs, to be constructed within a period of 30 months from 5-4-1990. NBCC failed to complete the work in time. Thereafter, the supplementary agreements were entered into between the parties. As the provision for grant of advances had exhausted, NBCC approached IRC0N with modified programme for completion of works and sought for additional financial aid on certain terms and conditions. IRCON in consultation with Cmco, agreed to grant advance as a special case against bank guarantee. Accordingly, a supplementary agreement dated 17-12-1991 was entered into between the parties providing for special advance of an amount of Rs 68 lakhs bearing interest @18% p.a. on furnishing of bank guarantee. In terms of the supplementary agreement dated 17-12-1991, a special advance of Rs 68 lakhs was also given to NBCC. As there was delay in the work of NBCC and the work was practically abandoned and came to a standstill, IRC0N served on NBCC a notice dated 21-2-1994 terminating the contract relying upon Clause 60.1 of the agreement. 3. That, thereafter, after some litigation before the Delhi High Court, NBCC invoked the arbitration clause. The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted. The l Indian Railway Construction Co. Ltd. v.

Arbitral Tribunal passed the award dated 4-11-2011. That the Arbitral Tribunal rejected NBCC' s claim for refund of two security deposits i.e. Claims 33 and 34. While holding so, the Arbitral Tribunal held that though termination with reference to Clause 60.1 was bad in law, but justified the termination with reference to Clause 17.4 of the contract and consequently rejected NBCC' s claim for refund of two security deposits i.e. Claims 33 and 34. The Arbitral Tribunal also partly allowed Counterclaim 3 in favour ofIRCON. Counterclaim 3 was relatable to the counterclaim ofIRCON for a total ofRs 3,65,38,806 towards interest on various advances given to NBCC, more particularly, with regard to two specific advances being (]) special advance and (2) advance against hypothecation of equipment. 4. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal and insofar as relating to Claims 33 and 34 and Counterclaim 3 which were in favour of IRCON, NBCC approached the High Court by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Arbitration Act\"). The application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act was confined to the aforesaid three claims/ counterclaims respectively viz. Claims 33 and 34 and Counterclaim 3 only. 5. By the judgment and order dated 3-3-2017, the learned Single Judge of the High Court set aside the rejection by the learned Arbitral Tribunal of Claims 33 and 34 of NBCC to the extent it concerned the return of security deposit amounts i.e. Rs 5,57,486 + Rs 60,85,840 by observing and concluding that once the Arbitral Tribunal found that the termination with regard to Clause 60.1 was not justified, it was not open for the Arbitral Tribunal thereafter to consider the termination under Clause 17.4 justifying forfeiture of the security deposits. The learned Single Judge of the High Court also set aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on Counterclaim 3 by observing that there is no clause in the contract in particular awarding 18% interest per annum on special advance. 6. The judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge was the subject-matter of appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act before the Division Bench 1 of the High Court. By the impugned judgment and order1, the Division Bench of the High Court has partly allowed the said appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act to the extent upholding the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal insofar as awarding the interest on special advance is concerned. The rest of the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge has been affirmed/confirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court. 7. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order1 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court, IRCON has preferred the present appeal. l Indian Railway Construction Co.

Hegde, learned counsel has appeared on behalf of the appellant, IRCON and Shri Arvind Minocha, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent, NBCC. 9. Shri R.S. Hegde, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has vehemently submitted that on appreciation of entire evidence and the material on record as the learned Tribunal has observed and held that IRCON was justified in rescinding the contract due to abandonment of work by NBCC and when the said finding attained finality, IRCON was justified in forfeiting the security deposits. It is submitted that as such the High Court has taken too technical view. It is submitted that as such both, Clause 17.4 and Clause 60.1 are required to be read together. It is submitted that the main aspect which is required to be considered is whether NBCC failed to complete the work as per the contract and whether NBCC abandoned the work and thereafter, having satisfied that even during the extended period, NBCC was not able to complete the work, the contract was rightly rescinded and therefore, the security deposits were liable to be forfeited. 9.1. It is submitted that therefore both the learned Single Judge (in application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act) and the Division Bench of the High Court have materially erred in upsetting/quashing and setting aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claims 33 and 34. 9.2. It is submitted that both, the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court have materially erred in not appreciating the fact that once the termination is justifiable with reference to the terms of the contract and even if a wrong clause is mentioned in the letter terminating the contract, the power to terminate the contract cannot be said to be illegal, more particularly, when the power is traceable to the specific terms of the contract i.e. Clause 17.4. 9.3. Now, so far as Counterclaim 3 is concerned, it is submitted that as such the Division Bench of the High Court has set aside the award of interest on the amount advanced against hypothecation of equipments, on the ground that there is no such provision of award of interest in the contract/supplementary agreements. It is submitted that however, the Division Bench of the High Court has not properly appreciated the fact that there is no bar to award interest on the amount advanced. It is submitted that the arbitrator has power to award interest pendente lite unless specifically barred from awarding it. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in Raveechee & Co. v. Union of India2. 10. Making the above submissions, it is prayed to allow the present appeal and restore the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal. 11. The learned Senior Counsel, Mr Minocha appearing on behalf of the respondent NBCC while supporting the impugned judgment and order1 passed by the High Court has vehemently submitted that in the present case admittedly IRCON invoked Clause 60.1 and rescinded the contract. It is submitted that even the learned Arbitral Tribunal also observed and held that IRCON was not justified in rescinding the contract under Clause 60.1.

It is submitted that the finding recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal that the contract could not have been rescinded under Clause 60.1 had attained the finality. It is submitted that therefore the learned Arbitral Tribunal was not justified in rejecting Claims 33 and 34 which has rightly been set aside by the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench, which are not required to be interfered with by this Court in exercise of limited jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. 11.2. It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent NBCC that in the absence of any specific provision in the contract/supplementary agreements on interest on the amount advanced against hypothecation of equipments, the Division Bench of the High Court has rightly set aside the same. 12. Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal. 13. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties at length. 14. As observed hereinabove, challenge to the award by the learned Arbitral Tribunal before the learned Single Judge and now before this Court is with respect to Claims 33 and 34 and Counterclaim 3 (partly). 15. The learned Arbitral Tribunal rejected Claims 33 and 34 which were with respect to forfeiture of the security deposits on termination/rescind of the contract. Counterclaim 3 of IRCON was for a total sum of Rs 3,65,38,806 towards interest on various advances given to NBCC, more particularly, with regard to two specific advances being (1) special advance and (2) advance against hypothecation of equipment. The learned Arbitral Tribunal allowed Counterclaim 3 and awarded interest @18% p.a. in favour of IRCON being interest on special advance and advances against hypothecation of equipments. The Division Bench of the High Court has partly allowed the appeal and allowed the interest in favour of IRCON @18% so far as special advance is concerned. 16. While considering the findings recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal and while appreciating the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties, relevant clauses of the agreement, more particularly, Clauses 17.4, 59.1, 60.1 are required to be referred to, which are as under: \"TIME TO BE OR THE ESSENCE OF THE CONTRACT: 17.4.

Considering the material on record and on appreciation of evidence, the learned Arbitral Tribunal though observed that IRCON was not justified in rescinding the contract under Clause 60.1, rescinding of the contract/ termination of the contract was justified under Clause 17.4, and thereby has rejected Claims 33 and 34 of NBCC which were with respect to forfeiture of the security deposits. The learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court have set aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claims 33 and 34 inter alia on the ground that once the Arbitral Tribunal gave the finding that IRCON was not justified in invoking Clause 60.1, thereafter it was not open for the Arbitral Tribunal to take the help of Clause 17.4 and therefore, the learned Arbitral Tribunal was not justified in rejecting Claims 33 and 34 which were with respect to forfeiture of security deposits, which could have been under Clause 17.4. 18. However, it is required to be noted that as such the finding recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal on applicability of Clause 17.4 and/or rescinding of the contract under Clause 17.4 has not been set aside either by the learned Single Judge or by the Division Bench of the High Court and therefore, the findings recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on applicability of Clause 17.4 has attained finality. The learned Arbitral Tribunal as such was absolutely justified in considering whether IRCON was justified in rescinding the contract, may be either under Clause 60.1 or under Clause 17.4. 19. Even otherwise, from the material on record and even the notice dated 21-2-1994 and the subsequent notice dated 7-3-1994, we are satisfied that IRCON was satisfied that the work could not be completed by the contractor even within further extension of time. Clause 17.4 provides that if the company (IRCON) is not satisfied that the works can be completed by the contractor and in the event of failure on the part of the contractor to complete the works within further extension of time allowed, IRCON shall be entitled, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available in that behalf, to appropriate the contractor's security deposits and rescind the contract, whether or not actual damage is caused by such default. 20.

Shah, J.) made good and carry on the work or comply with such directions as aforesaid to the entire satisfaction of the Project Manager, the Company (IRCON) shall be entitled after giving 48 hours notice in writing under the hand of the Project Manager (to remove the contractor from the whole or any portion or portions as may be specified in such notice) of the works without thereby avoiding the contract or releasing the contractor from any of his obligations or liabilities. It further provides that in such a case the Project Manager on behalf of IRCON shall be entitled to rescind the contract, in which case the security deposit shall stand forfeited to IRCON without prejudice to IRCON' s right to recover from the contractor any amount by which the cost of completing the works by any other agency shall exceed the value of the contractor. 21. Thus, both, under Clauses 17.4 and 60.1, on failure of the contractor to complete the work, IRCON is justified in rescinding the contract and forfeit the security deposit. At the cost of repetition it is observed that the learned Arbitral Tribunal on appreciation of entire evidence on record, had specifically observed that the contractor failed to complete the work even within the stipulated extended period of time and even abandoned the work and therefore, IRCON was justified in rescinding the contract. The said finding as observed hereinabove has attained finality. Therefore, IRCON was absolutely justified in forfeiting the security deposits and therefore, the learned Arbitral Tribunal was absolutely justified in rejecting Claims 33 and 34, which were with respect to forfeiture of security deposits by IRCON. 22. Both, the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court have seriously erred in setting aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claims 33 and 34. We are of the opinion that the learned Single Judge, therefore, exceeded in its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act quashing and setting aside the well-reasoned award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on rejecting Claims 33 and 34, which the Division Bench of the High Court has wrongly affirmed. 23. Under the circumstances, the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court quashing and setting aside the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claims 33 and 34 deserve to be quashed and set aside and the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claims 33 and 34 is required to be restored and upheld. 24. Now, so far as quashing and setting aside the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal awarding interest @18% on advance for the hypothecation of equipment, by the learned Single Judge confirmed by the Division Bench is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that the Division Bench of the High Court has upheld the order passed by the learned Single Judge quashing and setting aside the interest awarded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on advance for the hypothecation of equipment on the ground that there is no such stipulation in the agreement/contract. However, the High Court has not at all considered Section 31(7)(a) of the Arbitration Act, which permits the arbitrator that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and insofar as an arbitral award is for the payment of money, the Arbitral Tribunal may ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Thus, unless there is a specific bar under the contract, it is always open for the arbitrator/ Arbitral Tribunal to award pendente lite interest. 25. Identical question came to be considered by this Court in Raveechee2 . In the said decision, it is observed and held by this Court that an arbitrator has the power to award interest unless specifically barred from awarding it and the bar must be clear and specific. In the said decision, it is observed and held that the liability to pay interest pendente lite arises because the claimant has been found entitled to the same and had been kept out from those dues due to the pendency of the arbitration i.e. pendente lite. 26. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decision in Raveechee and Co. 2 to the facts of the case on hand, once it was found that the advance amount was paid for hypothecation of equipment and thereafter when the Arbitral Tribunal awarded the interest on advance for hypothecation of equipment, the same was not required to be interfered with by the learned Single Judge in exercise of the powers under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and even by the Division Bench of the High Court while exercising the powers under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. However, at the same time to award the interest @ 18 % can be said to be on a higher side. In the facts and circumstances of the case, if the interest is awarded @ 12% on advance for the hypothecation of equipment, the same can be said to be reasonable interest. 27. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal succeeds. The impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court quashing and setting aside the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claims 33 and 34 are hereby quashed and set aside and the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal rejecting Claims 33 and 34 is hereby restored. The impugned judgment and order1 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court in confirming the judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge insofar as quashing and setting aside the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal awarding the interest @18% on the advance for hypothecation of equipment is concerned, the same is hereby quashed and set aside and the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal awarding the interest on advance for hypothecation of equipment is hereby restored, however, with a modification that there shall be paid an interest @ 12% pendente lite on advance for hypothecation of equipment instead of 18% as awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal. 28. The present appeal is accordingly allowed to the aforesaid extent. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs. a b C d e f g 2 Raveechee & Co. V.
