Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 586 SUPREME COURT CASES Dismissing the appeal, the Supreme Court Held: Per A.S. Bopanna, J. (2020) 15 sec The very purpose for which the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (\"the Commercial Courts Act, 2015\") has been enacted would be defeated if every other suit (i.e. suit as to non-commercial dispute) merely because it is filed before the Commercial Court is entertained. This is for the reason that the suits which are not actually relating to commercial dispute but being filed merely because of the high value and with the intention of seeking early disposal would only clog the system and block the way for the genuine commercial disputes which may have to be entertained by the Commercial Courts as intended by the lawmakers. In commercial disputes as defined, a special procedure is provided for a class of litigation and a strict procedure will have to be followed to entertain only that class of litigation in that jurisdiction. If the same is strictly interpreted it is not as if those excluded will be non-suited without any remedy. The excluded class of litigation will in any event be entertained in the ordinary civil courts wherein the remedy has always existed. (Para 13) In view of the above, it is necessary to carefully examine and entertain only disputes which actually answer the definition of \"commercial dispute\" as provided under the Commercial Courts Act. In terms of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the disputes arising out of agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce will qualify to be a commercial dispute to be tried by Commercial Courts. In the instant case, neither the agreement between the parties refers to the nature of the immovable property being exclusively used for trade or commerce as on the date of the agreement nor is there any pleading to that effect in the plaint. Further the very relief sought in the suit is for execution of the mortgage deed which is in the nature of specific performance of the terms of Memorandum of Understanding without reference to nature of the use of the immovable property in trade or commerce as on the date of the suit. Therefore, if all these aspects are kept in view, the High Court was justified in its conclusion arrived through the impugned order (directing the Commercial Court to return the plaint). The Commercial Court shall therefore return the plaint indicating a date for its presentation before the Court having jurisdiction. (Paras 14 and 6) Federation of A.P.

INFRASPACE LLP that the said Act has been enacted for the purpose of providing an early disposal of high value commercial disputes. A purposive interpretation of the Statement of Objects and Reasons and various amendments to the Civil Procedure Code leaves no room for doubt that the provisions of the Act require to be strictly construed. If the provisions are given a liberal interpretation, the object behind constitution of Commercial Division of Courts viz. putting the matter on fast track and speedy resolution of commercial disputes, will be defeated. If one takes a closer look at the Statement of Objects and Reasons, words such as \"early\" and \"speedy\" have been incorporated and reiterated. The object shall be fulfilled only if the provisions of the Act are interpreted in a narrow sense and not hampered by the usual procedural delays plaguing our traditional legal system. (Paras 36, 31, 35 and 42) Thus, a dispute relating to immovable property per se may not be a commercial dispute. But it becomes a commercial dispute, if it falls under sub-clause (vii) of Section 2(l)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act viz. \"the agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce\". The conclusion arrived at herein, that in order to fall within Section 2(l)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the immovable property must be \"used exclusively\" or \"being used exclusively\" in trade or commerce, is agreed to. The words \"used exclusively in trade or commerce\" are to be interpreted purposefully. The word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be either \"ready for use\" or \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". It should be \"actually used\". Such a wide interpretation would defeat the objects of the Act and the fast tracking procedure for deciding the commercial disputes. (Paras 37 and 16) In the present case, there is nothing on record to show that at the time when the agreement to sell came to be executed in 2012, the property was being exclusively used in trade and commerce so as to bring the dispute within the ambit of sub- clause (vii) of Section 2(l)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act. Merely because the property is likely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same cannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court.

The Judgments* of the Court were delivered by 589 594b 594d A.S. BOPANNA, J. (Banumathi, J. concurring)- Leave granted. The appellant herein is the plaintiff in Commercial Court Suit No. 41/2018 filed before the Commercial Court at Vadodara. The respondents herein are arrayed as the defendants to the suit. The respondents on being notified in the suit had appeared and filed the written statement inter alia contending that the suit is not maintainable as the dispute involved cannot be termed as a commercial dispute within the meaning of Section 2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (\"the CC Act, 2015\" for short). In view of such contention, the respondents herein also filed an application under Order 7 Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking an order to return the plaint to be presented in the court in which the suit should have been instituted. The appellant herein though did not choose to file objection to the said application, had however opposed the same. The application was registered as Ext. 15 and the learned Judge of the Commercial Court on consideration had through the order dated 17-10-2018 rejected the application. The respondents herein claiming to be aggrieved by the said order had approached the High Court of Gujarat in R/Special Civil Application No. 17868 of 2018. 2. The High Court through a detailed order dated 1-3-2019 1 has allowed the petition, set aside the order dated 17-10-2018 passed by the Commercial Court, Vadodara and on allowing the application filed under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC directed that the plaint be returned to the appellant herein to be presented in the court in which the suit should have been instituted. The appellant herein, therefore, claiming to be aggrieved by the order dated 1-3-2019 1 is before this Court in this appeal. 3. The brief facts which led to the present situation is that the appellant herein executed an agreement to sell dated 14-2-2012 in favour of Respondent 2 in respect of the land which is described in the agreement. Respondent 2 assigned and transferred all his rights under the said agreement to sell in favour of Respondent 1 by executing an assignment deed dated 12-10-2017. In that view, Respondent 1 herein was to purchase the lands which were the subject- matter of the agreement from the appellant herein. Accordingly, the sale was made under a deed of conveyance dated 3-11-2017. Since certain other aspects were to be completed regarding the change relating to the nature of the use of the land for conclusion of the transaction, the right of the appellant in respect of the land was to be protected. In that view a Memorandum of Understanding dated 3-11-2017 was entered into between the appellant and the respondents * Ed.: Banumathi, J. delivered a concurringjudgment 1 K.S. Infraspace LLP v.

Accordingly, a mortgage deed dated 3-11-2017 was executed but the same had not been registered. It is in that light the appellant herein filed Commercial Civil Suit No. 41/2018 so as to enforce the execution of a mortgage deed. Consequently, the relief of permanent injunction and other related reliefs were sought. It is in the said suit, summon was issued to the respondents herein who are the defendants in the suit, wherein on filing the written statement the application under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC was filed. The Commercial Court while rejecting the application had referred to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the appellant Company and in that light taking note of the business that they were entitled to undertake has arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff seems to be carrying on the business as an estate agent and in that circumstance has further arrived at its conclusion that it is a commercial dispute. The High Court on the other hand had found fault with the manner in which the Commercial Court had rested its consideration on the Memorandum and Articles of Association and had examined the matter in detail to come to a conclusion that the immovable property in the instant case was not being used for trade or commerce. In that regard, the legal position enunciated by the various decisions was referred to and had accordingly directed the return of the plaint to be presented in an appropriate court which is assailed herein. 5. We have heard Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate for the appellant, Shri Deven Parikh, learned Senior Advocate for the respondents and perused the appeal papers. 6. At the outset, it is noticed that the consideration required in the instant case is as to whether the transaction between the parties herein which is the subject-matter of the suit could be considered as a \"commercial dispute\" so as to enable the Commercial Court to entertain the suit. In that regard, it is necessary to take note of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the CC Act, 2015. The said provision to the extent relevant is extracted here below for reference. \"2. Definition.-(!) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires- (a)-(b) * * * (c) \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of- (i)-( vi) * * * (vii) agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce; (viii)-(xxii) * * *\" From a perusal of the provision relied upon by the learned Senior Advocates it is noticed that the disputes arising out of agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce will qualify to be a commercial dispute to be tried by Commercial Courts.

The learned Senior Advocate for the appellant has made detailed submissions referring to the documents to contend that the appellant was running an industry in the land concerned which was acquired for that purpose and presently Respondent 1 has purchased the same for developing the said land and in that view the land is one which is used for trade and commerce. The b learned Senior Advocate for the respondents on the other hand has contended to the contrary that the appellant had ceased to function for the past several years and the company being defunct, the land involved was not being used for trade or commerce and even though Respondent 1 has sought for change of land use and to develop the land, the same would be subject to such change of land use that would be granted and the use to which it would be put in future. Hence c it is contended that as on the date of transaction the land is not being used for trade or commerce and a suit at present would not be maintainable before the Commercial Court. 8. Though such rival contentions are put forth by the learned Senior Advocate on either side, these aspects cannot be dealt with in abstract. Instead the nature of the dispute and the jurisdiction to try the same is to be reflected in d the suit itself since in a civil suit the pleadings, namely, averments in the plaint would at the outset be relevant to confer jurisdiction. Hence before adverting to the other aspects it would be necessary to carefully examine the plaint. The plaintiff has in detail referred to the nature of the transaction between the appellant and the respondents herein. In Para 5 thereof the detail of the land bearing R.S. No. 122 corresponding to City Survey Nos. 1101 and 1100/1 e having land area of 9207 sq m at Mouje Subhanpura Reg. District, Vadodara is referred. Further the schedule of the property is indicated in Para 6 and reference is made to the Memorandum of Understanding where again the reference is made to the land. It is averred therein that it would be the total responsibility of Respondent 1 herein (Defendant 2 in the suit) to change the land use as well as to pay the amount that may be required for the permission. f The amount to be paid as premium is referred and the right of the plaintiff to secure the mortgage deed in view of the terms of the Mo U is stated. In the entire plaint there is no reference to the nature of the land or the type of use to which it was being put as on the date of the agreement to sell/sale deed/memorandum of understanding or as on the date of the suit. 9. Further on referring to the cause of action in Para 21, the plaintiff has 9 thereafter referred in Para 22 to the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and decide the matter. It would be appropriate to extract the same which reads as hereunder: \"22. Jurisdiction: The plaintiff states that the defendants having their office at Vadodara land which is the subject-matter of the instant suit is situated within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon' ble Court and hence h this Hon'ble Court has the jurisdiction to hear and decide the matter.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In that background, a perusal of the prayer made in the plaint would essentially indicate that the suit is one seeking for specific performance of the terms of MoU whereunder it is agreed that the mortgage deed be executed.

Be that as it may, the learned Senior Advocates on both sides have sought to rely on the legal position decided by the various High Courts in the absence of the pronouncement of this Court. The learned Senior Advocate in that regard have referred to the various decisions on the same point. However, we do not find it appropriate to refer to each of them and over burden this order d since we notice that the High Court in fact has referred to various decisions while deciding the instant case and has thereafter arrived at its conclusion. The discussion as made by the High Court with reference to the various decisions is also justified. In that view, we would refer to the decision of a Division Bench in Jagmohan Behl v. State Bank of Indore 2 relied on by the learned Senior Advocate for the appellant. In that regard, it is noticed that in the said case on e taking note of the provision contained in Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the CC Act, 2015 it is held that the dispute involved therein would constitute a commercial dispute and the expression \"arising out of' and \"in relation to immovable property\" should not be given the narrow and restricted meaning and the expression would include all matters relating agreements in connection with the immovable properties. The said conclusion reached was in a circumstance f where the immovable property in question was undoubtedly being used for a trade or commerce and it was held so when the claim in the suit is for recovery of rent or mesne profit, security deposit, etc. for the use of such immovable property. 11. On the other hand, the learned Senior Advocate for the respondents has relied on the decision of a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in Vasu 9 Healthcare (P) Ltd. v. Gujarat Akruti TCG Biotech Ltd. 3 wherein a detailed consideration has been made and the conclusion reached therein by taking note of an earlier decision is that on a plain reading of Section 2(1)(c) of the CC Act, 2015 the expression \"used\" must mean \"actually used\" or \"being used\". 2 2017 SCC OnLine Del 10706 3 2017 SCC OnLine Guj 724 : AIR 2017 Guj 153 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiff has candidly admitted and/or conceded that the case shall not fall within Sections 2(c)(i); 2(c)(ii) or 2(c)(xx) of the Commercial Courts Act. It is required to be noted that before the learned Commercial Court it was never the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that the case would fall within Section 2(c)(vii) of the learned Commercial Court. Despite the above we have considered on merits whether even considering Section 2(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the dispute between the parties can be said to be \"commercial dispute\" within the definition of Section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act or not? Considering Section 2(c)(vii), \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out of the agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. As observed hereinabove, at the time of filing of the suit and even so pleaded in the plaint, the immovable property/plots the agreements between the parties cannot be said to be agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. As per the agreement between the party after getting the plots on lease from the GIDC, the same was required to be thereafter developed by the original Defendant 1 and after providing all infrastructural facilities and sub-plotting it, the same is required to be given to other persons like the original plaintiff. It is the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as the original Defendant 1 has failed to provide any infrastructural facilities and develop the plots and therefore, a civil suit for specific performance of the agreement has been filed. There are other alternative prayers also. Therefore, it cannot be said that the agreement is as such relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce. It is the case on behalf of the original plaintiff that as in clause (vii) of Section 2(c), the phraseology used is not \"actually used\" or \"being used\" and therefore, even if at present the plot is not used and even if it is likely to be used even in future, in that case also, Section 2(c)(vii) shall be applicable and therefore, the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction. The aforesaid has no substance. As per the cardinal principle of law while interpreting a particular statute or the provision, the literal and strict interpretation has to be applied. It may be noted that important words used in the relevant provisions are \"immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce\".

On plain reading of the relevant clause it is clear that the expression \"used\" must mean \"actually used\" or \"being used\". If the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the phraseology used would have been different as for example, \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". The word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be said to be either \"ready for use\" or \"likely to be used\"; or \"to be used\". Similar view has been taken by the Bombay High Court (N agpur Bench) in Dineshkumar Gulabchand Agrawal4 and it is observed and held that the word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and not merely \"ready for use\". It is reported that SLP against the said decision has been dismissed5 by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\" (emphasis in original) 12. Though we are informed that the said decision is assailed before this Court in a special leave petition we are inclined to agree with the view expressed therein. This is for the reason that this Court while examining the issue relating to exclusive land use, though in the different context has laid emphasis on the present user of the land either for agriculture or non-agriculture purpose being relevant. In that regard, the decision relied on by the learned Senior Advocate for the respondent in Federation of A.P. Chambers of Commerce & Industry v. State of A.P. 6 is noticed, wherein it is observed as under: (SCC pp. 552-53, paras 6 & 9) \"6. Section 3 of the said Act speaks of \"land is used for any industrial purpose\", \"land is used for any commercial purpose\" and \"land is used for any other non-agricultural purpose\". The emphasis is on the words \"is used\". For the purposes of levy of assessment on non-agricultural lands at the rate specified in the Schedule for land used for industrial purposes, therefore, there has to be a finding as a fact that the land is in fact in praesenti in use for an industrial purpose. The same would apply to a commercial purpose or any other non-agricultural purpose. * * * 9. We are in no doubt whatever, therefore, that it is only land which is actually in use for an industrial purpose as defined in the said Act that can be assessed to non-agricultural assessment at the rate specified for land used for industrial purposes. The wider meaning given to the word \"used\" in the judgment under challenge is untenable. Having regard to the fact that the said Act is a taxing statute, no court is justified in imputing to the legislature an intention that it has not clearly expressed in the language it has employed.\" (emphasis supplied) 13. The learned Senior Advocate for the appellant would however, contend that a strict interpretation as in the case of taxing statutes would not be appropriate in the instant case where the issue relates to jurisdiction.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h AMBALAL SARABHAI ENTERPRISES LTD. v. 595 K.S. INFRASPACELLP (Banumathi, J.) regard, the learned Senior Advocate has referred to the Statement of Objects and Reasons with which the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 is enacted so as to provide speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes so as to create the positive image to the investors world about the independent and responsive Indian legal system. Hence, he contends that a purposive interpretation be made. It is contended that a wider purport and meaning is to be assigned while entertaining the suit and considering the dispute to be a commercial dispute. Having taken note of the submission we feel that the very purpose for which the CC Act of2015 has been enacted would be defeated if every other suit merely because it is filed before the Commercial Court is entertained . This is for the reason that the suits which are not actually relating to commercial dispute but being filed merely because of the high value and with the intention of seeking early disposal would only clog the system and block the way for the genuine commercial disputes which may have to be entertained by the Commercial Courts as intended by the lawmakers. In commercial disputes as defined a special procedure is provided for a class of litigation and a strict procedure will have to be followed to entertain only that class of litigation in that jurisdiction. If the same is strictly interpreted it is not as if those excluded will be non- suited without any remedy. The excluded class of litigation will in any event be entertained in the ordinary civil courts wherein the remedy has always existed. 14. In that view it is also necessary to carefully examine and entertain only disputes which actually answers the definition \"commercial disputes\" as provided under the Act. In the instant case, as already taken note neither the agreement between the parties refers to the nature of the immovable property being exclusively used for trade or commerce as on the date of the agreement nor is there any pleading to that effect in the plaint. Further the very relief sought in the suit is for execution of the mortgage deed which is in the nature of specific performance of the terms of Memorandum of Understanding without reference to nature of the use of the immovable property in trade or commerce as on the date of the suit. Therefore, if all these aspects are kept in view, we are of the opinion that in the present facts the High Court was justified in its conclusion arrived through the order dated 1-3-2019 1 impugned herein. The Commercial Court shall therefore return the plaint indicating a date for its presentation before the Court having jurisdiction. 15. Accordingly, the instant appeal being devoid of merit stands dismissed, with no order as to costs. R. BANUMATHI, J. (concurring)- I have gone through the judgment of my esteemed Brother A.S. Bopanna, J. I am in full agreement with the conclusion that in order to fall within Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act, the immovable property must be \"used exclusively\" or \"being used exclusively\" in trade or commerce.

The Act is deemed to have come into force w.e.f. 23-10-2015. Act No. 4 of2016 was amended by Central Act 28 of 2018, the Commercial Courts Act. 18. We may refer to the Law Commission's 253rd Report, which inter alia made various recommendations. Para 4.2 of Chapter IV-\"Conclusions and Summary of Recommendations\" of the Law Commission's 253rd Report reads as under: \"4.2. The Commercial Courts, the Commercial Divisions and the Commercial Appellate Divisions of High Courts that have been recommended are intended to serve as a pilot project in the larger goal of reforming the civil justice system in India. The goal is to ensure that cases are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant. Not only does this benefit the litigant, other potential litigants (especially those engaged in trade and commerce) are also advantaged by the reduction in backlog caused by the quick resolution of commercial disputes. In turn, this will further economic growth, increase foreign investment, and make India an attractive place to do business. Further, it also benefits the economy as a whole given that a robust dispute resolution mechanism is a sine qua non for the all-round development of an economy.\"7 After the Law Commission's 253rd Report, Act No. 4 of 2016 was amended by Central Act 28 of 2018. 19. Section 3 of the Act deals with constitution of Commercial Courts. As per Section 3 of the Act, the State Government shall, after consultation with the High Court, by notification, constitute Commercial Courts at district level if deemed necessary for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction under the Act. As per Section 3(1-A) of the Act, Commercial Courts shall have jurisdiction to try the commercial disputes of a \"specified value\" which shall not be less than three lakh rupees or such higher value, for whole or part of the State, as it may consider necessary.

INFRASPACELLP (Banumathi, J.) and not hampered by the usual procedural delays plaguing our traditional legal system. 37. A dispute relating to immovable property per se may not be a commercial dispute. But it becomes a commercial dispute, if it falls under sub-clause (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act viz. \"the agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce\". The words \"used exclusively in trade or commerce\" are to be interpreted purposefully. The word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be either \"ready for use\" or \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". It should be \"actually used\". Such a wide interpretation would defeat the objects of the Act and the fast tracking procedure discussed above. 38. On 3-11-2017, a Memorandum of Understanding was executed between the appellant-plaintiff, respondent-defendant and Ketan Bhailalbhai Shah, second respondent. As per the terms of Mo U, parties executed a deed of conveyance of the land. A mortgage deed was executed simultaneously along with the Mo U with respect to the part of the land admeasuring 15,000 sq ft in favour of the plaintiff. It was understood between the parties that Respondent 1 would apply for change of land use permission for the land in question on signing of the MoU. Mortgage deed was executed by Respondent 1 in favour of the appellant in order to ensure performance of obligations under the Mo U. But the said mortgage deed was not presented for registration. 39. It appears that the trial court has proceeded under the footing that the parties to the suit more particularly, the appellant-plaintiff seems to be carrying on business as estate agent and to manage land, building, etc. and the very object as enumerated in Memorandum and Articles of Association of the appellant-plaintiff company established that the property in question is being used exclusive! y in trade or commerce rather in the business of the plaintiff. As rightly pointed out by the High Court, there is nothing on record to show that at the time when agreement to sell came to be executed in 2012, the property was being exclusively used in trade and commerce so as to bring dispute within the ambit of sub-clause (vii) of Section 2(1)(c) of the Act. Merely because, the property is likely to be used in relation to trade and commerce, the same cannot be the ground to attract the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court. 40. In Ujwala Raje Gaekwar v. Hemaben Achyut Shah 8 , Special Civil Suit No. 533 of 2011 was instituted for declaration that the sale deed valued at Rs 17.76 crores executed by the appellant-original Defendant 1 in favour of Respondent 4 be declared illegal and also, for permanent injunction with respect to the land in question. The appellants-defendants thereon filed an application that in sale deed, it has been clearly mentioned that the agreement relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce and falls within the meaning of Section 2(1)(c)(vii) of the Commercial Courts Act and that the matters above, the value of rupees one crore are to be transferred to the Commercial Court.

The Gujarat High Court held that the aim, object and purpose of establishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that the cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, and if such a suit which is as such arising out of the probate proceedings and/or is dispute with respect to the property are transferred to the Commercial Division/Commercial Court, there shall not be any difference between the regular civil courts and the Commercial Division/Commercial Courts and the object for the establishment of the Commercial Division/Commercial Courts shall be frustrated. 41. In Vasu Healthcare (P) Ltd. v. Gujarat Akruti TCG Biotech Ltd. 3 , referred to in extenso by my learned Brother, it was held that: (SCC OnLine Guj para 33) \"33 . ... On plain reading of the relevant clause, it is clear that the expression \"used\" must mean \"actually used\" or \"being used\". If the intention of the legislature was to expand the scope, in that case the phraseology used would have been different as for example, \"likely to be used\" or \"to be used\". The word \"used\" denotes \"actually used\" and it cannot be said to be either \"ready for use\" or \"likely to be used\"; or \"to be used\".\" We entirely agree with the above purposive interpretation adopted by the Gujarat High Court. 42. The object and purpose of the establishment of Commercial Courts, Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions of the High Court is to ensure that the cases involved in commercial disputes are disposed of expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigants. Keeping in view the object and purpose of the establishment of the Commercial Courts and fast tracking procedure provided under the Act, the statutory provisions of the Act and the words incorporated thereon are to be meaningfully interpreted for quick disposal of commercial litigations so as to benefit the litigants especially those who are engaged in trade and commerce which in turn will further economic growth of the country.
