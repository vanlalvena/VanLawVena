He made complaint against the local police to the District Superintendent of b Police and forwarded a copy of the same to the Director General of Police but nothing concrete happened. On account of these complaints, 'S', the then Police Inspector Nadiad, became annoyed with the Chief Judicial Magistrate and withdrew constables posted in the CJM Court. When 'P' directed the police to drop the criminal cases against certain persons who had caused obstruction c in judicial proceedings on their tendering unqualified apology, 'S' reacted strongly to the direction and made complaint against the CJM to the Registrar of the High Court through District Superintendent of Police. On September 25, 1989, 'S' met the CJM in his chambers to discuss a case where the police had failed to submit charge-sheet within 90 days. During discussion 'S' invited the CJM to visit the police station to see the papers and further assured that his d visit would mollify the sentiments of the police officials. Accordingly, at about 8.40 p.m. 'S' sent a police jeep at the residence of 'P' and on that vehicle 'P' went to the police station. When he arrived in the chamber of 'S' in the police station he was forced to consume liquor and on his refusal he was assaulted. He was handcuffed and tied up with a thick rope by the Police Inspector, a Sub- e Inspector, a Head Constable and a Constable. This was deliberately done in defiance of Police Regulations and Circulars issued by the Gujarat Government and the law declared by Supreme Court in Prem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi Administration, (1980) 3 sec 526. A panchnama showing the drunken state of 'P' was prepared on the dictation of 'S' and was signed by 'S' as well as two pan- chas - a Mamlatdar and a Fire Brigade Officer. Thereafter, 'P' was taken to f Civil Hospital handcuffed and tied with thick rope where he was deliberately made to sit outside in the verandah on a bench for half an hour to enable the public to have a full view of the CJM in that condition. A press photographer was brought on the scene and the policemen posed with 'P' for the press photograph. The photographs so taken were published in newspapers. A g belated justification for this was pleaded by the police that 'P' desired to have himself photographed in that condition. A request made by 'P' in the casualty ward of the Civil Hospital, to the doctors to contact the District Judge and inform him about the incident was not allowed by 'S' and other police officers. On examination at the hospital, the body of 'P' was found to have a number of injuries. His blood was taken and chemical examination conducted without fol- h lowing the procedure prescribed by the Rules and the Circulars issued by the Director of Medical Services, Gujarat. The Chemical Examiner submitted the report holding that the blood sample of 'P' contained alcohol on the basis of the calculation made by him in the report, though he later clearly admitted that he had never determined the quantity of liquor by making calculation in any ; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

At the initial stage only one case was registered against 'P' by the police under the Bombay Prohibition Act, but when lawyers met 'S' for securing release of 'P' on bail, the offence being bailable, 'S' registered another case under Sections 332 and 506 IPC in order to frustrate the attempt to get 'P' released as offence under Section 332 is non-bailable. The then District Super- intendent of Police did not take any immediate action in the matter; instead he created an alibi for himself alleging that he had gone elsewhere and stayed in a Government Rest House there. The register at the Rest House indicating the entry regarding his stay was found to have been manipulated subsequently by making interpolation. All these facts were found established by a then sitting Judge of Allahabad High Coun who was appointed as Commissioner by the Supreme Coun to hold inquiry and submit repon after the Coun took oog- nizance of the matter and issued notices to the State of Gujarat and other police officers pursuant to the writ petitions under Article 32 filed and telegrams sent to the Coun from all over the country by Bar Councils, Bar Associations and individuals for saving the dignity and honour of the judiciary. Two basic questions arose before the Supreme Coun: (1) Whether the incident constituted contempt of coun? (2) Whether Supreme Court has inherent juris- diction or power to punish for contempt of subordinate or inferior courts under Article 129 and whether the inherent jurisdiction and power of the Supreme Court is restricted by the Act? Disposing of the writ petitions, contempt peti- tions and criminal miscellaneous petitions the Supreme Coun Held: (1) The definition of criminal contempt is wide enough to include any act by a person which would tend to interfere with the administration of justice or which would lower the authority of court. The public have a vital stake in effec- tive and orderly administration of justice. The Coun has the duty of protecting the interest of the community in the due administration of justice and, so, it is entrusted with the power to commit for contempt of coun. not to protect the dignity of the Court against insult or injury, but, to protect and vindicate the right of the public so that the administration of justice is not pervened, prejudiced, obstructed or interfered with. The power to punish for contempt is thus for the protection of public justice, whose interest requires that decency and decorum is preserved in Courts of Justice. Those who have to discharge duty in a Coun of Justice are protected by the law, and shielded in the discharge of their duties. Any deliberate interference with the discharge of such duties either in court or outside the coun by attacking the presiding officers of the court, would amount to criminal contempt and the courts must take serious cognizance of such conduct. (Paras 42 and 43) In this case the CJM was assaulted, arrested, handcuffed and tied with a thick rope around his arms and body by the police officers as if he was a wild animal. He was taken in that condition to the hospital for medical examination where he was made to sit in the verandah exposing him to the public gaze, providing opportunity to the members of the public to see that the police had the power and privilege to apprehend and deal with a Chief Judicial Magistrate according to its sweet will.

Its effect was not confined to one District or State, it had a tendency to effect the entire judiciary in the country. The incident highlights a dangerous trend that if the police is annoyed with the orders of a presiding officer of a coun, he would be arrested on flimsy manufactured charges, to humiliate him publicly as has been done in the instant case. The conduct of police officers in assaulting and humiliating the CJM brought the authority and administration of justice into disrespect, affecting the public confidence in the institution of justice. The Chief Judicial Magistrate is head of the Magistracy in the district who administers justice to ensure, protect and safeguard the rights of citizens. The subordinate courts at the district level cater to the need of the masses in administering justice at the base level. By and large the majority of the people get their disputes adjudicated in subordinate courts. It is therefore, in the general interest of the community that the authority of subordinate courts is protected. If the CJM is led into trap by unscrupulous police officers and if he is assaulted, handcuffed and roped, the public is bound to lose faith in courts, which would be destructive of basic structure of an ordered society. If this is permitted Rule of Law shall be supplanted by Police Raj. (Paras 40 and 43) Prem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi Administration, (1980) 3 SCC 526: 1980 SCC (Cri) 815; Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, (1978) 4 SCC 494: 1979 SCC (Cri) 155, relied on He/more v. Smith, (1886) 35 Ch D 436: (1886) 31 Sol Jo 60; Offutt v. U.S., (1954) 348 US 11: 99 L Ed 11; Attorney General v. Times Newspapers, (1974) AC 273: (1973) 3 All ER 54, refe\"ed to Therefore, 'S', the Police Inspector, who had pre-planned the entire scheme, the SI, the Head Constable and the Constable who had taken active part in this shameful episode with a view to malign and denigrate the CJM on account of his judicial orders against the police were guilty of contempt of court. The Mamlatdar was also in complicity with 'S' and he having actively participated in the preparation of the document to malign and humiliate the CJM and to prepare a false case against him, is also guilty of contempt of court. Besides, the then District Superintendent of Police did not discharge his duty like a responsible police officer; instead he identified hlmself with the Police Inspector and actively abetted the commission of onslaught on the CJM. There- fore, he was also guilty of contempt of court. (Paras 45 and 46) In determining the punishment, the degree and the extent of part played by each of the contemners has to be kept in mind. The Police Inspector, who had planned the entire episode, being the main culprit, deserves the maximum punishment. He shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months and he shall pay fine of Rs 2000. The Sub-Inspector, who took active pan in assaulting and tying the CJM at the behest of the Inspector, shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of five months and pay a fine of Rs 2000 and in default he shall undergo one month's simple imprisonment.

STATE OF GUJARAT 411 months and a fine of Rs 500 each, in default they would undergo simple imprisonment for a further period of 15 days. The Mamlatdar who was friendly to the Inspector but had no axe to grind against the CJM and acted under the influence of the Inspector, is, convicted and awarded two months' simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1000 and in default he would undergo one month's simple imprisonment. The then District Superintendent of Police, who had actively abetted the commission of the onslaught on the CJM, is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of one month and to pay a fine of Rs 1000 and in default to undergo simple imprisonm~nt for 15 days. So far as other respondents, against whom notices of contempt have been issued by the Court, are concerned there is no adequate material on record to hold them guilty of contempt of court. Accordingly, notice issued to them are discharged. However, the then D.G., Police was totally indifferent to the news that a CJM was arrested, handcuffed, roped and assaulted. He took this news as a routine matter without taking any steps to ascertain the correct facts or effective action against the erring police officers. If the head of the police administration in the State exhibits such indifference to a sensitive matter which shook the entire judicial machinery in the State, nothing better could be expected from his sub- ordinate officers. He did not act like a responsible officer. The State Govern- ment should take action against him departmentally on the basis of the findings recorded by the Commission. Discharge of contempt notices does not absolve these officers of their misconduct. The State Government is directed to proceed with the disciplinary proceedings for taking appropriate action against them. (Paras 52 and 53) It is hoped that the State Government will take effective measures to avoid reoccurrence of any such instance. The State Government should further take immediate steps for the review and revision of the Police Regulations in the light of the findings recorded by the Commission. However, the following guidelines are laid down which should be followed in case of arrest and deten- tion of a Judicial Officer : (A) A Judicial Officer should be arrested for any offence under intimation to District Judge or the High Court as the case may be. (B) In case of necessity for immediate arrest of a Judicial Officer only a technical or formal arrest may be effected. (C) The fact of such arrest should be immediately communicated to the District and Sessions Judge of the concerned District and the Chief Justice of the High Court. (D) The Judicial Officer so arrested shall not be taken to a police station, without the prior order or directions of the District and Sessions Judge of the concerned district, if available. (E) Immediate facilities shall be provided to the Judicial Officer for com- munication with his family members, legal advisers and Judicial Officers, including the District and Sessions Judge.

(G) Ordinarily there should be no handcuffing of a Judicial Officer. a The above guidelines are not exhaustive but these are minimum safeguards which must be observed in case of arrest of a Judicial Officer. These guidelines should be implemented by the State Government as well as by the High Courts. (Paras 54, 55 and 56) Further, no Judicial Officer should visit a Police Station on his own except in connection with his official and judicial duties and functions. If it is necessary for a Judicial Officer or a Subordinate Judicial Officer to visit the Police Sta- tion in connection with his official duties, he must do so with prior intimation of his visit to the District and Sessions Judge. (Para 57) (2) Since the Supreme Court has power of judicial superintendence and control over all the courts and tribunals functioning in the entire territory of the country. It has a corresponding duty to protect and safeguard the interest of inferior courts to ensure the flow of the stream of justice in the courts without any interference or attack from any quarter. The subordinate and inferior courts do not have adequate power under the law to protect themselves. There- fore, it is necessary that the Supreme Court should protect them. Under the constitutional scheme the Supreme Court has a special role in the administra- tion of justice. The powers conferred on it under Articles 32, 136, 141 and 142 form part of basic structure of the Constitution. The amplitude of the power of the Court under these articles of the Constitution cannot be curtailed by law made by Central or State legislature. Though High Courts have power to persist for the contempt of subordinate courts but that does not affect or abridge the inherent power of the Supreme Court under Article 129. The Supreme Court and the High Court both exercise concurrent jurisdiction under the constitu- tional scheme in matters relating to fundamental rights under Articles 32 and 226. Therefore the Supreme Court's jurisdiction and power to take action for contempt of subordinate courts would not be inconsistent to any constitutional scheme. The Apex Court is duty bound to take effective steps within the con- stitutional provisions to ensure a free and fair administration of justice throughout the country. For that purpose it must wield the requisite power to take action for contempt of subordinate courts. Ordinarily, the High Court would protect the subordinate court from any onslaught on their independence, but in exceptional cases, such as when attack on judges or Magistrates of sub- ordinate courts may have wide repercussions throughout the country, extra- ordinary situation may prevail affecting the administration of public justice or where the entire judiciary is affected, the Supreme Court may directly take cog- nizance of contempt of subordinate courts. However, Court will sparingly exercise its inherent power in taking cognizance of the contempt of subordinate courts, as ordinarily matters relating to contempt of subordinate courts must be dealt with by the High Courts.

It may entertain any appeal by granting special leave against any order made by any Magistrate, tribunal on any other subordinate court. The width and amplitude of the power is not affected by the practice and procedure followed by the Supreme Court in insisting that before invoking the jurisdiction of the Court under Article 136, the aggrieved party must exhaust remedy available under the law before the appellate authority or the High Court. Self-imposed restrictions by the Supreme Court do not divest it of its wide powers to entertain any appeal against any order or judgment passed by any court or tribunal in the country without exhausting alternative remedy before the appellate authority or the High Court. In view of the expression \"notwithstanding anything in this Chap- ter\" occurring in Article 136 the power of the Supreme Court thereunder is unaffected by Articles 132, 133, 134 and 134-A. (Para 15) The Supreme Court has wide power to interfere and correct the judgment and orders passed by any court or tribunal in the country. In addition to the appellate power, the Court has special residuary power to entertain appeal against any order of any court in the country. The plenary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to grant leave and hear appeals against any order of a court or tribunal, confers power of judicial superintendence over all the courts and tribunals in the territory of India including subordinate courts of Magistrate and District Judge. The Supreme Court has, therefore, supervisory jurisdiction over all courts in India. (Paras 18 and 31) Durga Shankar Mehta v.

The Supreme Court's jurisdiction under Article 129 is confined to the contempt of itself only and it has no jurisdiction to indict a person for contempt of an inferior court subordinate to the High Court. It was urged that even if the Supreme Court is a court of record, it has no power to take action for the con- tempt of a Chief Judicial Magistrate's court as neither the Constitution nor any statutory provision confers any such jurisdiction or power on the Supreme Court. It was further urged that so far as the High Court is concerned, it has power of judicial and administrative superintendence over the subordinate courts and further Section 15 of the Act expressly confers power on the High Court to take action for the contempt of subordinate courts. The Supreme Court being a court of record has limited jurisdiction to take action for con- tempt of itself under Article 129; it has no jurisdiction to indict a person for the contempt of subordinate or inferior courts. Rejecting the contentions Ht!ld: Both the Supreme Court as well as High Courts are courts of record. The Constitution does not define \"Court of. Record\", but this expression is well recognised in juridical world. A Court of Record is \"a court whereof the acts and judicial proceedings are enrolled for a perpetual memorial and testimony\" and has power of summarily punishing contempt of itself as well as of sub- ordinate courts.

This view does not run counter to any provision of the Constitution. (Paras 31 and 38) Article 227 confers supervisory jurisdiction on the High Court and in exercise of that power High Court may correct judicial orders of subordinate courts. In addition to that, the High Court has administrative control over the subordinate courts. Supreme Court's power to correct judicial orders of the subordinate courts under Article 136 is much wider and more effective than that contained under Article 227. Absence of administrative power of super- intendence over the High Court and subordinate court does not affect the Supreme Court's wide power of judicial superintendence of all courts in India. Once there is power of judicial superintendence, all the courts whose orders are amenable to correction by the Supreme Court would be subordinate courts and therefore, the Supreme Court also possesses similar inherent power as the High Court has under Article 215 with regard to the contempt of subordinate courts. The jurisdiction and power of a superior Court of Record to punish contempt of subordinate courts was not founded on the Court's administrative power of superintendence; instead the inherent jurisdiction was conceded to superior Court of Record on the premise of its judicial power to correct the errors of subordinate courts. (Para 31) While courts constituted under a law enacted by the Parliament or the State legislature have limited jurisdiction and they cannot assume jurisdiction in a matter, not expressly assigned to them, that is not so in the case of a super- ior court of record constituted by the Constitution. Such a court does not have a limited jurisdiction; instead it has power to determine its own jurisdiction. No matter is beyond the jurisdiction of a superior court of record unless it is expressly shown to be so under the provisions of the Constitution. In the absence of any express provision in the Constitution the Apex Court being a court of record has jurisdiction in every matter and if there be any doubt, the Court has power to determine its jurisdiction. If such determination is made by High Court, the same would be subject to appeal to the Supreme Court, but if the jurisdiction is determined by the Supreme Court it would be final.

Jai Narain, (1986) 1 sec 75, relied on Inherent powers of a superior Court of Record have remained unaffected even after codification of Contempt Law. There is no provision in the Con- tempt of Courts Act, 1971 curtailing the Supreme Court's power with regard to contempt of subordinate courts. Section 15 of the Act prescribes modes for taking cognizance of criminal contempt by the High Court and Supreme Court. It is not a substantive provision conferring power or jurisdiction on the High Court or on the Supreme Court for taking action for the contempt of its sub- ordinate courts. The whole object of prescribing procedural modes of taking cognizance in Section 15 is to safeguard the valuable time of the High Court and the Supreme Court being wasted by frivolous complaints of contempt of court.

The Parliament is thus competent to enact a law relating to the powers of Supreme Court with regard to 'contempt of itself; such a law may prescribe procedure to be followed and it may also prescribe the maximum punishment which could be awarded and it may provide for appeal and for other matters. But the Central legislature has no legislative competence to abridge or extinguish the jurisdiction or power conferred on this Court under e Article 129. The Parliament's power to legislate in relation to law of contempt relating to Supreme Court is limited. Therefore the Act does not impinge upon this Court's power with regard to the contempt of subordinate courts under Article 129 (Para 28) Constitution of India - Article 129 - 'Including the power to punish for f contempt of itself - Word 'including' - Interpretation of - Indicates Supreme Court has power to punish for contempt of itself as well as sub- ordinate courts -Words and Phrases Interpretation of the Constitution - Construction rendering any expres- sion of the provision superftuous or redundant not acceptable Held: The expression \"including the power to punish for contempt of itself' used in Article 129 is not restrictive, instead it is extensive in nature. The expression \"including\" extends and widens the scope of power. The plain language of Article 129 clearly indicates that the Supreme Court as a Court of Record has power to punish for contempt of itself and also something else which could fall within the inherent jurisdiction of a court of record. In inter- preting the Constitution, it is not permissible to adopt a construction which would render any expression superfluous or redundant. The courts ought not to accept any such construction.

Since the Supreme Court is designed by the Constitution as a Court of Record and as the Founding Fathers were aware that a superior court of record had inherent power to indict a person for the contempt of itself as well as of courts inferior to it, the expression \"including\" was deliberately inserted in the article. Article 129 recogniSed the existing inherent power of a court of record in its full plenitude including the power to punish for the con- tempt of inferior courts. If Article 129 is susceptible of two interpretations, the interpretation which would preserve the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court being the superior Court of Record has to be accepted, to safeguard and protect the subordinate judiciary, which forms the very backbone of administra- tion of justice. Toe subordinate courts administer justice at the grassroot level. Their protection is necessary to preserve the confidence of people in the efficacy of courts and to ensure unsullied flow of justice at its base level. (Para 29) Constitution of India - Article 129 - Inherent power of Supreme Court under, to punish for contempt of itself as well as subordinate courts not affected by conferment of appellate power under Section 19 of Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 Disputing the inherent power of the Supreme Court with regard to the contempt of subordinate courts it was contended that inherent powers are always preserved, but they do not authorise a court to invest itself with jurisdic- tion when that jurisdiction is not conferred by law. It was urged that the status of an appellate court like High Court, does not enable the High Court to claim original jurisdiction not vested by law. Similarly, the Supreme Court having appellant jurisdiction under Section 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, cannot invest itself with original jurisdiction for contempt of subordinate courts. Rejecting the contention Held: Where jurisdiction is conferred on a court by a statute, the extent of juris- diction is limited to the extent prescribed under the statute. But there is no such limitation on a superior court of record in matters relating to the exercise of constitutional powers. The conferment of appellate power on the Supreme Court under Section 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act does not and cannot affect the width and amplitude of its inherent powers under Article 129.

It was urged that once a criminal case is registered against a person the law requires that the court should allow the case to proceed to its normal conclusion and there should be no interference with the process of trial. Rejecting the contention Held: Article 142(1) provides that Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any 'cause' or 'matter' pending before it. The expression 'cause' or 'matter' would include any proceeding pending in court and it would cover almost every kind of proceeding in court including civil or criminal. Though there is no provision like Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code confer- ring express power on the Supreme Court to quash or set aside any criminal proceedings pending before a criminal court to prevent abuse of process of the court, but the inherent power of the Court under Article 142 coupled with the plenary and residuary powers under Articles 32 and 136 embraces power to quash criminal proceedings pending before any court to do complete justice in the matter before the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court is satisfied that the proceedings in a criminal case are being utilised for oblique purposes or if the same are continued on manufactured and false evidence or if no case is made out on the admitted facts, it would meet the ends of justice to set aside or quash the criminal proceedings. Once the Supreme Court is satisfied that the criminal proceedings amount ~o abuse of process of court it would quash such proceed- ings to ensure justice. It is idle to suggest that in such a situation the Supreme Court should be a helpless spectator. (Paras 50 and 49) -'fhe Supreme Court's power under Article 142(1) to do \"complete justice\" is entirely of different level and of a different quality. What would be the need of \"complete justice\" in a cause or matter would depend upon the facts and cir- cumstances of each case and while exercising that power the Court would take into consideration the express provisions of a substantive statute. Any prohibi- tion or restriction contained in ordinary laws cannot act as a limitation on the constitutional power of the Supreme Court. Once the Supreme Court has seisin of a cause or matter before it, it has power to issue any order or direction to do \"complete justice\" in the matter. This constitutional power of the Apex Court cannot be limited or restricted by provisions contained in statutory law. No enactment made by Central or State legislature can limit or restrict the power of the Supreme Court under Article 142, though while exercising power under Article 142, the Supreme Court must take into consideration the statutory provisions regulating the matter in dispute. (Para 51) Since the foundation of the criminal trial of the CJM is based on the facts which have already been found to be false, it would be in the interest of justice and also to do complete justice in the cause to quash the criminal proceed- ings.

Any finding recorded on the basis of their evidence is violative of Article 20(3). Rejecting the contention Held: In order to avail the protection of Article 20(3) three conditions must be satisfied. Firstly, the person must be accused of an offence. Secondly, the ele- ment of compulsion to be a witness should be there and thirdly it must be against himself. All the three ingredients must necessarily exist before protec- tion of Article 20(3) is available. If any of these ingredients do not exist, Article 20(3) cannot be invoked (Para 12) Balkishan A. Devidayal v. Staie of Mahorashlra, (1980) 4 sec 600: 1981 sec (Cri) 62, relied on Mere issue of notice or pendency of contempt proceedings do not attract Article 20(3) as the contemners against whom notices were issued were not accused of any offence. A criminal contempt is punishable by the superior courts by fine or imprisonm~nt, but it has many characteristics which dis- tinguishes it from ordinary offence. Since, the contempt proceeditlgs are not in the nature of criminal proceedin~ for an offence, the pendency of contempt proceedings cannot be regarded as criminal proceedings merely because it may end in imposing punishment on the contemner. A contemner is not in the posi- tion of an accused. It is open to the court to cross-examine the contemner and even if the contemner is found to be guilty of contempt, the court may accept apology and discharge the notice of contempt, whereas tendering of apology is no defence to the trial of a criminal offence.

In a criminal trial where a person is accused of an offence there is a public prosecutor who prosecutes the case on behalf of the prosecution against the accused but in contempt proceed- a ings the court is both the accuser as well as the judge of the accusation. Con- tempt proceeding is sui generis. In this view the contemners do not stand in the position of a \"person accused of an offence\" merely on account of issue of notice of contempt by this Court and the Commission which was acting on behalf of this Court had full authority to record the testimony of the con- temners.

There are marked differences in the constitution and jurisdiction and the amplitude of powers exercised by the two courts. In addition to ci~l and criminal appellate jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has wide powers under Article 136 over all the courts and tribunals in the country. The Federal Court had no such power; instead it had appellate power but that too could be exercised only on a certificate issued by the High Court. The Fed- eral Court was a court of record under Section 203 but it did not possess any plenary or residuary appellate power over all the courts functioning in the ter- ritory of India like the power conferred on the Supreme Court under Article 136. Therefore, the Federal Court had no judicial control or superintendence over subordinate courts. (Para 35) Advent of freedom, and promulgation of Constitution have made drastic changes in the administration of justice necessitating new judicial approach. The Constitution has assigned a new role to the Constitutional Courts to ensure rule of law in the country. These changes have brought new perceptions. In interpreting the Constitution, regard must be had to the social, economic and political changes, need of the community and the independence of judiciary. The court cannot be a helpless spectator, bound by precedents of colonial days which have lost relevance.

SINGH, J.- On September 25, 1989, a horrendous incident took place in the town of Nadiad, District Kheda in the State of Gujarat, a which exhibited the berserk behaviour of police undermining the dignity and independence of judiciary. S.R. Sharma, Inspector of Police, with 25 years of service posted at the Police Station, Nadiad, arrested, assaulted and handcuffed N.L Patel, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nadiad and tied him with a thick rope like an animal and made a public exhibition of it by b sending him in the same condition to the hospital for medical examina- tion on an alleged charge of having consumed liquor in breach of the prohibition law enforced in the State of GujaraL The Inspector S.R. Sharma got the Chief Judicial Magistrate photographed in handcuffs with rope tied around his body along with the constables which were c published in the newspapers all over the country. This led to tremors in the Bench and the Bar throughout the whole country. 2. The incident undermined the djgnity of courts in the country, Judicial Officers, Judges and Magistrates all over the country were in a d state of shock, they felt insecure and humiliated and it appeared that instead of Rule of Law there was Police Raj in Gujarat. A number of Bar Associations passed Resolutions and went on strike. The Delhi Judicial Service Association, the All India Judges Association, Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh, Judicial Service of Gujarat and many others approached e the Apex Court by means of telegrams and petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for saving the dignity and honour of the judiciary. On September 29, 1989, this Court took cognizance of the mat- ter by issuing notices to the State of Gujarat and other police officers. The Court appealed to the members of the Bar and Judiciary to resume f work to avoid inconvenience to the litigant public. Subsequently, a num- ber of petitions were filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for taking action against the police officers and also for quashing the criminal proceedings initiated by the police against N.L. Patel, Chief Judicial Magistrate. A number of Bar Associations, Bar Councils and g individuals appeared as interveners condemning the action of the police and urging the Court for taking action against the police officers. 3.

No. 517 of 1989 with a prayer to quash the two FIRs lodged against him, to direct the trial of the complaint filed by him as State case a and to award compensation. 4. On February 13, 1990 notices for contempt were issued to K. Dadabhoy, ex-DGP, Gujarat, Dr Bhavsar, Senior Medical Officer of Government Hospital Nadiad and M.B. Savant, Mamlatdar, Nadiad. The Court during the proceedings also issued notices to R. Bala Krishnan, b Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Government of Gujarat and S.S. Sudhalkar, District Judge, Nadiad to show cause why action be not taken against them in view of the Report of Justice Sahai. 5. N.L. Patel was posted as Chief Judicial Magistrate at Nadiad in c October, 1988. He soon found that the local police was not co-operating with the courts in effecting service of summons, warrants and notices on accused persons, as a result of which the trials of cases were delayed. He made complaint against the local police to the District Superintendent of Police and forwarded a copy of the same to the Director General of d Police but nothing concrete happened. On account of these complaints S.R. Sharma, Police Inspector Nadiad was annoyed with the Chief Judi- cial Magistrate, he withdrew constables posted in the CJM Court. In April 1989 Patel fiJed two complaints with the police against Sharma and other police officials, Nadiad for delaying the process of the court. On e July 25, 1989 Patel directed the police to register a criminal case against 14 persons who had caused obstruction in judicial proceedings but sub- sequently since they tendered unqualified apology, the CJM directed the Police Inspector to drop the cases against those persons. Sharma reacted strongly to Patel's direction and he made complaint against the CJM to f the Registrar of the High Court through District Superintendent of Police. These facts show that there was hostility between the Police of Nadiad and the CJM. On September 25, 1989, S.R. Sharma met Patel, CJM in his chambers to discuss the case of one Jitu Sport where the police had failed to submit charge-sheet within 90 days. During discus- g sion Sharma invited the CJM to visit the police station to see the papers and further his visit would mollify the sentiments of the police officials. It is alleged that at 8.35 p.m. Sharma sent a police jeep at Patel's residence, and on that vehicle Patel went to the Police Station. What actually hap- pened at the Police Station is a matter of serious dispute between the 1 parties. According to the CJM, he arrived in the chamber of Sharma in the Police Station, he was forced to consume liquor and on his refusal he was assaulted, handcuffed and tied with rope by Sharma, Police Inspector, Sadia, Sub-Inspector, Valjibhai Kalabhai, Head Constable and Pratap Singh, Constable.

Sharma, Police Inspector and other police officers have disputed these allegations. According to Sharma, Patel entered his chamber at the Police Station at a 8.45 p.m. on September 25, 1989 in a drunken state, shouting and abus- ing him, he caught hold of Sharma and slapped him, since he was violent be was arrested, handcuffed and sent to hospital for medical examina- tion. Patel himself wanted to be photographed while he was handcuffed and tied with ropes, a photographer was arranged to take his photograph b which was published in the newspapers. 6. Since there was serious dispute between the parties with regard to the entire incident, the Court appointed Justice R.M. Sahai senior puisne Judge of the Allahabad High Court (as he then was) to inquire into the incident and to submit report to the Court. Justice Sahai was c appointed to hold the inquiry on behalf of this Court and not under the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry Act. Justice Sahai visited Nadiad and held sittings there. The learned Commissioner/Judge invited affidavits/statements, and examined witnesses including S.R. Sharma the Police Inspector, DJ(. Dhagal, DSP and other police officers, lawyers, d N.L. Patel, CJM, and doctors and other witnesses. Justice Sahai afforded full opportunity to all the concerned persons including the State Govern- ment, police officers and lawyers to lead evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. He submitted a detailed Report dated November 28, 1989 to this Court on December 1, 1989. On receipt of the Report this Court e directed copies to be delivered to concerned parties and permitted the parties and the contemners to file their objections, if any, before this Court. The objections were filed by the police officers and the con- temners disputing the findings recorded by the Commissioner. f 7. On December 12, 1989, when the matter came up for final dis- posal the Court issued notices to the Attorney General and Advocate General of the State of Gujarat. On January 10, 1990 the Court directed the State of Gujarat to file affidavit stating as to what action it had taken or proposed to take against the officers in the light of the Report of g Justice Sahai. The Court further issued notices to R. Bala Krishnan, Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Government of Gujarat, K. Dadab- hoy, Director General of Police, S.S.

In his affidavit, S.R. Sharma, Police Inspector has raised a number of objections to the findings recorded by the Commissioner. The objec- tions are technical in nature, challenging the authority and jurisdiction of the Commissioner in collecting evidence and recording findings agaimt him. Sharma has further stated in his objections that the Commissioner b acted as if he was sitting in judgment over the case. Other police officers have also raised similar objections. We find no merit in the objections raised on behalf of Sharma, Police Inspector and other contemners. The Commissioner had been appointed by this Court to hold inquiry and sub- mit his report to the Court. Justice Sahai was acting on behalf of this c Court and he had full authority to record evidence and cross-examine witnesses and to collect evidence on behalf of this Court. Since the main incident of Chief Judicial Magistrate's arrest, assault, handcuffing and roping was connected with several other incidents which led to the con- d frontation between the Magistracy and local police, the learned Com- missioner was justified in recording his findings on the background and genesis of the entire episode. The Police Inspector Sharma raised a grievance that he was denied opportunity of cross-examination of Patel, CJM and he was not permitted to produce Dr Jhala as a witness. Shanna's application for the recall of CJM for further cross-examination e and for permission to produce Dr Jhala, retired Deputy Director, Medi- cal and Health Services, Gujarat, was rejected by a well reasoned order of the Commissioner dated November 9, 1989. We have gone through the order and we find that the Commissioner has given good reasons for f rejecting the recall of CJM for further cross-examination, as he had been cross-examined by the counsel appearing on behalf of the police officials including Shanna. The police officers and the State Government and CJM were represented by counsel before the Commissioner and every opportunity was afforded to them for cross-examining the witn~. Dr Jhala's evidence was not necessary, the Commissioner rightly refused g Shanna's prayer. 9. On behalf of the contemners it was urged that in the absence of any independent testimony the Commission was not justified in accepting· interested version of the incident as given by the CJM with regard to his h visit to the Police Station and the incident which took place inside the Police Station. There was oath against oath and in the absence of any independent testimony the Commission was not justified in accepting the sole interested testimony of Patel, CJM. We find no merit in this objec- tion.

This fact is supported by indepen- dent witnesses as discussed by the Commissioner. If Patel had gone on a the invitation of Sharma in police jeep and not in the manner as alleged by Shanna, Patel could not be drunk and there appears no reason as to why he would have assaulted Sharma as alleged by t.he police. The cir- cumstances as pointed out by the Commissioner fully justify the findings recorded against the police officers. It is settled law that even in a b criminal trial, accused is convicted on circumstantial evidence in the absence of an eye-witness. Learned Commissioner acted judicially in a fair and objective manner in holding the inquiry, he afforded opportunity to the affected police officers and other persons and submitted his Report based on good reasons in respect of his findings which are amply c supported by the material on record. The Commissioner did a com- mendable job in a record time. After hearing arguments at length and on perusal of the statements recorded by the Commissioner and the docu- mentary evidence submitted by the parties, and a careful scrutiny of the affidavits and objections filed in this Court, we find no valid ground to d reject the well reasoned findings recorded by the learned Commissioner. The Commissioner's Report runs into 140 pages, which is on record. The contemners and other respondents have failed to place any convincing material before the Court to take a different view. We accordingly accept the same. e 10. After hearing learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the affidavits, objections, applications and the Report of the Com- missioner, we hold that the following facts and circumstances are fully proved: (1) N.L. Patel, Chief Judicial Magistrate found that the Police of Nadiad was not effective in service of summons and it had adopted an attitude of indifference to court orders. He tried to obtain the assistance of the District Superintendent of Police in February 1989 and addressed a letter to the Director General f g of Police but no response came from the Police Authorities, even though the government had reminded D.K Dhagal, DSP, Kheda to do the needful. Patel, the CJM filed two complaints against police officers of N adiad Police Station and the Inspectors, and forwarded it to the District Superintendent of Police on July 19 and 24, 1989 for taking action against them. h Sharma. the Police Inspector who had by then been posted at Nadiad reacted to the CJM's conduct by withdrawing con- stables working in the courts of Magistrates on the alleged pretext of utilising their services for service of summons.

On July 25, 1989, the CJM had directed the registration of a case against 14 accused persons for misbehaviour and causing obstruction in the judicial proceedings. Since the accused per- sons had later expressed regret and tendered unqualified apol- ogy to the court, the CJM sent a letter to the Police Inspector, Sharma to drop proceedings. Shanna went out of his way, to send a complaint to the High Court through the DSP saying that Patel was functioning in an illegal manner in the judicial discharge of his duties. The action of Sharma, Police Inspector was highly irresponsible and Dhagal, DSP should not have acted in a casual manner in forwarding Sharma ·s letter to the Registrar of the High Court directly. Remand period of Jitu Sport was to expire on September 27, 1989, -the CJM directed the Police Inspector to produce com- plete papers before the expiry of the period of remand but he applied for the extension of the judicial remand. The CJM directed the Police Inspector to produce papers on September 22, 1989, Sharma did not appear before the CJM as directed, on the contrary he interpolated the order sent to him, indicating that he was required to appear before the CJM on September 23, 1989, which was admittedly a holiday. On September 25, 1989, Sharma met the CJM in his chamber and as a pretext requested him to come to the Police Station to see the papers which could not be brought to the Court, as that could satisfy him that the police was doing the needful for com- plying with the orders of the Court. Sharma pleaded with CJM that his visit to Police Station wiU remove the feeling of con- frontation between the Police and Magistracy. The CJM agreed to visit the Police Station and Sharma offered to send police jeep to CJM's house for bringing him to the Police Station. On September 25, 1989 after the Court hours the CJM went to the officers' club where he remained in the company of Sud- halkar, District Judge and Pande, Civil Judge till 8.30 p.m. Thereafter, he went to his residence. A police jeep came to his residence at about 8.40 p.m. in the Officers Colony, he went in that police jeep to the Police Station situate at a distance of about 2 kms. Patel had not consumed liquor before he went to the Police Station. The police version that Patel had consumed liquor before com- ing to the Police Station and that he assaulted the Police Inspector Sharma and misbehaved with him at the Police Sta- tion is a cooked up story.

Patel was hand- cuffed and tied with rope, and he received injuries at the Police a Station, he was assaulted and forced to consume liquor after he was tied to the chair on which he was sitting, Police Inspector Shanna, Sub-Inspector Sadia, Head Constable Valjibhai Kalab- hai and Constable Pratap Singh took active part in this episode. They actively participated in the assault on Patel and in forcing b liquor in his mouth. They acted in collusion with Shanna to humiliate and teach a lesson to Patel. (7) On the direction of Sharma, Police Inspector, Patel was hand- cuffed at the Police Station and he was further tied up with a thick rope by the Police Inspector, Sharma, Sadia, Sub- Inspector, Valjibhai Kalabhai, Head Constable and Pratap c Singh, Constable. This was deliberately done in defiance of Police Regulations and Circulars issued by the Gujarat Govern- ment and the law declared by this Court in Prem Shanka.r Shukla v. Delhi Administration 1• Patel had not committed any offence nor he was violent and yet he was handcuffed and tied d up with rope without there being any justification for the same. There were seven police personnel present at the Police Sta- tion and most of them were fully armed while Patel was empty handed, there was absolutely no chance of Patel escaping from the custody or making any attempt to commit suicide or attack- e ing the Police Officers and yet he was handcuffed and tied up with a thick rope like an animal with a view to humiliate and teach him a lesson. For this wanton act there was absolutely no justification and pleas raised by Sharma that Patel was violent or that he would have escaped from the custody are a figment f of imagination made for the purpose of the case.

Barot, Fire Brigade Officer, Nadiad, did not represent the correct facts, instead, it was manufactured for the purpose of g preparing a false case against CJM Patel, justifying his arrest and detention. On examination at the Civil Hospital Patel's body was found to have a number of injuries. The injury on the left eye was very clear which appeared to have been caused by external force. His body had bruises and abrasions which could be caused by fists and blows. While in the casualty ward of the Civil Hospital, Patel requested the doctors to contact the District Judge and inform him about the incident.

Dr Parashar and Dr Bhavsar found the speech of Patel normal, gait steady, he was neither violent, nor he misbehaved. His blood was taken for chemical examination but the Forms used were not accord- ing to the rules and the blood was not taken in accordance with procedure prescribed by the Rules and the Circulars issued by the Director of Medical Services, Gujarat. The chemical exam- ination of the blood sample taken in the Civil Hospital was not correctly done. The blood sample was analysed by a teenager who was not a testing officer within the Bombay Prohibition Act and necessary precautions at the time of analysis were not taken. The phial in which the blood sample had been sent to the Chemical Examiner did not contain the seal on phial and the seal was not fully legible. The Chemical Examiner who sub- mitted the report holding that the blood sample of Patel con- tained alcohol on the basis of the calculation made by him in the report clearly admitted before the Commission that he had never determined the quantity of liquor by making calculation in any other case and Patel's case was his first case. 10) When Patel was taken to Civil Hospital handcuffed and tied with thick rope he was deliberately made to sit outside in the veranda on bench for half an hour in public gaze, to enable the public to have a full view of the CJM in that condition. A press photographer was brought on the scene and the policemen posed with Patel for the press photograph. The photographs were taken by the press reporter without any objection by the police, although a belated justification was pleaded by the police that Patel desired to have himself photographed in that condition. This plea is totally false. The photographs taken by the press reporter were published in 'Jan Satta' and 'Lokmat' on September 26, 1989 showing Patel handcuffed and tied with rope and the policemen standing beside him. This was deliberately arranged by Sharma to show to the public that police wielded real power and if the CJM took confrontation with police he will not be spared . 11) At the initial stage, one case was registered against Patel by the police under the Bombay Prohibition Act. Two Advocates Kantawala and Brahmbhatt met Sharma at 11.30 p.m. for secur- ing Patel's release on hail, as offences under the Prohibition Act were bailable.

Dhagal, the then District Superintendent of Police, Kheda a exhibited total indifference to CJM's complaint regarding the unsatisfactory state of affairs in the matter of execution of court processes. Dhagal identified himself with Sharma, Police Inspector who appeared to be his favourite. Instead of taking corrective measures in the service of processes, he became b party along with Sharma in forwarding his complaint to the High Court against Patel's order in a judicial matter. The inci- dent which took place in the night of September 25/26, 1989, had the blessing of Dhagal He did not take any immediate action in the matter instead he created an alibi for himself alleg- ing that he had gone to Lasundara and then to Balasinor Police c Station and stayed there in a Government Rest House. The register at the Rest House indicating the entry regarding his stay was manipulated subsequently by making interpolation. On the direction of Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Dhagal submitted his report on September 27, 1989 but in that report d he did not make any reference of handcuffing and roping of the CJM although it was a matter of common knowledge and there was a great resentment among the judicial officers and\\he local public. Dhagal's complicity in the sordid episode is further fortified by the fact that he permitted Sharma, the main culprit e of the entire episode to carry on investigation against Patel in the case registered against him by Sharma and also in the case registered by Patel against Sharma. (13) Police Inspector Sharma had pre-planned the entire incident and he had even arranged witnesses in advance for preparing f false case against N.L Patel, CJM, as M.B.

STATE OF GUJARAT (Singh, J.) 431 ment by ref erring to the details of the findings as the same are contained in the Commissioner's Report. 12. Mr Nariman contended on behalf of the police officers that the findings recorded by the Commission cannot be taken into account as those findings arc hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution. Inspector Sharma and other police officers against whom criminal cases have been registered were compelled to be witnesses against themselves by filing affidavits and by subjecting them to cross-examination before the Com- missioner. Any finding recorded on the basis of their evidence is violative of Article 20(3) of the Constitution. Article 20(3) of the Constitution declares that no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. In order to avail the protection of Article 20(3) three conditions must be satisfied. Firstly, the person must be accused of an offence. Secondly, the element of compulsion to be a witness should he there and thirdly it must be against himself. All the three ingredients must necessarily exist before protection of Article 20(3) is available. If any of these ingredients do not exist, Article 20(3) cannot be invoked sec: Balkishan A. Devidayal v. State of Maharashtra 2• In the instant case this Court had issued notices for contempt to Sharma, Police Inspector and other contemners. Mere issue of notice or pendency of contempt proceedings do not attract Article 20(3) of the Constitution as the con- temncrs against whom notices were issued were not accused of any offence. A criminal contempt is punishable by the superior courts by fine or imprisonment, but it has many characteristics which distinguishes it from ordinary offence. An offence under the criminal jurisdiction is trial by a Magistrate or a Judge and the procedure of trial is regulated by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 which provides an elaborate procedure for framing of charges, recording of evidence, cross- cxamination, argument and the judgment. But charge of contempt is tried on summary process without any fixed procedure as the court is free to evolve its own procedure consistent with fair play and natural justice. In contempt proceedings unlike the trial for a criminal offence no oral evidence is ordinarily recorded and the usual practice is to give evidence by affidavits. Under the English law a criminal offence is tried by criminal courts with the aid of jury but a criminal contempt is tried by courts sum- marily without the aid and assistance of jury. Ordinarily, process of trial for contempt is summary. A summary form of trial is held in the case of civil contempt and also in the case of criminal contempt where the act is committed in the actual view of the court or by an officer of justice. The summary procedure is applicable by immemorial usage when criminal contempt was committed out of court by a stranger.

We do not consider it necessary to refer to decisions from English courts which have been discussed in detail in the History of Contempt of Court by Fox J. C. (1927). Proceedings for contempt of court are not taken in the exercise of original criminal jurisdiction. Proceedings for contempt of court are of a peculiar nature; though it b may be that in certain aspects they are quasi-criminal, but in any view they are not exercised as part of the original criminal jurisdiction of the court, as was held in Tushar Kanti Ghosh, Re3. The High Court held that since the proceedings for contempt of court do not fall within the original criminal jurisdiction of the Court no leave could be granted for c appeal to Privy Council under clause 41 of the letters patent of that Court. 13. In Sukhdev Singh Sodhi v. Chief Justice and Judges of the PEPSU High Court4, Sukhdev Singh Sodhi approached this Court for transfer of contempt proceedings from PEPSU High Court to any other High Court d under Section 527 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. This Court rejected the application holding that Section 527 of the Criminal Procedure Code did not apply to the contempt proceedings as the con- tempt jurisdiction is a special jurisdiction which is inherent in all courts of record and the CrPC excludes such a special jurisdiction from the Code. e The Court further held that notwithstanding the provisions contained in the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926 making an offence of contempt punishable, the Act does not confer any jurisdiction or create the offence, it merely limits the amount of the punishment which could be awarded and it removes a certain doubt. The jurisdiction to initiate the proceedings and take seisin of the contempt is inherent in a court of record and the procedures of the Criminal Procedure Code do not apply f to contempt proceedings. Section 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down that nothing contained in this Code shall, in the absence of the g specific provision to the contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in force, or any special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being in force.

A con- temner is not in the position of an accused, it is open to the court to a cross-examine the contemner and even if the contemner is found to be guilty of contempt, the court may accept apology and discharge the notice of contempt, whereas tendering of apology is no defence to the trial of a criminal offence. This peculiar feature distinguishes contempt proceedings from criminal proceedings. In a criminal trial where a person b is accused of an offence there is a public prosecutor who prosecutes the case on behalf of the prosecution against the accused but in contempt proceedings the court is both the accuser as well as the judge of the accusation as observed by Hidayatullah, C.J. in Debabrata Bandopadhyay case5. Contempt proceeding is sui generis, it has peculiar features which c are not found in criminal proceedings. In this view the contemners do not stand in the position of a \"person accused of an offence\" merely on account of issue of notice of contempt by this Court and the Commission which was acting on behalf of this Court had full authority to record the testimony of the contemners. Commission issued notice and directed d Sharma, Police Inspector and other police officials to place their version of the incident before it and there was no element of compulsion. In this view there has been no violation of Article 20(3) of the Constitution and Commission's findings are not vitiated. e 14. Mr F.S. Nariman contended that this Court has no jurisdiction or power to indict the police officers even if they are found to be guilty as their conduct does not amount to contempt of this Court. He urged that Articles 129 and 215 demarcate the respective areas of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts respectively. This Court's jurisdic- f tion under Article 129 is confined to the contempt of itself only and it has no jurisdiction to indict a person for contempt of an inferior court subordinate to the High Court. The Parliament in exercise of its legisla- tive power under Entry 77 of List I read with Entry 14 of List Ill has enacted Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (hereinafter referred to as the g 'Act') and that Act does not confer any jurisdiction on this Court for taking action for contempt of subordinate courts. Instead the original jurisdiction of High Courts in respect of contempt of subordinate courts is specificaJJy preserved by Sections 11 and 15(2) of the Act. The Supreme Court has C--ily a!')pellate powers under Section 19 of the Act h read with Articles 134(1)(c) and 136 of the Constitution. The constitu- tional and statutory provisions confer exclusive power on the High Court for taking action with regard to contempt of inferior or subordinate court, and the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction in the matter.

Shri Soli J. Sorab- a jee learned Attorney General (as he then was) urged that power to punish contempt is a special jurisdiction which is inherent in a court of record. A superior court of record has inherent power to punish for con- tempt of itself and it necessarily includes and carries with it the power to punish for contempt committed in respect of subordinate or inferior b courts. A superior court of record having power to correct the order of inferior court has power to protect that court by punishing those who interfere with the due administration of justice of that court. Articles 129 and 215 do not confer any additional jurisdiction on the Supreme Court and the High Court. The constitutional provisions as well as the legisla- c tive enactment \"The Contempt of Courts Act\" recognise and preserve the existing contempt jurisdiction and power of the court of record for punishing for contempt of subordinate or inferior courts. The Act has not affected or restricted the suo moto inherent power of the Supreme Court being a court of record which has received constitutional sanction d under Article 129. Mr Sorabjee further urged that even otherwise the Act does not restrict or affect the suo moto exercise of power by the Supreme Court as a court of record in view of Section 15(1) of Act. The Supreme Court as the Apex Court is the protector and guardian of justice throughout the land, therefore, it has a right and also a duty to e protect the courts whose orders and judgments are amenable to correc- tion, from commission of contempt against them. This right and duty of the Apex Court is not abrogated merely because the High Court also has this right and duty of protection of the subordinate courts. The jurisdic- tions are concurrent and not exclusive or antagonistic. f 15. The rival contentions raise the basic question whether the Supreme Court has inherent jurisdiction or power to punish for con- tempt of subordinate or inferior courts under Article 129 of the Con- stitution and whether the inherent jurisdiction and power of this Court is g restricted by the Act. The answer to the first question depends upon the nature and the scope of the power of this Court as a court of record, in the background of the original and appellate jurisdiction exercised by this Court under the various provisions of the Constitution. It is necessary to have a look at the constitutional provisions relating to the original and h appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Article 124 lays down that there shall be a Supreme Court of India consisting of Chief Justice of India and other Judges. Article 32 confers original jurisdiction on this Court for enforcement of fundamental rights of the citizens.

Article 129 provides that the Supreme Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court includ- a ing the power to punish for contempt of itself. Article 131 confers original jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in certain matters. Article 132 confers appellate jurisdiction on this Court against any judgment, decree or final order of the High Courts in India. Articles 133, 134 and 134-A confer appellate jurisdiction in the Supreme Court in appeals from High b ·Courts in regard to civil and criminal matters respectively on certificate to be issued by the High Court. Article 136 provides for special leave to appeal before the Supreme Court, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 132, 133, 134 and 134-A Article 136 vests this Court with wide powers to &rant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, c determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India except a court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces. The Court's appellate power under ArticJe 136 is plenary, it may entertain any appeal by 1ranting special leave against any order made by any d Magistrate, tribunal on any other subordinate court. The width and amplitude of the power is not affected by the practice and procedure fol- lowed by this Court in insisting that hefore invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution, the aggrieved party must exhaust remedy available under the law before the appellate e authority or the Hi&h Court. Self-imposed restrictions by this Court do not divest it of its wide powers to entertain any appeal against any order or jud1ment passed by any court or tribunal in the country without exhausting alternative remedy before the appellate authority or the High Court. The power of this Court under Article 136 is unaffected by Arti- f cles 132, 133, 134 and 134-A in view of the expression \"notwithstanding anything in this Chapter\" occurring in Article 136. 16.

P.S.R Sadhanantham 1 this Court entertained a an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution of India by special leave at the instance of a complainant against the judgment and the order of acquittal in a murder case and on appraisal of evidence, it set aside the order of acquittal. Objections raised on behalf of the accused relating to the maintainability of the special leave petition under Article 136 of the Constitution, were rejected. Chinnappa Reddy, J. speaking for the Court held as under: (SCC p. 300, para 4) b \"Article 136 of the Constitution of India invests the Supreme Court with a plenitude of plenary, appellant power over all courts c and tribunals in India. The power is plenary in the sense that there are no words in Article 136 itself qualifying that power. But, the very nature of the power has led the Court to set limits to itself within which to exercise such power. It is now the well established practice of this Court to permit the invocation of the power under Article d 136 only in very exceptional circumstances, as when a question of law of general public importance arises or a decision shocks the con- science of the Court. But, within the restrictions imposed by itself, this Court has the undoubted power to interfere even with findings of fact, making no distinction between judgments of acquittal and e conviction, if the High Court, in arriving at those findings, has acted 'perversely or otherwise improperly'.\" With regard to the competence of a private party, distinguished from the State, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution, the Court observed: (SCC pp. 300-01, para 5) f \"Appellate power vested in the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution is not to be confused with ordinary appellate power exercised by appellate courts and appellate tribunals under specific statutes. As we said earlier, it is a plenary power, 'exercisable outside the purview of ordinary law' to meet the press- ing demands of justice (vide Durga Shankar Mehta v. Thakur Raghuraj Singh'). Article 136 of the Constitution neither confers on anyone the right to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court g nor inhibits anyone from invoking the Court's jurisdiction. The power is vested in the Supreme Court but the right to invoke the Court's jurisdiction is vested in no one.

There is therefore no room for any doubt that this Court has wide power to interfere and correct the judgment and orders p~ed by any court or tribunal in the country. In addition to the appellate power, the Court has special residuary power to entertain appeal against any order of any court in the country. The plenary jurisdiction of this Court to grant leave and hear appeals against any order of a court or tribunal, confers power of judicial superintendence over all the courts and tribunals in the territory of India including subordinate courts of Magistrate and District Judge. This Court has, therefore, supervisory jurisdiction over all courts in India. 19. Article 129 provides that the Supreme Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself. Article 215 contains similar provision in respect of High Court. Both the Supreme Court as well as High Courts are courts of record having powers to punish for contempt including the power to punish for contempt of itself. The Constitution does not de:fine \"Court of Record\". This expression is well recognised in juridical world. In Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law, \"Court of Record\" is defined as: \"A court whereof the acts and judicial proceedings are enrolled for a perpetual memorial and testimony, and which has power to fine and imprison for contempt of its authority.\" In Wharton's Law Lexicon, Court of Record is defined as: \"Courts are either of record where their acts and judicial proceedings are enrolled for a perpetual memorial and testimony and they have power to fine and imprison; or not of record being courts of inferior dignity, and in a less proper sense the King's Courts - and these are not entrusted by law with any power to fine or imprison the subject of the realm, unless by the express provision of some Act of Parliament. These proceedings are not enrolled or recorded.\" In Words and Phrases (Permanent Edition Vol. 10 page 429) \"Court of Record\" is defined as under: \"Court of Record is a court where acts and judicial proceedings are enrolled in parchment for a perpetual memorial and testimony, which rolls are called the 'record' of the court, and are of such high and supereminent authority that their truth is not to be questioned.\" Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Ecfn., Vol. 10, para 709, page 319, states: \"Another manner of division is into courts of record and courts not of record.

The proceedings of a court of record a preserved in its archives are called records, and are conclusive evi- dence of that which is recorded therein.\" 20. In England a superior court of record has been exercising power to indict a person for the contempt of its authority and also for the con- tempt of its subordinate and inferior courts in a summary manner b without the aid and assistance of jury. This power was conceded as a necessary attribute of a superior court of record under Anglo-Saxon System of Jurisprudence. The concept of inherent power of the superior court of record to indict a person by summary procedure was considered in detail in Rex v. Almon\" commonly known as Almon case. In that case c King's Bench initiated proceedings for contempt against John Almon, a book-seller for publishing a libel on the Chief Justice, Lord Mansfield. On behalf of the contemner objection was taken to the summary procedure followed by the court. After lengthy arguments judgment was prepared by Chief Justice Wilmot holding that a libel on a Judge was d punishable by the process of attachment without the intervention of a jury, as the summary form of procedure was founded upon immemorial usage. The judgment prepared with great learning and erudition could not be delivered as the proceedings were dropped following the change of government. After long interval Wilmot's judgment was published in e 1802. The judgment proceeded on the assumption that the superior Common Law Courts did have the power to indict a person for contempt of court, by following a summary procedure on the principle that this power was 'a necessary incident co every court of justice'. Undelivered judgment of Wilmot, J. has been subject of great controversy in England f and Sir John Fox has severely criticised Almon case8, in his celebrated book The History of Contempt of Court: The Form of Trial and Mode of Punishment. In spite of serious criticism of the judgment of Wilmot, J. the opinion expressed by him has aH along been followed by the English and Commonwealth Courts. In Ramy v. Justices of Sein-a Leone', on an g application for leave to appeal against the order of the Court of Seirra Leone for contempt of court, the Privy Council upheld the order on the ground that the Court of Seirra Leone being a Court of Record was the sole and exclusive judge of what amounted to contempt of court. h 21. In India, the courts have followed the English practice in holding that a court of record has power of summarily punishing contempt of itself as well as of subordinate courts.

STATE OF GUJARAT (Singh, J.) 439 Justice and Judges of the High Court at Fort William in Benga/ 10, the High Court of Calcutta in 1883 convicted Surendranath Banerjea, who was Editor and Proprietor of weekly newspaper for contempt of court and sentenced him to imprisonment for two months for publishing libel reflecting upon a Judge in his judicial capacity. On appeal the Privy Council upheld the order of the High Court and observed that the High Courts in Indian Presidencies were superior courts of record, and the powers of the High Court as superior courts in India are the same as in England. The Privy Council further held that by common law every court of record was the sole and exclusive judge of what amounts to a con- tempt of court. In Sukhdev Singh Sodhi case• this Court considered the origin, history and development of the concept of inherent jurisdiction of a court of record in India. The Court after considering Privy Council and High Courts' decisions held that the High Court being a court of record has inherent power to punish for contempt of subordinate courts. The Court further held that even after the codification of the law of contempt in India the High Court's jurisdiction as a court of record to initiate proceedings and take seisin of the matter remained unaffected by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926. 22. Mr Nariman contended that even if the Supreme Court is a court of record, it has no power to take action for the contempt of a Chief Judicial Magistrate's court as neither the Constitution nor any statutory provision confers any such jurisdiction or power on this Court. He further urged that so far as the High Court is concerned, it has power of judicial and administrative superintendence over the subordinate courts and further Section 15 of the Act expressly confers power on the High Court to take action for the contempt of subordinate courts. This Court being a court of record has limited jurisdiction to take action for contempt of itself under Article 129 of the Constitution; it has no juris- diction to indict a person for the contempt of subordinate or inferior courts. 23. The question whether in the absence of any express provision a Court of Record has inherent power in respect of contempt of subordin- ate or inferior courts, has been considered by English and Indian courts. We would briefly refer to some of those decisions. In the leading case of Rex v. Parke 11,Wills, J. observed: (KB p. 442) \"This Court exercises a vigilant watch over the proceedings of inferior courts, and successfully prevents them from usurping powers which they do not possess, or otherwise acting contrary to Jaw.

Davies 12 Wills, J. further heJd that the King's Bench being a a court of record must protect the inferior courts from unauthorised inter- ference, and this could only be secured by action of the King's Bench as the inferior courts have no power to protect themselves and for that pur- pose this power is vested in the superior court of record. Since the King's Bench is the custos morum of the kingdom it must apply to it with the b necessary adaptations to the altered circumstances of the present day to uphold the independence of the judiciary. The principle )aid down in Rex v. Davies 12 was foHowed in King v. Editor of the Daily Mai/ 13 where it was held that the High Court as a court of record has inherent jurisdiction to punish for contempt of a court martial which was an inferior court. c Avory, J. observed: (KB p. 752) '\"The result of that judgment (Rex v. Davies 12) is to show that wherever and whenever this Court has power to correct an inferior court, it also has power to protect that court by punishing those who interfere with due administration of justice in that court.·• d In Attorney General v. British Broadcasting Co,pn. 14 the House of Lords proceeded on the assumption that a court of record possesses protective jurisdiction to indict a person for interference with the administration of justice in the inferior courts but it refused to indict as it held that this e protection is available to a court exercising judicial power of the State and not to a tribunal even though the same may be inferior to the court of record. These authorities show that in England the power of the High Court to deal with the contempt of inferior court was based not so much on its historical foundation but on the High Court's inherent jurisdiction f being a court of record having jurisdiction to correct the orders of those courts. 24. In India prior to the enactment of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926, High Court's jurisdiction in respect of contempt of subordinate and inferior courts was regulated by the principles of Common Law of Eng- g land. The High Courts in the absence of statutory provision exercised power of contempt to protect the subordinate courts on the premise of inherent power of a Court of record.

The Par- liamentary legislation did not confer any new or fresh power or jurisdic- c tion on the High Courts in respect of contempt of courts subordinate to it, instead it reaffirmed the inherent power of a Court of Record, having same jurisdiction, power and authority as it has been exercising prior to the enactments. The effect of these statutory provisions was considered by this Court in Sukhdev Singh Sodhi case4, and the Court held that con- d tempt jurisdiction was a special one inherent in the very nature of a court of record and that jurisdiction and power remained unaffected even after the enactment of 1926 Act as it did not confer any new jurisdiction or create any offence, it merely limited the amount of punishment which could be awarded to a contemner. The jurisdiction of the High Court to e initiate proceedings or taking action for contempt of its subordinate courts remained as it was prior to the 1926 Act. In RL. Kapur v. State of T.N.n the Court again emphasised that in view of Article 215 of the Con- stitution, the High Court as a court of record possesses inherent power and jurisdiction, which is a special one, not arising or derived from Con- f tempt of Courts Act and the provisions of Section 3 of 1926 Act, do not affect that power or confer a new power or jurisdiction. The Court fur- ther held that in view of Article 215 of the Constitution, no law made by a legislature could take away the jurisdiction conferred on the High Court nor it could confer it afresh by virtue of its own authority. g 26. The English and the Indian authorities are based on the basic foundation of inherent ·power of a Court of Record, having jurisdiction to correct the judicial orders of subordinate courts. The King's Bench in England and High Courts in India being superior Courts of Record and h having judicial power to correct orders of subordinate courts enjoyed the inherent power of contempt to protect the subordinate courts.

STAIB OF GUJARAT (Singh, J.) 443 possess and exercise similar jurisdiction and power as the High Courts had prior to Contempt Legislation in 1926. Inherent powers of a superior a Court of Record have remained unaffected even after codification of Contempt Law. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 was enacted to define and limit the powers of courts in punishing contempts of courts and to regulate their procedure in relation thereto. Section 2 of the Act defines contempt of court including criminal contempt. Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 b and 9 specify matters which do not amount to contempt and the defence which may be taken. Section 10 relates to the power of High Court lo punish for contempt of subordinate courts. Section 10 like Section 2 of 1926 Act and Section 3 of 1952 Act reiterates and reaffirms the jurisdic- tion and power of a High Court in respect of its own contempt and of c subordinate courts. The Act does not confer any new jurisdiction instead it reaffirms the High Court's power and jurisdiction for taking action for the contempt of itself as weU as of its subordinate courts. We have scanned the provisions of the 1971 Act, but we find no provision therein curtailing the Supreme Court's power with regard to contempt of sub- d ordinate courts, Section 15 on the other hand expressly refers to this Court's power for taking action for contempt of subordinate courts. Mr Nariman contended that under Section 15 Parliament has exclusively conferred power on the High Court to punish for the contempt of sub- ordinate courts. The legislative intent being clear, this Court has no 8 power under its inherent jurisdiction or as a court of record under Arti- cle 129 of the Constitution with regard to contempt of subordinate courts. Section 15 of the Act reads as under: f g h i \"15. Cognizance of criminal contempt in other cases.- (1) In the case of a criminal contempt, other than a contempt referred to in Section 14, the Supreme Court or the High Court may take action on its own motion or a motion made by- ( a) the Advocate General, or (b) any other person, with the consent in writing of the Advo- cate General, or ( c) in relation to the High Court for the Union territory of Delhi, such Law Officer as the Central Government may by notification in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf, or any other person, with the consent in writing of such Law Officer.

Under sub-section (1) the Supreme Court and High Court both have power to take cognizance of criminal contempt and it provides three modes for taking cognizance. The Supreme Court and the High Court both may take cognizance on its own motion or on the motion d made by the Advocate General or any other person with the consent in writing of the Advocate General. Sub-section (2) provides that in case of any criminal contempt of subordinate court, the High Court may take action on a reference made to it by the subordinate court or on a motion made by the Advocate General, and in, relation to a Union territory, on a e motion made by any officer as may be specified by the government. Thus Section 15 prescribes modes for taking cognizance of criminal contempt by the High Court and Supreme Court, it is not a substantive provision conferring power or jurisdiction on the High Court or on the Supreme Court for taking action for the contempt of its subordinate courts. The f whole object of prescribing procedural rflodes of taking cognizance in Section 15 is to safeguard the valuable time of the High Court and the Supreme Court being wasted by frivolous complaints of contempt of court. Section 15(2) does not restrict the power of the High Court to take cognizance of the contempt of itself or of a subordinate court on its g own motion although apparently the section does not say so. In S.K Sarkar, Member, Board of Revenue, U.P. Lucknow v. Vmay Chandra Misra24 this Court held that Section 15 prescribed procedure for taking cognizance and it does not affect the High Court's suo moto power to take cognizance and punish for contempt of subordinate courts. h 28.

Entry 77 of List I states: \"Constitution, organisation, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court (including contempt of such court), and the fees taken therein; persons entitled to practise before the Supreme Court.\" This entry read with Article 246 confers power on the Parliament to enact law with respect to the constitution, organisation, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court including the contempt of this Court. The ParUament is thus competent to enact a law relating to the powers of Supreme Court with regard to 'contempt of itself; such a law may prescribe procedure to be followed and it may also prescribe the maximum punishment which could be awarded and it may provide for appeal and for other matters. But the Central legislature has no legislative competence to abridge or extinguish the jurisdiction or power conferred on this Court under Article 129 of the Constitution. The Parliament's power to legislate in relation to law of contempt relat- ing to Supreme Court is limited, therefore the Act does not impinge upon this Court's power with regard to the contempt of subordinate courts under Article 129 of the Constitution. 29. Article 129 declares the Supreme Court a court of record and it further provides that the Supreme Court shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself ( emphasis supplied). Tne expression used in Article 129 is not restrictive instead it is extensive in nature. If the Framers of the Constitution intended that the Supreme Court shall have power to punish for contempt of itself only, there was no necessity for inserting the expression \"including the power to punish for contempt of itself'. The article confers power on the Supreme Court to punish for contempt of itself and in addition, it con- fers some additional power relating to contempt as would appear from the expression \"including\". The expression \"including\" has been inter- preted by courts, to extend and widen the scope of power. The plain language of Article 129 clearly indicates that this Court as a court of record has power to punish for contempt of itself and also something else which could fall within the inherent jurisdiction of a court of record. In interpreting the Constitution, it is not permissible to adopt a construc- tion which would render any expression superfluous or redundant. The courts ought not to accept any such construction. While construing Arti- cle 129, it is not permissible to ignore the significance and impact of the inclusive power conferred on the Supreme Court. Since the Supreme Court is designed by the Constitution as a court of record and as the Founding Fathers were aware that a superior court of record had inherent power to indict a person for the contempt of itself as well as of courts inferior to it, the expression \"including\" was deliberately inserted in the article.

If Article 129 is susceptible to two inter- pretations, we would pref er to accept the interpretation which would a preserve the inherent jurisdiction of this Court being the superior court of record, to safeguard and protect the subordinate judiciary, which forms the very backbone of administration of justice. The subordinate courts administer justice at the grassroot level, their protection is neces- sary to preserve the confidence of people in the efficacy of courts and to b ensure unsullied flow of justice at its base level. 30. Disputing the inherent power of this Court with regard to the contempt of subordinate courts, Mr Nariman contended that inherent powers are always preserved, but they do not authorise a court to invest itself with jurisdiction when that jurisdiction is not conferred by law. He c urged that the status of an appellate court like High Court, does not enable the High Court to claim original jurisdiction not vested by law. Similarly, the Supreme Court having appellant jurisdiction under Sec- tion 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, cannot invest itself with original jurisdiction for contempt of subordinate courts. He placed Ci reliance on the decision of this Court in Raja Soap Factory v. S.P. Shantharaj 25• We are unable to accept the contention. In Raja Soap Fac- tory casei.s, High Court had entertained an original suit and issued injunc- tion under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 although under the Act the suit was required to be instituted in the District Court. In 8 appeal before this Court, order of the High Court was sought to be justified on the ground of High Court's power of transfer under Section 24 read with its inherent power under Section 151 of the Oxle of Civil Procedure. This Court rejected the submission on the ground that f exercise of jurisdiction under Section 24 of Code of Civil Procedure was conditioned by lawful institution of the proceeding in a subordinate court of competent jurisdiction, and transfer thereof to the High Court. The Court observed that power to ,try and dispose of proceedings, after trans- fer from a court lawfully seized• of it, does not involve a power to enter- ~ tain a proceeding which is not otherwise within the cognizance of the High Court. Referring to the claim of inherent powers under Section 151 to justify entertainment of the suit and grant of injunction order, the Court observed that the inherent power could be exercised where there is a proceeding lawfully before the High Court; it does not, however, fl authorise the High Court to invest itself with jurisdiction where it is not conferred by law. The facts and circumstances as available in the Raja Soap Factory casei.s, were quite different and the view expressed in that case do not have any bearing on the inherent power of this Court.

STATE OF GUJARAT (Singh, J.) 447 Raja Soap Factory case15 there was no issue before the Court regarding the inherent power of a superior court of record; instead the entire case related to the interpretation of the statutory provisions conferring juris- diction on the High Court. Where jurisdiction is conferred on a court by a statute, the extent of jurisdiction is limited to the extent prescribed under the statute. But there is no such limitation on a superior court of record in matters relating to the exercise of constitutional powers. No doubt this Court has appellate jurisdiction under Section 19 of the Act, but that does not divest it of its inherent power under Article 129 of the Constitution. The conferment of appellate power on the court by a statute does not and cannot affect the width and amplitude of inherent powers of this Court under Article 129 of the Constitution. 31. We have already disc~ed a number of decisions holding that the High Court being a court of record has inherent power in respect of contempt of itself as well as of its subordinate courts even in the absence of any express provision in any Act. A fortiori the Supreme Court being the Apex Court of the country and superior court of record should pos- sess the same inherent jurisdiction and power for taking action for con- tempt of itself as well as for the contempt of subordinate and inferior courts. It was contended that since High Court has power of super- intendence over the subordinate courts under Article 227 of the Con- stitution, therefore, High Court has power to punish for the contempt of subordinate courts. Since the Supreme Court has no supervisory jurisdic- tion over the High Court or other subordinate courts, it does not possess powers which High Courts have under Article 215. This submission is misconceived. Article 227 confers supervisory jurisdiction on the High Court and in exercise of that power High Court may correct judicial orders of subordinate courts, in addition to that, the High Court has administrative control over the subordinate courts. Supreme Court's power to correct judicial orders of the subordinate courts under Article 136 is much wider and more effective than that contained under Article 227. Absence of administrative power of superintendence over the High Courts and subordinate courts does not affect this Court's wide power of judicial superintendence of all courts in India. Once there is power of judicial superintendence, all the courts whose orders are amenable to correction by this Court would be subordinate courts and therefore this Court also possesses similar inherent power as the High Court has under Article 215 with regard to the contempt of subordinate courts. The juris- diction and power of a superior Court of Record to punish contempt of subordinate courts was not founded on the Court's administrative power of superintendence, instead the inherent jurisdiction was conceded to ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Mr Nariman urged that assumption of contempt jurisdiction with a regard to contempt of subordinate and inferior courts on the interpreta- tion of Article 129 of the Constitution is foreclosed by the decisions of Federal Court. He placed reliance on the decisions of Federal Court in KL. Gauba v. Hon 'ble the Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court of Judicature at Lahore~ and Purshottam Lal Jaitly v. King-Emperor'. He b urged that this Court being successor to Federal Court was bound by the decisions of the Federal Court under Article 374(2) of the Constitution. Mr Sorabjee, the learned Attorney General, seriously contested the proposition. He contended that there is a marked difference between the Federal Court and this Court, former being established by a statute with c limited jurisdiction while this Court is the apex constitutional court with unlimited jurisdiction, therefore, the Federal Court decisions are not binding on this Court. He urged that Article 374(2) does not bind this Court with the decisions of the Federal Court, instead it provides for meeting particular situation during transitory period. In the alternative d learned Attorney General urged that the aforesaid two decisions of Fed- eral Court in Gauba case~ and Jaitly case21 do not affect the jurisdiction and power of this Court with regard to contempt of subordinate and inferior courts as the Federal Court had no occasion to interpret any provision like Article 129 of the Constitution in the aforesaid decisions. e Article 374 made provision for the continuance of Federal Court Judges as the Judges of the Supreme Court on the commencement of the Con- stitution and it also made provisions for transfer of the proceedings pending in the Federal Court to the Supreme Court. Clause (2) of Arti- f de 374 is as under: \"374.

This was necessary for the continuance of the proceedings before the Supreme Court. The Fed- b eral Court may have passed interlocutory orders, it may have delivered judgments in the matters pending before it and in order to maintain the continuance of validity of orders or judgments of Federal Court a legal fiction was created stating that those judgments and orders shall be treated as of Supreme Court. Article 374(2) is in the nature of transitory c provision to meet the exigency of the situation on the abolition of the Federal Court and setting up of the Supreme Court. There is no provi- sion in the aforesaid article to the effect that the decisions of the Federal Court shall be binding on the Supreme Court. Similar view was taken by the Allahabad High Court in Om Prakash Gupta v. United Provinces 28 d and Bombay High Court in State of Bombay v. Gajanan '-\\fahadev Bad- leyz:9. The decisions of Federal Court and the Privy Council made before the commencement of the Constitution are entitled to great respect but those decisions are not binding on this Court and it is always open to this Court to take a different view. In State of Bihar v. Abdul Majid'JO and e Shrinivas Krishnarao Kango v. Narayan Devji Kango 31, Federal Court decisions were not followed by this Court. There is, therefore, no merit in the contention that this Court is bound by the decisions of the Federal Court. f g h 33. But even otherwise the decisions of Federal Court in KL.

A Special Bench of the High Court of Lahore was con- stituted to decide his matters. His objection against the sitting of a particular Judge on the Special Bench, was rejected.

Gauba argued that the High Court was guilty of contempt of Federal Court as it had deliberately and maliciously deprived the Federal Court's jurisdiction a to hear the appeal against its orders. Gwyer, C.J. rejected the contention in the following words: ( AIR p. 2) \"We have had occasion more than once to construe the provi- sions of Section 205, and we repeat what we have already said, that no appeal lies to this Court in the absence of the certificate pres- b cribed by that section: a certificate is the necessary condition prece- dent to every appeal. We cannot question the refusal of a High Court to grant a certificate or investigate the reasons which have prompted the refusal; we cannot even inquire what those reasons were, if the High Court has given none. The matter is one exclusive- c ly for the High Court; and, as this C,0urt observed in an earlier case, it is not for us to speculate whether Parliament omitted per incuriam to give a right of appeal against the refusal to grant a certificate or trusted the High Courts to act with reasonableness and impartiality: 1939 FCR 13 at 16t. The jurisdiction of the Court being thus limited d by the statute in this way, how could it be extended by a High Court acting even perversely or maliciously in withholding the certificate?\" 34. In Purshottam Lal Jaitly case 21 an application purporting to invoke extraordinary original jurisdiction of the Federal Court under e Section 210(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935 was made with a prayer that the Federal Court should itself deal directly with an alleged contempt of a civil court, subordinate to the High Court. By a short order the Court rejected the application placing reliance on its decision in KL. Gauba case''-'. The Court observed as under: \"The expression 'any contempt of Court' in that provision must be held to mean 'any act amounting to contempt of this Court'. This was the view expressed in Gauba case 26 and we have been shown no reason for departing from that view. Under the Indian law the High Courts have power to deal with contempt of any court subordinate to them as well as with contempt of the High Courts. It could not have been intended to confer on the Federal Court a concurrent jurisdiction in such matters. The wider construction may conceivably lead to conflicting judgments and to other anomalous con- sequences.\" In the case of KL. Gouba11, the Federal Court found itself helpless in the matter as the Government of India Act, 1935 did not confer any power on it to entertain an appeal against the order of High Court refusing to grant certificate.

In Purshottam Lal Jaitly case21 the decision turned on the interpretation of Section 210(2) of the 1935 Act. Section 210 made provisions for the enforcement of decrees and orders of Federal Court. Sub-section (2) provided that Federal Court shall have power to make any order for the purpose of securing the attendance of any person, the discovery or production of any documents or the investigation or \"punishment of any contempt of court\", which any High Court has power to make as respects the territory within its jurisdiction, and further the Federal Court shall have power to award costs and its orders shall be enforceable by all courts. While interpreting Section 210(2) the Federal Court held that it had no power to deal with contempt of any court sub- ordinate to High Court and it further observed that the wider construc- tions may lead to conflicting judgments and to other anomalous con- sequences. It is not necessary for us to consider the correctness of the opinion expressed by the Federal Court, as jn our view the Federal Court was a court of limited jurisdiction, it was not the Apex Court like this Court as against the judgment, order and decree of the Federal Court appeals lay to the Privy Council. The Federal Court exercised limited jurisdiction as conferred on it by the 1935 Act. The question regarding the inherent power of the Superior C.,ourt of Record in respect of the contempt of subordinate court was neither raised nor discussed in afore- said decisions. The Federal Court observed that if the High Court and the Federal Court both have concurrent jurisdiction in contempt matters it could lead to conflicting judgments and anomalous consequences. That may be so under the Government of India Act as the High Court and the Federal Court did not have concurrent jurisdiction, but under the Con- stitution, High Court and the Supreme Court both have concurrent juris- diction in several matters, yet no anomalous consequences follow. 35. While considering the decision of Federal Court, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Federal Court did not possess wide powers as this Court has under the Constitution. There are marked differences in the constitution and jurisdiction and the amplitude of powers exercised by the two courts. In addition to civil and criminal appellate jurisdiction, this Court has wide powers under Article 136 over all the courts and tribunals in the country. The Federal Court had no such power, instead it had appellate power but th2.t too could be exercised only on a certificate issued by the High Court. The Federal Court was a court of record under Section 203 but it did not possess any plenary or residuary appellate power over all the courts functioning in the territory of India like the power conferred on this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution, therefore, the Federal Court had no judicial control or superintendence over subordinate courts. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The Constitution has assigned a new role to the Con- a stitutional Courts to ensure rule of law in the country. These changes have brought new perceptions. In interpreting the Constitution, we must have regard to the social, economic and political changes, need of the community and the independence of judiciary. The court cannot be a helpless spectator, bound by precedents of colonial days which have lost b relevance. Time has come to have a fresh look at the old precedents and to lay down law with the changed perceptions keeping in view the provi- sions of the Constitution. \"Law\", to use the words of Lord Coleridge, \"grows; and though the principles of Jaw remain unchanged, yet their application is to be changed with the changing circumstances of the c time\". The considerations which weighed with the Federal C..ourt in rendering its decision in Gauba 26 and Jaitly case21 are no more relevant in the contexl of the constitutional provisions. 37. Since this Court has power of judicial superintendence and con- trol over all the courts and tribunals functioning in the entire territory of d the country, it has a corresponding duty to protect and safeguard the interest of inferior courts to ensure the flow of the stream of justice in the courts without any interference or attack from any quarter. The sub- ordinate and inferior courts do not have adequate power under the law e to protect themselves, therefore, it is necessary that this court should protect them. Under the constitutional scheme this court has a special role, in the administration of justice and the powers conferred on it under Articles 32, 136, 141 and 142 form part of basic structure of the Constitution. The amplitude of the power of this Court under these arti- f cles of the Constitution cannot be curtailed by law made by Central or State legislature. If the contention raised on behalf of the contemners is accepted, the courts all over India will have no protection from this Court. No doubt High Courts have power to persist for the contempt of subordinate courts but that does not affect or abridge the inherent power 9 of this Court under Article 129. The Supreme Court and the High Court both exercise concurrent jurisdiction under the constitutional scheme in matters relating to fundamental rights under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, therefore this Court's jurisdiction and power to take action for contempt of subordinate courts would not be inconsistent to any con- h stitutional scheme. There may be occasions when attack on Judges and Magistrates of subordinate courts may have wide repercussions throughout the country, in that situation it may not be possible for a High Court to contain the same, as a result of which the administration of justice in the country may be paralysed, in that situation the Apex ; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The Apex Court is duty bound to take effective steps within the constitutional provisions to ensure a free and fair administration of justice throughout the country, for that purpose it must wield the requisite power to take action for contempt of subordinate courts. Ordinarily, the High Court would protect the subordinate court from any onslaught on their independence, but in exceptional cases. extraordinary situation may prevail affecting the administration of public justice or where the entire judiciary is affected, this Court may directly take cognizance of contempt of subordinate courts. We would like to strike a note of caution that this Court will sparingly exercise its inherent power in taking cognizance of the contempt of subordinate courts, as ordinarily matters relating to con- tempt of subordinate courts must be dealt with by the High Courts. The instant case is of exceptional nature, as the incident created a situation where functioning of the subordinate courts all over the country was adversely affected, and the administration of justice wa~ paralysed, there- fore, this Court took cognizance of the matter. 38. Mr N ariman contended that in our country there is no court of universa] jurisdiction, as the jurisdiction of all courts including the Supreme Court is limited. Article 129 as well as the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 do not confer any express power on this Court with regard to contempt of the subordinate courts, this Court cannot by construing Article 129 assume jurisdiction in the matter which is not entrusted to it by law. He placed reliance on the observations of this Court in Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra 32• We have carefully considered the decision but we find nothing therein to support the contention of Mr Nariman. It is true that courts constituted under a law enacted by the Parliament or the State legislature have limited jurisdiction and they can- not assume jurisdiction in a matter, not expressly assigned to them, but that is not so in the case of a superior court of record constituted by the Constitution. Such a court does not have a limited jurisdiction instead it has power to determine its own jurisdiction. No matter is beyond the jurisdiction of a superior court of record unless it is expressly shown to be so, under the provisions of the Constitution. In the absence of any express provision in the Constitution the Apex Court being a court of record has jurisdiction in every matter and if there be any doubt, the Court has power to determine its jurisdiction. If such determination is made by High Court, the same would be subject to appeal to this Court, but if the jurisdiction is determined by this Court it would be final.

In Mirajknr case 32 this Court again reiterated the principles that a superior court of record unlike a court of limited jurisdiction is entitled to determine about its own jurisdiction. In Ganga Bishan v. Jai Narain 34 the Court emphasised that the Constitution has left it to the judicial discretion of Supreme Court to decide for itself the scope and limits of its jurisdiction in order to render substantiai justice in matters coming before it. We therefore hold that this Court being the Apex Court and a superior court of record has power to determine its jurisdiction under Article 129 of the Constitution, and as discussed earlier it has jurisdiction to initiate or entertain proceedings for contempt of subordinate courts. This view does not run counter to any provision of the Constitution. 39. Constitutional hurdles over, now we would revert back to the incident which has given rise to these proceedings. The genesis of the unprecedented attack on the subordinate judiciary arose out of con- frontational attitude of the local police against the Magistracy in Kheda. The Chief Judicial Magistrate is head of the Magistracy in the district. Under the provisions of Chapter XII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, he exercises control and supervision over the investigating officer. He is an immediate officer on the spot at the lower rung of the adminis- tration of justice of the country to ensure that the police which is the law enforcing machinery acts according to law in investigation of crimes without indulging in excesses and causing harassment to citizens. The main objective of police is to apprehend offend~rs, to investigate crimes and to prosecute them before the courts and also to prevent commission of crime and above all to ensure law and order to protect the citizens' life and property. The law enjoins the police to be scrupulously fair to the offender and the Magistracy is to ensure fair investigation and fair trial to an off ender. The purpose and object of Magistracy and police are com- plementary to each other. It is unfortunate that these objectives have remained unfulfilled even after 40 years of our Constitution.

STATE OF GUJARAT (Singh, J.) 455 of police officers and police excesses in dealing with the law and order situation have been the subject of adverse comments from this Court as well as from other courts but it has failed to have any corrective effect on it. The police has power to arrest a person even without obtaining a war- rant of arrest from a court. The amplitude of this power casts an obliga- tion on the police to take maximum care in exercising that power. The police must bear in mind, as held by this Court that if a person is arrested for a crime, his constitutional and fundamental rights must not be vio- lated. See Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration 35• In Prem Shankar Shukla ease 1 this Court considered the question of placing a prisoner under handcuff by the police. The Court declared that no prisoner shall be handcuffed or fettered routinely or merely for the convenience of custody or escort. The Court emphasised that the police did not enjoy any unrestricted or unlimited power to handcuff an arrested person . If having regard to the circumstances including the conduct , behaviour and character of a prisoner, there is reasonable apprehension of prisoner's escape from custody or disturbance of peace by violence, the police may put the prisoner under handcuff. If a prisoner is handcuffed without there being any justification, it would violate prisoner's fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. To be consistent with Articles 14 and 19 handcuffs must be the last refuge as there are other ways for ensuring security of a prisoner. In Prem Shankar Shukla ease 1, Krishna Iyer, J. observed: (SCC p. 529, para 1) \"If today freedom of the forlorn person falls to the police some- where, tomorrow the freedom of many may fall elsewhere with none to whimper unless the court process invigilates in time and polices the police before it is too late.\" ( emphasis in original) The prophetic words of Krishna Iyer, J. have come true as the facts of the present case would show. 40. In the instant case, Patel, CJM, was assaulted, arrested and handcuffed bv Police Inspector Sharma and other police officers. The police officers were not content with this, they tied him with a thick rope round his arms and body as if N.L. Patel was a wild animal. As discussed carliet, he was taken in that condition to the hospital for medical exam- ination where he was made to sit in veranda exposing him to the public gaze, providing opportunity to the members of the public to see that the police had the power and privilege to apprehend and deal with a Chief Judicial Magistrate according to its sweet will. What was the purpose of unusual behaviour of the police, was it to secure safety and security of N.L. Patel, or was it done to prevent escape or any violent activity on his part justifying the placing of handcuffs and ropes on the body of N.L. 35 c 1978) 4 sec 494: 1979 sec (Cri) 155 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The Commission has recorded detailed findings that the object was to wreak vengeance and to humiliate the CJM who had been polic- ing the police by his judicial orders. a 41. We agree with the findings recorded by the Commission that there was no justification for this extraordinary and unusual behaviour of Police Inspector Sharma and other police officers although they made an attempt to justify their unprecedented, dehumanising behaviour on the ground that Patel was drunk, and he was behaving in violent manner and b if he had not been handcuffed or tied with ropes, he could have snatched Sharma's revolver and killed him. We are amazed at the reasons given by Sharma justifying the handcuffs and ropes on the body of N.L. Patel. Patel was unarmed, he was at the Police Station in a room, there were at least seven police officials present in the room who were fully armed, yet, c there was apprehension about Patel's escape or violent behaviour justify- ing handcuffs and roping. The justification given by them is flimsy and preposterous. S.R. Sharma acted in utter disregard of this Court's direc- tion in Prem Shankar Shukla ease 1• His explanation that he was not aware of the decision of this Court is a mere pretence as the Com- d missioner has recorded findings that Gujarat Government had issued cir- cular letter to the police incorporating the guidelines laid down by this Court in Prem Shanker Shukla ease1 with regard to the handcuffing of prisoners. e . 42. What constitutes contempt of court? The Common Law defini- tion of contempt of court is: \"An act or omission calculated to interfere with the due administration of justice.\" [Bowen L.J. in He/more v. Smith (No. 2) 36J. The contempt of court as defined by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 includes civil and criminal contempt. Criminal contempt as defined [in Section 2(c)J by the Act: \"means the publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representations, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which (i) scandalizes or tends to scandalize, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court; or (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes. or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner;\" The definition of criminal contempt is wide enough to include any act by a person which would tend to interfere with the administration of justice 36 (1886) 35 Ch D 436,455: (1886) 31 Sol Jo 60 f g h i ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The public have a vital stake in effective and orderly administration of justice. The Court has the duty a of protecting the interest of the community in the due administration of justice and, so, it is entrusted with the power to commit for contempt of court, not to protect the dignity of the Court against insult or injury, but, to protect and vindicate the right of the public so that the administration of justice is not perverted, prejudiced, obstructed or interfered with. \"It b is a mode of vindicating the majesty of law, in its active manifestation, against obstruction and outrage.\" (Frankfurter, J. in Offutt v. U.S. 37) The object and purpose of punishing contempt for interference with the administration of justice is not to safeguard or protect the dignity of the Judge or the Magistrate, but the purpose is to preserve the authority of c the courts to ensure an ordered life in society. In Attorney General v. d e f g h Times Newspapers-Ja, the necessity for the law of contempt was sum- marised by Lord Morris as: (AC p. 302) \"In an ordered community courts are established for the pacific settlement of disputes and for the maintenance of law and order. In the general interests of the community it is imperative that the authority of the courts should not be imperilled and that recourse to them should not be subject to unjustifiable interference. When such unjustifiable interference is suppressed it is not because those charged with the responsibilities of administering justice are con- cerned for their own dignity: it is because the very structure of ordered life is at risk if the recognised courts of the land are so flouted and their authority wanes and is supplanted.\" 43. The Chief Judicial Magistrate is head of the Magistracy in the district who administers justice to ensure, protect and safeguard the rights of citizens. The subordinate courts at the district level cater to the need of the masses in administering justice at the base level. By and large the majority of the people get their disputes adjudicated in subordinate courts. it is, in the general interest of the community that the authority of subordinate courts is protected. If the CJM is led into trap by unscrupulous police officers and if he is assaulted, handcuffed and roped, the public is bound to lose faith in courts, which would be destructive of basic structure of an ordered society. If this is permitted Rule of Law shall be supplanted by Police Raj. Viewed in this perspective the incident is not a case of physical assault on an individual judicial officer instead it is an onslaught on the institution of the judiciary itself. The incident is a clear interference with the administration of justice, lowering its judicial authority. Its effect was not confined to one District or State, it had a tendency to effect the entire judiciary in the country.

The conduct of police officers in assaulting and humiliating the CJM brought the authority and administration of justice into disrespect, affecting the public confidence in the institution of justice. \"The sum- mary power of punishment for contempt has been conferred on the courts to keep a blaze of glory around them, to deter people from b attempting to render them contemptible in the eyes of the public. These powers are necessary to keep the course of justice free, as it is of great importance to society.\" (Oswald on Contempt of Court). The power to punish contempt is vested in the Judges not for their personal protection only, but for the protection of public justice, whose interest requires that c decency and decorum is preserved in Courts of Justice. Those who have to discharge duty in a Court of Justice are protected by the law, and shielded in the discharge of their duties, any deliberate interference with the discharge of such duties either in court or outside the court by attack- ing the presiding officers of the court, would amount to criminal con- d tempt and the courts must take serious cognizance of such conduct. 44. It takes us to the question against which of the contemners con- tempt is made out. On behalf of the petitioners it was urged that the police officers' conduct amounts to criminal contempt as their action lowered the authority of the Chief Judicial Magistrate and it further e caused interference with the administration of justice. Mr Soli J. Sorab- jee, learned Attorney General contended that all those who abetted and helped the police officers in their conduct and design are also guilty of contempt of court. On behalf of the contemners it was urged that the f incident which took place in the Police Station does not make out any contempt of court. The Chief Judicial Magistrate had consumed liquor and in drunken state he went to the Police Station and slapped the Police Inspector, Sharma, thereby he committed offence under the Bom- bay Prohibition Act as well as under Sections 332, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code. Criminal cases have been registered against N.L. g Patel, CJM and after investigation charge-sheets have been submitted to the court. In this context, it was urged that no action could be taken against the contemners a'i the facts in issue in the present proceedings are the same as involved in the criminal prosecutions pending against h N.L. Patel, CJM. The question raised on behalf of the contemners need not detain us long. Proceedings for contempt of court are different than those taken for the prosecution of a person for an offence under the eriminal jurisdiction.

Criminal prosecution pending against the CJM or against the contemners has no bearing on the contempt proceedings initiated by this Court as the present proceed- ings are not for the purpose of punishing the contemners for the offence of wrongful detention and assault on N.L. Patel, Chief Judicial Magistrate, instead these proceedings have been taken to protect the interest of the public in the due administration of justice and to preserve the confidence of people in courts. We, accordingly, reject the con- tcmner's objection. 45. We have already recorded findings that Sharma, Police Inspector, Nadiad had preplanned the entire scheme, he deliberately invited Patel to visit Police Station where he was forced to consume liquor and on his refusal he was ao;saulted, arrested, handcuffed and tied with rope. S.R. Sharma, KH. Sadia, Sub-Inspector, Valjibhai Kalabhai. Head Constable and Pratap Singh, Constable, aJI took active part in this shameful episode with a view to malign and denigrate the CJM on account of his judicial orders against the police. We, therefore, hold S.R. Sharma, Police Inspector, K.H. Sadia, Sub-Inspector, Valjibhai Kalabhai Head Constable and Pratap Singh, Constable guilty of contempt of court. M.B. Savant. Mamlatdar had been summoned by Sharma, Police Inspector, to the Police Station in advance for purposes of being witness to the panchnama drawn up by Sharma describing drunken condition of Patel, OM. The document was false and deliberately prepared to make out a case against Patel, CJM. M.B. Savant was in complicity with Sharma, he actively participated in the preparation of the document to malign and humiliate the OM and to prepare a false case against him, he is also, therefore, guilty of contempt of court. 46. As regards D.K. Dhagal, the then District Superintendent of Police, Kheda, we have already recorded findings that he was hand in glove with Sharma, Police Inspector. The circumstances pointed out by the Commission and as discussed earlier, show that though DJ(. Dhagal, had not personally participated in the shameful episode but his conduct, act and omission establish his complicity in the incident. It is difficult to believe or imagine that a Police Inspector would arrest, humiliate, assault and handcuff a OM and the Police Chief in the district would be indifferent, or a mute spectator. The circumstances unequivocally show that Sharma was acting under the protective cover of Dhagal as he did not take any immediate action in the matter instead he created an alibi for himself by interpolating the entries in the register at the Government Rest House, Bala~inor, In his report submitted to the Addl. Chief Secretary (Home) on September 27, 1989, Dhagal did not even remotely mention the handcuffing and roping of the OM.

We, accordingly, hold DJ{. Dhagal, the then DSP, Kheda guilty of contempt of court. 47. This takes us to the petition filed by N.L. Patel for quashing the criminal cases initiated against him on the basis of two first infonnation reports made by Police Inspector S.R. Sharma. As noticed earlier b Sharma, Police Inspector, had registered two FIRs on September 25, 1989 against N.L. Patel for the offences under Section 85(1 )(3) read with Section 66(1)(b) and also under Section 110 of Bombay Prohibition Act on the allegations that Patel had consumed liquor without permit or pass and under the influence of alcohol entered into Sharma's chamber and c behaved in an indecent manner. The FIR further alleged that Patel caught hold of Police Inspector Sharma and slapped him. The second FIR was lodged by Shanna against Patel for offences under Sections 332, 353, 186 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code on the same allegations as contained in the earlier FIR. During the pendency of the contempt d proceedings before this Court, the police continued the investigation and submitted charge-sheet in both the cases against N.L. Patel and at present Criminal Cases Nos. 1998 of 1990 and 1999 of 1990 are pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nadiad. These proceedings are e sought to be quashed. 48. On behalf of the State and the police officers, it was urged that since charge-sheets have already been submitted to the court, Patel will have full opportunity to defend himself before the court where witnesses would be examined and cross-examined, therefore, this Court should not f interfere with the proceedings. The gravamen of the charge in the two cases registered against N.L. Patel is that he had consumed liquor without a pass or pennit and under the influence of liquor, he entered the chamber of Police Inspector Sharma at the Police Station and assaulted him. The police overpowered and arrested him and a pan- g chnama was prepared and he was taken to the hospital for medical exam- ination, and the report of medical examination indicates that he had con- sumed liquor. These very facts have been inquired into by the Com- missioner and found to be false. We have recorded findings that Police Inspector Sharma and other police officers manipulated records and h manufactured the case against N.L. Patel with a view to humiliate and teach him a lesson as the police was annoyed with his judicial orders. We have already recorded findings holding S.R.

These very persons are specified as witnesses in the two charge-sheets. The Commission's as well as our findings clearly demonstrate that the allegations contained in the two FIRs are false. If police is permitted to prosecute Patel on those allegations merely on the basis that charge-sheets have been submitted by it, it would amount to gross abuse of the process of the court. In the circumstances, proceed- ings against N.L. Patel are liable to be quashed. 49. Learned counsel, appearing on behalf of the State of Gujarat and the police officers, urged that in the present proceedings this Court has no jurisdiction or power to quash the criminal proceedings pending against N .L. Patel, CJM. Elaborating his contention, learned counsel submitted that once a criminal case is registered against a person the law requires that the court should allow the case to proceed to its normal conclusion and there should be no interference with the process of trial. He further urged that this Court has no power to quash a trial pending before the criminal court either under the Code of Criminal Procedure or under the Constitution, therefore, the criminal proceedings pending against Patel should be permitted to continue. Learned Attorney Gener- al submitted that since this Court has taken cognizance of the contempt matter arising out of the incident which is the subject matter of trial before the criminal court, this Court has ample power under Article 142 of the Constitution to pass any order necessary to do justice and to prevent abuse of process of the court. The learned Attorney General elaborated that there is no limitation on the power of this Court under Article 142 in quashing a criminal proceeding pending before a sub- ordinate court. Before we proceed to consider the width and amplitude of this Court's power under Article 142 of the Constitution it is necessary to remind ourselves that though there is no provision like Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code conferring express power on this Court to quash or set aside any criminal proceedings pending before a criminal court to prevent abuse of process of the court, but this Court has power to quash any such proceedings in exercise of its plenary and residuary power under Article 136 of the Constitution, if on the admitted facts no charge is made out against the accused or if the proceedings are initiated on concocted facts, or if the proceedings are initiated for oblique pur- poses. Once this Court is satisfied that the criminal proceedings amount to abuse of process of court it would quash such proceedings to ensure justice. Jn State of W.B. v.

Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre 40, criminal proceedings were quashed as this Court was satisfied that the case was founded on false facts, and the proceedings for trial had a been initiated for oblique purposes. 50. Article 142(1) of the Constitution provides that Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any 'cause' or 'matter' pending before it. The expression 'cause' or 'matter' would include any proceed- b ing pending in court and it would cover almost every kind of proceeding in court including civil or criminal. The inherent power of this Court under Article 142 coupled with the plenary and residuary powers under Articles 32 and 136 embraces power to quash criminal proceedings pend- ing before any court to do complete justice in the matter before this c Court. If the court is satisfied that the proceedings in a criminal case are being utilised for oblique purposes or if the same are continued on manufactured and false evidence or if no case is made out on the admitted facts, it would be in the ends of justice to set aside or quash the criminal proceedings. It is idle to suggest that in such a situation this d Court should be a helpless spectator. 51. Mr Nariman urged that Article 142(1) does not contemplate any order contrary to statutory provisions. He placed reliance on the Court's observations in Prem Chand Garg v. Excise Commissioner, U.P., e Allahabad 41 and A.R Antulay v. RS. Nayak42, where the Court observed that though the powers conferred on this Court under Article 142(1) are very wide, but in exercise of that power the Court cannot make any order plainly inconsistent with the express statutory provisions of substantive law. It may be noticed that in Prem Chand Ga,g11 and Antulay case 42 f observations with regard to the extent of this Court's power under Arti- cle 142(1) were made in the context of fundamental rights. Those obser- vations have no bearing on the question in issue as there is no provision in any substantive law restricting this Court's power to quash proceedings pending before subordinate court. This Court's power under Article g 142(1) to do \"complete justice\" is entirely of different level and of a dif- ferent quality. Any prohibition or restriction contained in ordinary laws cannot act as a limitation on the constitutional power of this Court. Once this Court has seisin of a cause or matter before it, it has power to issue any order or direction to do \"complete justice\" in the matter. This con- h stitutional power of the Apex Court cannot be limited or restricted by provisions contained in statutory law. In Harbans Singh v.

Sen, J. in his concurring opinion observed: (SCC pp. 107-08, para 20) \"Very wide powers have been conferred on this Court for due and proper administration of justice. Apart from the jurisdiction and powers conferred on this Court under Articles 32 and 136 of the Constitution I am of the opinion that this Court retains and must retain, an inherent power and jurisdiction for dealing with any extraordinary situation in the larger interests of administration of justice and for preventing manifest injustice being done. This power must necessarily be sparingly used only in exceptional circumstances for furthering the ends of justice.\" No enactment made by Central or State legislature can limit or restrict the power of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution, though while exercising power under Article 142 of the Constitution, the Court must take into consideration the statutory provisions regulating the mat- ter in dispute. What would be the need of \"complete justice\" in a cause or matter would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and while exercising that power the Court would take into consideration the express provisions of a substantive statute. Once this Court has taken seisin of a case, cause or matter, it has power to pass any order or issue direction as may be necessary to do complete justice in the matter. This has been the consistent view of this Court as would appear from the deci- sions of this Court in State of U.P. v. Poosu«; Ganga Bishan v. Jai Narain 45; Navnit R. Kamani v. R.R. Kamani 46; B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Mysore◄1 ; Special Reference No. 1 of 196433 and Harbans Singh v. State of UP. 43 Since the foundation of the criminal trial of N.L. Patel is based on the facts which have already been found to be false, it would be in the ends of justice and also to do complete justice in the cause to quash the criminal proceedings. We accordingly quash the criminal proceedings pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nadiad in Criminal Cases Nos. 1998 of 1990 and 1999 of 1990. 52. The question arises what punishment should be awarded to the contemners found guilty of contempt. In determining the punishment, the degree and the extent of part played by each of the contemners has to be kept in mind. Sharma, Police Inspector who was the main actor in the entire incident and who had planned the entire episode with a view to humiliate the CJM in the public eye is the main culprit, therefore, he deserves maximum punishment. Sadia, Sub-Inspector took active part in assaulting and tying the CJM at the behest of Sharma, Police Inspector. 44 (1976) 3 sec 1: 1976 sec (Cri) 368: (1976) 3 scR 100s 45 (1986) 1 sec 75 46 c t 988) 4 sec 387 47 (1966) 3 SCR 682: AIR 1966 SC 1942: (1967) 1 LU 698 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

M.B. a Savant, Mamlatdar was friendly to Shanna, Police Inspector, he had no axe to grind against the CJM but he acted under the influence of Shanna, Police Inspector. So far as D.K Dhagal is concerned, he actively abetted the commission of onslaught on the CJM. Having regard to the facts and circumstances and individual part played by each of the afore- b said contemners we hold them guilty of contempt and award punishment as under: S.R. Sharma, the then Police Inspector, Nadiad shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months and he shall pay fine of Rs 2000. KH. Sadia, Sub-Inspector, Nadiad shall undergo simple imprisonment c for a period of five months and will pay a fine of Rs 2000 and in default he will undergo one month's simple imprisonment. Valjibhai Kalabhai, Head Constable and Pratap Singh, Constable, both are convicted and awarded simple imprisonment for a period of two months and a fine of Rs 500 each, in default they would undergo simple imprisonment for a d further period of 15 days. M.B. Savant, Mamlatdar is convicted and awarded two months' simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1000 and in default he would undergo one month's simple jmprisonment. D.K Dhagal, the then District Superintendent of Police. K.heda, is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of one month and to pay a e fine of Rs 1000 and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for 15 days. So far as other respondents against whom notices of contempt have been issued by the Court, there is no adequate material on record to hold them guilty of contempt of court, we accordingly discharge the notices f issued to them. 53. Before we proceed further, we would like to express the Court's displeasure on the conduct of K Dadabhoy, the then Director General of Police, Gujarat. As the head of the police in the State he was expected to intervene in the matter and to ensure effective action against the err- g ing police officers. We are constrained to observe that he was totally indifferent to the news that a CJM was arrested. handcuffed, roped and assaulted. He took this news as a routine matter without taking any steps to ascertain the correct facts or effective action against the erring police officers. If the head of the police administration in the State exhibits such h indifference to a sensitive matter which shook the entire judicial machinery in the State, nothing better could be expected from his sub- ordinate officers. K Dadabhoy did not act like a responsible officer. The State Government should ta~e action against him departmentally on the basis of the findings recorded by the Commission.

STATE OF GUJARAT (Singh, J.) 465 has initiated proceedings against other erring officers in respect of whom the Commission has adversely commented, we would make it clear that discharge of contempt notices does not absolve those officers of their misconduct, the State Government is directed to proceed with the dis- ciplinary proceedings for taking appropriate action against them. 54. We are constrained to observe that the State Government did not immediately take effective steps against the erring officials. In spite of the direction issued by this Court the erring police officers were neither arrested nor placed under suspension. It was only after this Court l1...,0k serious view of the matter and directed the State Government to suspend the erring police officers and arrest them, the State Government moved in the matter. The apathy of the State Government in taking effective action against the erring police officers leads to an impression that in the State of Gujarat, police appears to have upper hand, as the administration was hesitant in taking action against the erring police officers. If this practice and tendency is allowed to grow it would result in serious erosion of the Rule of Law in the State. We hope and trust that the State Government will take effective measures to avoid reoccurrence of any such instance. The State Government should further take immediate steps for the review and revision of the Police Regulations in the light of the findings recorded by the Commission. 55. The facts of the instant case demonstrate that a presiding officer of a court may be arrested and humiliated on flimsy and manufactured charges which could affect the administration of justice. In order to avoid any such situation in future, we consider it necessary to lay down guidelines which should be followed in the case of arrest and detention of a Judicial Officer. No person whatever his rank. or designation may be. is above law and he must face the penal consequences of infraction of criminal law. A Magistrate, Judge or any other Judicial Officer is liable to criminal prosecution for an offence like any other citizen but in view of the paramount necessity of preserving the independence of judiciary and at the same time ensuring that infractions of law are properly investigated, we think that the following guidelines should be followed: (A) If a Judicial Officer is to be arrested for some offence, it should be done under intimation to the District Judge or the High Court as the case may be. (B) If facts and circumstances necessitate the immediate arrest of a Judicial Officer of the subordinate judiciary, a technical or for- mal arrest may be effected. (C) The fact of such arrest should be immediately communica- ted to the District and Sessions J udgc of the concerned District and the Chief Justice of the High Court. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(F) No statement of a Judicial Officer who is under arrest be recorded nor any panchnama be drawn up nor any medical tests be b conducted except in the presence of the Legal Adviser of the Judi- cial Officer concerned or another Judicial Officer of equal or higher rank, if available. (G) There should be no handcuffing of a Judicial Officer. If, however, violent resistance to arrest is offered or there is imminent c need to effect physical arrest in order to avert danger to life and limb, the person resisting arrest may be overpowered and hand- cuffed. In such case, immediate report shall be made to the District and Sessions Judge concerned and also to the Chief Justice of the High Court. But the burden would be on the police to establish the d necessity for effecting physical arrest and handcuffing the Judicial Officer and if it be established that the physical arrest and handcuff- ing of the Judicial Officer was unjustified, the police officers causing or responsible for such arrest and handcuffing would be guilty of misconduct and would also be personally liable for compensation and/or damages as may be summarily determined by the High Court. e 56. The above guidelines are not exhaustive but these are minimum safeguards which must be observed in case of arrest of a Judicial Officer. These guidelines should be implemented by the State Government as well as by the High Courts. We, accordingly, direct that a copy of the guidelines shall be forwarded to the Chief Secretaries of all the State Governments and to all the High Courts with a direction that the same may be brought to the notice of the concerned officers for compliance. f 57. We do not approve N.L. Patel's conduct in visiting the Police Station on the invitation of Police Inspector Sharma. In our opinion, no Judicial Officer should visit a Police Station on his own except in connec- tion with his official and judicial duties and functions. If it is necessary for a Judicial Officer or a Subordinate Judicial Officer to visit the Police Sta- tion in connection with his official duties, he must do so with prior intimation of his visit to the District and Sessions Judge. 58.
