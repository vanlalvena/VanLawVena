Section 14 has been enacted with the object of affording protection against the bar of limitation to a person in good faith doing his best . to get his case tried on the merits but failing through the Court being unable to give him such a trial. It is intended to provide relief to one who initiates proceedings which by reason of some technical defect are thrown out. Such a party is given the right to exclude the time spent, over infructuous proceedings in computing the period of limitation for filing the suit; it provides for cases where a plaintiff in absolute good faith but under a mistaken notion sues in a wrong court. [Page 491 paras E & F] The words \"good faith\" for the purpose of section 14 have to be con- strued in the sense they have been ddined in the Limitation Act and not in the General Clauses Act. According to the General Clauses Act \"a thing shall be deemed to be done in good faith where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not.\" The definition, as given in the Limitation Act, is however, to the effect that \"nothing shall be deemed to be done in good faith which is not done with due care and attention.\" The question as to whether a plaintiff had prosecuted an earlier suit or civil proceedings in good faith and with due diligence is a question of fact depending upon the circumstances of each case. Although no hard and fast rules can be laid down, it can be stated as a broad proposition that the section does not help a person who is guilty of negligence, laches, inaction or carelessness. At the same time it has to be· borne in mind that an element of mistake is inherent in the invocation of Section 14. In fact the Section is intended to provide relief against the bar of limitation in cases of mistaken remedy or selection of a wrong forum. A mistaken view of law would not neces- sarily connote lack of good faith. To adopt this view ·could result in making a dead letter of Section 14. All that has to be seen is whether there was material on the basis of which the plaintiff could have reasona- bly taken the view, however erroneous it may be, that the remedy he was pursuing or the forum he was selecting would secure for him the relief he was seeking in the suit. [Page 492 paras E to H] A suit was instituted, in the first instance, in the Court of Senior Subordinate Judge, Simla, but the plaint was returned for presentation to a proper Court on the ground that the Court of Simla had no juris- diction to try the suit.

The plaintiff there- after sent many letters to the defendant asking fol\" the despatch of wheat to Simla but the defendant failed to do so. On August 11, 1947 the defendant wrote a letter to the plaintiff expressing .: inability to despatch the goods ·on the ground that the Superin-· tendent Food Grains had refused to grant permit for the despatch ·. of wheat from Lyallpur to any other district as there was shortage : · of food grains at Lyallpur. The plaintiff was asked by the defendant : as to whether the amount of Rs. 10,000/- was to be sent ba~k = to Simla. The plaintiff t~reupon wrote to the defendant that ~ since the latter had not been able to consign the wheat for two · months, the defendant should remit the money back to Sm:ila . along with permit for 1400 maunds of wheat. On receipt of that . letter the defendant wrote back to the plaintiff that the defendant - was willing to refund Rs. 10,000/- to the plaintiff but the amount . . could not be sent by draft lest it might be lost in transit on account - of disturbances. The plaintiff was asked to draw a hundi on _t)le - qefendant for R,s. 10,000/-.'

The plaintiff added that the A J>laintlff-firm had been advised that the Simla Court had got jurisdiction and was right in choosing the forum. Proceedings were stated to have been carried on bona fide at Simla and there- . -.after in the High Court. · The defendant-firm in the written statement filed through Ban- wari Lal stated that the plaintiff-firm was not registered and as · such was not competent to file the suit. The defendant-firm was · stated to have ceased to .exist on the exodus of its partners from Pakistan. As such, it was averred that the suit against the de- --fendant-firm was not maintainable. On merits it was admitted \"that the defendant received Rs. 10,000/- from the plaintiff for purchase of wheat. The amount was stated to be payable at Lyall- _pur and the bank ·charges were to be borne by the plaintiff and not by the defendant. According further to the defendant, the -defendant purchased wheat and stored it at Abbaspur railway ·station for despatch to Simla. From the date of purchase the _goods became the property of the plaintiff and were lying at Abbaspur at the plaintiff's risk. T4e defendant made all out efforts for transporting tlie .goods to Simla but these efforts failed .;as the Food Grains Officer prohibited the export of wheat from Lyallpur district on the ground that the same was needed by the -Government for its own purposes. Finding it impossible to export ·the wheat to Simla, the defendant proposed to the plaintiff to sell the wheat to some niill-owner at Lyallpur in case the Govern- ment did not requisition it. The defendant intended and proposed to send Rs. 10,000/- to the plaintiff on realising the sale proceeds .. of the wheat. The plaintiff sent no instructions and the Govern- ment did not purchase the wheat. The wheat was looted by fren- _zied mob during communal disturbances. The defendant thereafter migrated to India.

In this :respect we. 'find that sub-clause (I) of\" Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1908· reads as. under:~ \"In computing the period of Limitation prescribed for any suit the tiine during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or in a court of appeal, against the defendant, shall be excluded, where ~he procee- ding is founded upon the same cause of action and- is pro-• secuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it.\" The wording of clause (1) of Section 14 of the Limitation Ac1! of 1963 is the same as in the old Act except that the word \"pres- cribed\" occurring after the words '\"period of limitation\" has been. omitted, the words \"or of appeal or revision\" have been substi- tuted for the words \"or in a Court of appeal\" and the wordS-- \"relates to the same matter in issue\"· have replaced the words- \"founded on the same cause of action\". Section 14 has been enacted with the object of affording protection against the bar of limitation to a person in good faith cfoing his best to get his. case tried on the merits but failing through the Court being un- ale to give him such a . trial. It is intended to provide relief to one who initiates proceedings which by reason of some technical defect are thrown out. Such a party is given the right to exclude the· time spent over infructuous proceedings in computing the period of limitation for filing the suit; it provides for cases where a. plaintiff in absolute good faith but under a mistaken notion sues. in a wrong Court. Dealing with the above section their Lordships. of the Judicial Committee observed in the case of Ramdutt Rama- kissen Dass v. E.D. Sassoon & Co., (1) :- \"It. may be assumed that it had been ascertained before these provisions were formulated· that there · was a serious risk of injustice arising if the period of limita- tion, which is in many cases shorter than in England, should be too strictly applied.

It is urged that the above principle of English Law is not applicable . in India for t_he purpose of determining the lo~l jurisdiction of the Courts. Reference in this connection is made to S. Niranjan Slll:gh v. Jagjit Singh and another, (2), wherein it is observed that the common-law rule of England that a deb- tor must seek a creditor for -payment, though applicable in India, does not apply for the purposes of determining '.the forum where the suit is to be instituted. Similar view was expressed in Full Bench . case Firm Hira Lal Girdhari Lal and another v. Ba_ij Nath Hardial Khatri, (3). The above cited cases, in our opinion, are not· of much ~vail to the defendant-appellant because, as observed above, the plaintiff did not merely rely upon the fac- tum of his residence in Simla but sought to confer jurisdiction on the Simla Court by relying in addition upon the letters sent by the defendant. On behalr'of the appellant, reference has been made to the case of Sham Lal and others v. Bainka Mai and others (4). In that suit the plaintiffs, who were residing at Khurja in Aligarh District, owned a share in partnership business managed by the defendants at Hansi. On March 31, 1904 the plaintiffs brought a suit in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Aligarh, for recovery of money due on account of their share of profits. •It was alleged by the plaintiffs that there was an agreement between the parties· by which paintiffs' profit share was to be paid to them at K.hurja and the plaintiffs were receiving their share at Khurja. The Subordinate Judge held that the agreement alleged by the plaintiffs was not proved and that the suit was not cognizable by his Court. The decision of the Subordinate Judge was affirmed on appeal by the High Court. The plaint was returned to the plaintiffs and was presented to the Court of District Judge, Hissar, in which district the defendants carried on their business. It was held that the suit was not prosecuted in good faith in the Aligarh Co~ within .the meaning of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, and as · such the plaintiffs could not invoke the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act. In our opinion,_ the defendant-appellant cannot derive much assistance from the above authority because perusal of the facts of that case goes to show that the only evi- dence in_ support of the alleged agreement set up by the plaintiffs was the oral statement of one of the plaintiffs. In the present case, apart from the oral statement of the plaintiff we find there was documentary evidence, referred to above, on which -the plaintiff relied and according to which the., defendant undertook to remit the money to Simla.. ' · Another case, referred to on behalf of the defendant-appellant, is Dina Nath v. Munshi Ram and others, (5). The said case has again no bearing ·because in that case· the legal adviser · of the· A B- :: . C: .

It was held that the mistake was such that if the legal adviser A had only taken the trouble of looking up any elementary book on Court fees and Suits Valuation Act, he would have discovered it. No question of bona jide mistake or good faith was held to arise in the circumstances. Lastly, reference has been made on behalf of the defendant-appellant to the case of Firm Bansi Dhar Baldev Pershad and another v. Firm Alopi Pershad and Sons Ltd., B , (6). This again is a case of which the facts are clearly distinguish- able as the previous suit had been instituted in the K.hem Karan Court. while according to the agreement between the parties, the Delhi Court alone had jurisdiction. C D E F G H We, therefore, see no cogent ground to interfere with the finding of the Court below that the plaintiff was entitled to invoke the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act. It has next been argued that the Delhi Court had no jurisdiction to try the suit. In this respect we find that Banwari Lal, partner of the defendant-firm through whom the defendant was sued, is admittedly carrying on business at Delhi. Banwari Lal, when appt!aring as a witness, has deposed that Ganga Ram too was a partner of the defendant-firm. Ganga Ram died at Amritsar in September, 1947 and on his death the defendant-firm stood dis..:· solved. No plea was, however, taken in the written statement that Ganga Ram was a partner of the defendant-firm and on his death thelfirmlstoo.d dissolved. It may be mentioned that the Senior Subordinate Judge, Simla, while holding that the Court at Simla had no jurisdiction, gave a finding that it was the Court in Delhi which had jurisdiction in the matter. Be that as it may, the objection about the lack of territorial jurisdiction in Delhi would have no force in appeal unless it is shown that there has been a consequent failure of justice. Section 21 of, the Code of Civil procedure expressly pro- vides that no objection as to the place of suing shall be allowed by any Appellate or Revisional Court unless such objection was taken in the court of first instance at the earliest possible opportunity, and unless there has been a consequent failure of justice. As there is nothing to show that there has been any failure of justice because of the trial of the suit in Delhi, the objection about the lack of territorial jurisdiction of Delhi Court will have to be repelled. Lastly, it has been argued that the defendant-firm was acting as the agent of the plaintiff for the purchase of wheat. It is · urged that the defendant purchased the wheat in the account of the plaintiff and stored it at Abbaspur railway-station. The property in the said wheat had cousequently passed to the plaintiff. The wheat was thereafter taken possession of by the Pakistan authori- ties. The defendant-firm, in the circumstances, it is contended, is not liable to refund the money received by it.

It was, however, sought to show in evidence that the wheat had been taken possession of by the Pakistan authori- ties. The defendant in this connection examined two witnesses on commission in _Pakistan. One of the witnesses, namely, M_ian Nur Shah, Districti Food Controller, Lyallpur, did not give any material evidence on the point. The other witness was Chowdhry Mohammad Akram, District Food Controller, Lyallpur. According to this witness, 443 bags of wheat containing 1205 maunds 31 seers and l O chhatanks were taken over into the provincial reserve at Lyallpur. The price of the said wheat amounting to Rs. 9,830/3/3 was transferred to the Deputy Rehabilitation Com- missioner, Lyallpur, in the account of Pacca Arhti's Association, Abbaspur, on May 23, 1949. It is not shown as to how the state- ment of the above witness can be held to relate to the wheat which was to be purchased by the defendant on behalf of the plaintiff because the weight of that wheat was 1400 maunds. Chowdhry Mohammad Akram makes it clear that the permit in respect of that wheat was not in the name of the defei;tdant but in the name of Pacca Arhti's Association, Abbaspur. It is also clear from the question asked on behalf of the defendant- appellant in the interrogatories issued for the examination of · Chowdhry Mohammad Akram that the wheat taken into posses- sions by the Pakistan authorities was intended to be despatched not to the plaintiff-firm but to firm Dayalu Ram Mast Ram of Simla .. Two very material documents, of which note has to be made, are the letters dated August 11, 1947 and August 22, 1947 addressed by the defendant to the plaintiff. These letters have already been reproduced above and in those letters the defendant clearly undertook to remit the amount of Rs. 10,000/- to the plaintiff. If the wheat had been purchased by the defendant in the account of the plaintiff, it is not likely that the defendant would have been ready and willing to refund the amount of Rs. 10,000/- to the plaintiff. We, therefore, have no hesitation in repelling the contention of the defendant-appellant that the property in 1400 maunds of wheat had passed to the plaintiff and it would be the plaintiff-firm who would have to bear the loss on account of the taking into possession of the wheat by the Pakistan authorities. The appeal consequently fails and is dismissed with costs. Appeal dismissed. A.N.K. A B C D E F G , \\","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
