The material portion of the Recorder's iudgment was as J.C. follows :- 1894 ABDOOL RAZACK V. 57 '' The fir::;t point to consider is whether there was a marriage between Mah Thai and Abdul Hadee. It is not disputed that AGA before there can be a valid marriage between a Mahomedan and MAHOMED , ]AFFER a woman who is not a Kitabi,' the woman must be c:>nYerted to BINDANEEM. Mahomedanism (see Tagore Leet. 1873, p. 305). .Uah Tl,ai's evidence as to the marriage is, that she was in an inner room, that she heard voices in the outer room, and some one asked her if she loved Abdul Hadee, and consented to the marriage ? Then she \"·as asked ' Was anything said about religion ?' and she replied, ' My husband said something which I did not under• stand. Abdul Hadee said he would marry me according to Kala custom. I agreed.' Then, in cross-examination, she said : ' I said he would ha,·e to give dower according to custom among Kalas. I did not understand; but it was said it must be accord- ing to Kala custom, and so I said he must giYe dower according to Kala custom. I !mow nothing aboul the Mahomedan religion. I have all my life liYed and worshipped as a Burman. While cohabiting with Abd11l Hadee I worshipped as he did. As a long time has elapsed, I ha\\·e forgotten. I could repeat after him ; but have forgolten now. He repeated his prayers in some Kala language ; I don't know what language. I repeated in the language he used ; I did not understand the meaning of a single word ... I knov,; there is a Mahornedan mosque here. I wasn't allowed to go to it ; I had to stop at home. I knm\\· that wi \\'es of Moguls go to the mosque: I didn't go, because Abdul Hadec would not allow me to go. I said I wanted to go; but he wouldn't allow me.' Then, in re-examination, she said that she ceased to be a Buddhist during her cohabitation with Abd11l Hadee from the time of her marriage; and that, being the wife of a Kala, she followed the Kala religion. This is all the e,·idence as to conversion, and I do not see how, on such evidence, it can be held that Mali Thai was converted to Mahomedanism. It would, it seems to me, be a mere mockery of the Maholl7edan religion to say that there was a conversion, when there was not even a semblance of discussion on the subject, when no priest intervened, and when the utmost the alleged convert can sm· is, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Indian Appeals, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.

This alone would be sufficient to shew that no vali<l marriage could have taken place. But the other e\\·idence goes to shew that ,Uali Thai could not have been married to Abdul Hadee. AGA MAHoMED \"I think then that the Plaintiff Abdul Razack has not succeeded JAPFER in proving that his mother, Mah Thai, \\Yas converted to the BINDANEEM. Mahomedan religion at the time of the alleged marriage, and that, as she was not a ' Kilabi ', no valid marriage could have taken place between her and Abdul Hadee ; not only this, but Mah Thai admittedly hacl, before going to live with Abdul Hadee, been married according to Burmese law, and the e,·idence that she was ever divorced resls only on her unsupported statement. Hov,:ever, I do not lay much stress upon this, but go on this ground-that, assuming for the sake of argument tbat .\\lalz Thai did live with Abdul Hadee at the tillle she says she did, and that the Plaintiff is her son by Abdttl Hadee, yet, that not having been converted to Mahomedanism, she could not ha,e been legally married to Abdul Hadee. If I am right in this ,iew, then it follows, according to the decision of the Allahabad Court in .Hulwtnmad Allahdad Khan , . . Huhammad Ismail [{/ian (1), that no acknowledgment on the part of the father could legitimatise the offspring of such an union . . Uahmood, J., points out that·, according to Mahon .e<lan law, so far as inheritance from males or through rnales is concerned, the e);istence of legitimacy of descent or consanguinity is a condition precedent to the right of inherit- ance, and that such legitimacy depends upon a \\·alid marriage or connec'ion Letween the parents of the inheritor. Further, that in no case can an illegiiimate child inherit, and that where a marriage is not possible l.etween the parenb, acknowledgments cannot make the off::,pring of the union legi limate. He al;;o points out Iha' the Mahornedan law of arkno,de<lgrnent of parentage with i ls legitin·a ing effect, has no reference whate,-er to cases in which the illegitin.acy of the child is proyed and established, either by reason of a lawful union between the parents of the child being impossible, as, in my opinion, is the case here, or, by reasons of marriage necessary to render the child legitimate being disproved.

'' This view, if I may say so, appears to me to be clearly right. Otherwise, if the proposition that acknowledg·ment alone is suffi- cient to establish legitimacy is correct, these results must neces- sarily follow : that a Maliomedan may legitimatise the offspring of adulterous or incestu o us intercourse, or even a person of wholll h~ could not possibly have been the father-for exan1ple, to put an extreme case, a person older than himself.

The learned Recorder found that there was no marriage, holding upon the evidence that Mah Thai was not a com-ert to Mahomedanism. ''It would, it seems to me,\" he observed, \"be a mere mockery of the Mahomedan religion to say that there was a conversion, when there \\\\'as not even a semblance of dis- cussion on the subject, when no priest intervened, and when the utmost the alleged convert can say is, that she repeated prayers in a language she did not understand.\" Taking this view, he thought it unnecessary to consider the e,·idence ac; to acknow- ledgment. No acknowleclgment in hi s opinion could confer the status of legitimacy upon the offspring of a Mahomedan and an unconverted Buddhist. The learned Counsel for the Appellant took exception to the proposition upon which the Recorder's ruling seems to be based. It was a mistake, they said, to talk of con\\·ersion. No Court can test or gauge the sinceri v of religious belief. In all cases where, according to Mahomedan law, unbelief or difference of creed is a bar to marriage with a true believer, it is enough if the alien in religion embraces the Mahomedan faith.

In the next place, it was urged that e\\·ery presumption ought __ lo be made in favour of marriage when there had been a lengthened cohabitation, especially in a case where the alleged marriage took place so long ag-o that it must be difficult if not impossible ~o obtain a trust worthy account of what really occurred. There would be much force in this argument-indeed, it would be almost irresistible-if the conduct of the parties were shewn lo be compatible with t1 e existence of the relation of husband and wife. In cases like the present conduct is a ,·ery good test, and a safer guide than the recollection or imagination of interested or biased witnesses. Mah Thai's own account of the way in which she was treated may he accepted as a fairly truthful story, considering her relationship to the claimant, anJ the facl that she is speaking of what occurred many years ago. The alleged marriage took place somewhere about the year 1854. If that date is correct the connection between her and her alleged husband ceased in 1856, though Abdul Hadee did not leaye Ra!lR,<>011 for good until more than twenty years afterwards. The marriage was proposed to her, she says, by a married sister of hers who was living in Rangoon, and who sent for her from her na:ive village-a place called Ma11gi, about half a day's journey off. She had already been married once, but that marriage was dissolved by mutual consent-. Ahd11l Hadee was brought for her to see. She asked him if he would look after her and cohabit with her for a long time, and he said he would. He came four or fi\\·e times before the marriage. He said he would invite his male relatives, but he was not going to invite his female relatives. At the marriage some money and a ring were put into her hands as dower; with that part of the ceremony she seems to have been previously acquainted, and to have been careful to insist upon it ; and her consent to the un1on appears to ha\\·e been given in due form. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Indian Appeals, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.

On the first occasion Jlah Thai says she saw Ahdul Hadee alone, hut nothing in particular was said. He wrote on a piece of paper a Mah 0111eclan name for the child. Afterwards, for fear it would be lo:=:.t, it was copied on a palm leaf. The name was never used. The paper and the palm leaf have disappeared. But .Hah Tli,li says the name was Abdool Razack, and that name has been reproduced or adopted in connection with this claim. On the second occasion, according to Jlah Thai's statement, Abdul Hadee wanted to take the child to Rangooll, and wanted her to go with him. She said she was not well yet and that the child was not old enough. That \\\\\"as the last occasion on which Jlah Thai sa\\\\. Abdul Hrrdee. So far as appears she never even heard from him or of him afterwards. He was at that time apparently in prosperous circumstances, but he made no provision for her or for the child, and he left the child to be brought up as an unbelie',er wilhoul so much as performing, the primary rite of his religion. 51/ ah Thai was very badly off, but she never applied to her alleged husband for assistance, nor did she make any attempt to see him, though she knew where he lived, and lie had, she said, 1,een kind to her ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Indian Appeals, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.

At the end of two years, or four years as she says in one place, she married a Burman by ,vhom she lrn.d se,·en children. Then she divorced him, and at the time of the trial she appeared as the wife or partner of a fourth consort. Abdul Hadee continued to reside in Ra11Roon for a good many years, paying occasional visits to Calcutta. After a time he mel with reverses ancl left Ranf!,0011 altogether. The last years of his life he spent at Ca!c11tta, living ac; a pensioner on the bounty of his brother, Hadjee Hoosain.

After stating as a matter apparently not open to controversy that, in order to constitute a \\·alid IJ'arriage between a Mussulman and a Burmese woman, the woman must firsl apostatize and embrace Islam, the judgment proceeds as follows ;- \" In a country like this, where a large number of Mahomedans from other countrie~ have taken up their residence, and in very J. c. 1894 67 ABDOOL RAZACX V.

R. many cases their permanent abode, and when the natives have no race prejudices against alliances with foreigners, and whose religion offers no impediment to such, we find these mixed marriages everywhere existing among them, which have been duly celebrated according to Mahomedan rites ; the wife having MAHOMED previously JAFFER B1NDANEEM. husband. renounced her own religion and embraced that of her Such an alliance is not regarded by either party as temporary character, or in any way partaking of one of a concubinage such as the liaisons which at one time pre\\·ailed here between Europeans and the women of the country, but as a formal and a binding marriage. I l only requires a short experience of this country to know that these marriages are regarded amongst the Mahomedan communit.y as being of as binding a character, and as conferring on the wife as honorable a position in the family as if she had been of Mahomedan descent: for she holds the same position as the husband's other wife does, if he happens lo have another. The offspring likewise of these m'1.rriages are brought up in the Mahomedan faith, and are acknowledged by their father as his legitimate children, and at his death share in his property as such. The Burmese wife also takes the wife's share, if she is the only one, or divides it with the other or others as the case may be ; ancl these rights both as regards the children and the wife are recognized by our Courts.'' If this be a correct description of the position of a Burmese woman lawfolly married to a Mahomedan settler in Rangooii it certainly would require a very violent presumption in favour of marriage to enable the Court to hold that .\\lah Thai was lawfully wedded to Abdul Hadee. It is tolerably ob\\'ious that neither Abdul Hadee nor Mah Thai regarded the ceremony which preceded their cohabitation in the light of a lawful and binding marriage. On this point their Lordships are glad to find themselves entirely in accord with the Court below. The only question remaining for consideration is the question of acknowledgment, with which the learned Recorder dealt in rather a summary way. The learned counsel for the Respondent did not deny that Abdul Hadee might ha\\·e married .Hah Thm', as no doubt he might have done if she had embraced Islam, nor ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Indian Appeals, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.

Their contention was that there was no acknowledgment in the legal and proper sense of the word, although there may have been an admission of paternity. The learned counsel for the Appellant cited various texts, which taken apart from the context would seem to shew that any admission of paternity, though made casually and not intended to have a serious effect, would be sufficient to confer the status of legitimacy. It is not in their Lordships' opinion necessary to examine these ancient authorities, or to inquire how far they are applicable to a state of society very different from that which existed at the time when they were promulgated. Their Lordships are bound by the decision of this Board, which is clear upon the point. The question arose in the case of Asht\"ufood Dowlah Ahmed Hossein Khan v. Hydet\" Hos!lein Khan (1). There it was contended that the claimant, who was defendant in the suit and respondent on the appeal, had been acknowledged by his putative father. The fact of acknowledgment was denied by the appellant. And a deed of repudiation was set up, in which the father expressly repudiated the claimant as his son. An issue was framed in these terms : \" Has the deed of repudia- tion the effect of cancelling previous acknowledgment of defendant's legitimacy, if such were made ? \" In the course of their judgment (p. 104) their Lordships comment upon that issue. It was, they said, \" very correctly framed. It substitutes for the ambiguous word ' sonship,' which might include an illegitimate son, the word ' legitimacy,' and uses 1.he word ' acknowledgment ' in its legal sense, under the Mahomedan law, of acknowledgment of antecedent right established by the acknowledgment on the acknowledger, that is, in the sense of a recognition, not simply of sonship, but of legitimacy as a son.'• It is clear that it is in that sense that the term \" acknowledg- ment \" is used in a later passage of the judgment which has often been cited, where their Lordships say, \" a child born out of wedlock is illegitimate ; if acknowledged, he acquires the status of legitimacy. vVhen, therefore, a child really illegitimate by (1) 11 Moore's Ind, Ap.
