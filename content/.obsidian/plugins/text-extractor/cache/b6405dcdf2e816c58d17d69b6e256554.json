UNION OF INDIA 227 - In the present case, the submission that contracts entered into by the Union of India in the name of the President of India are immune from provisions that protect against conflict of interest of a party to a contract, under S. 12(5), rejected - Constitution of India, Art. 299 (Paras 12 to 16) The Ministry of Home Affairs (Procurement Division) (\"the respondent\") floated a single party tender on 2-2-2011 for supply of 31,756 Glock Pistols. The bid was confirmed in favour of the applicant and a acceptance of tender was issued by the respondent on 31-3-2011. Disputes having arisen, the applicant issued a notice invoking arbitration on 20-7-2022, and nominated a retired Judge of the High Court of Delhi as the sole arbitrator. The respondent was called upon to accept the nomination within 15 days. Replying to the notice invoking arbitration, the respondent by a letter dated 3-10-2022, stated that the nomination was contrary to Clause 28 of the conditions of tender, as per which disputes are to be referred to arbitration by an officer in the Ministry of Law, appointed by the Secretary of Ministry of Home Affairs. The issues involved in this matter were: (1) Whether the respondent, Union of India, being a party to the agreement, appointing its own employee, an officer in the Ministry of Law, as d the sole arbitrator would conflict with the mandate of Section 12(5) read with Schedule VII Para 1 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (\"the Act\")? e f g h (2) Whether contracts entered into by the Union of India in the name of the President of India are immune from provisions that protect against conflict of interest of a party to a contract, under Section 12(5) of the Act? Allowing the present application under Section 11(6), the Supreme Court Held: Re: Submission regarding contracts expressed in the name of the President of India Article 299 of the Constitution provides that all contracts made in exercise of the executive power of the Union shall be expressed to be made in the name of the President. The phrase \"expressed to be made\" and the word \"executed\" are intended to mean that there must be a deed or contract, in writing, and executed by a person duly authorised by the President or the Governor in that behalf. (Para 12) The rationale of Article 299( 1) is that there must be a definite procedure according to which contracts must be made by the agents of the Government in order to bind the Government, otherwise public funds may deplete by unauthorised or illegitimate contracts. It implies that contracts not couched in the particular form stipulated by Article 299(1) of the Constitution cannot be enforced at the instance of any contracting party. (Para 13) It must be emphasised that Article 299 only lays down the formality that is necessary to bind the Government with contractual liability. It is important to note that Article 299 does not lay down the substantial law relating to the contractual liability of the Government, which is to be found in the general laws of the land.

(Para 15) Re: Conflict of the arbitration clause with Section 12(5) read with Schedule VII Para 1 of the Act The arbitration clause enables the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, to appoint an arbitrator for the resolution of disputes arising out of this contract. The Ministry of Home Affairs is a party to the contract. The arbitration clause enables the Secretary representing the Ministry to appoint an officer in the Ministry of Law as the arbitrator. In other words, the proposed arbitrator would be an employee of the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India, and at the same time, the appointing authority, the Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, is also an employee of the Government of India. (Para 17) State of Assam v. Kanak Chandra Dutta, 1966 SCC OnLine SC 9, considered The 246th Law Commission Report which reflected on the issue of contracts with State entities and observed that when the party appointing an arbitrator is the State, the duty to appoint an impartial and independent adjudicator is even more onerous.

As the statutory mandate of Section 12(5) of the Act is to apply \"notwithstanding any prior agreement\", Clause 28 of the Agreement (Conditions of Tender) falls foul of Schedule VII Para 1 to the Act. (Para 19) In a case where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the course for dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the dispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator. (Para 20) Perkins Eastman Architects DPC v.

The applicant issued a notice invoking arbitration on 20-7-2022, and nominated a retired Judge of the High Court of Delhi as the sole arbitrator. The respondent was called upon to accept the nomination within 15 days. Replying to the notice invoking arbitration, the respondent by a letter dated 3-10-2022, stated that the nomination was contrary to Clause 28 of the conditions of tender, as per which disputes are to be referred to arbitration by an officer in the Ministry of Law, appointed by the Secretary of Ministry of Home Affairs. 6. Clause 28 is as under: \"28.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 232 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) s sec Submissions 8. Mr Ramak:rishnan Viraraghavan, learned Senior Advocate, along with Mr Shayam D. Nandan, AOR appearing for the applicant, submitted that appointment of the sole arbitrator as per the respondent's letter dated 3-10-2022 would be contrary to Section 12(5) of the Act. For this purpose, he also relied on the judgment of this Court in Perkins Eastman Architects DPC v. HSCC ( India) Ltd. 2 The objection is simply that the respondent, Union of India, being a party to the agreement, appointing its own employee, an officer in the Ministry of Law, as the sole arbitrator would conflict with the mandate of Section 12(5) of the Act. 9. Ms Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the respondent, submitted that the judgment in Perkins2 would have no application to the facts of the present case. She would point out that the contract in the present case, unlike in Perkins2 , is in the name of the President of India, and that is a clear point of distinction. The learned ASG also relied on Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. Raja Transport ( P) Ltd. 3 to contend that once a party enters into an agreement for the appointment of a person as an arbitrator, it cannot simply opt out of the arbitration clause. In the alternative, the ASG also relied on the decision of this Court in Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. ECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML (JV) 4, where appointment of a panel of arbitrators by the Ministry of Railways was held to be valid. She would, therefore, contend that the power to nominate an officer in the Ministry of Law is not in conflict with Section 12(5) of the Act. Analysis 10. As the objection about appointment of the arbitrator as per Clause 28 of the conditions of tender is based on the statutory prohibition under Section 12( 5) of the Act, we will reproduce relevant part of the section for ready reference: \"12. Grounds of challenge.-(1) When a person is approached in connection with his possible appointment as an arbitrator, he shall disclose in writing any circumstances- (2)-(4) * * * * * * (5) Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall a b C d e f be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator: g Provided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-section by an express agreement in writing.\" ( emphasis supplied) 2 (2020) 20 sec 160 3 (2009) s sec s20 : (2009) 3 sec (Civ) 460 4 c2020) 14 sec 112 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The arbitrator is an employee, consultant, advisor or has any other past or present business relationship with a party.\" Re: Submission regarding contracts expressed in the name of the President b of India C d e f 12. We will first deal with the submission of the learned ASG, Ms Bhati that the contract in the present case stands on a different footing as it is entered into in the name of the President of India. Article 299 of the Constitution of India5 provides that all contracts made in exercise of the executive power of the Union shall be expressed to be made in the name of the President. The phrase \"expressed to be made\" and the word \"executed\" are intended to mean that there must be a deed or contract, in writing, and executed by a person duly authorised by the President or the Governor in that behalf. 13. The rationale of Article 299( 1 ), as explained in Chatturbhuj Vithaldas Jasani v. Moreshwar Parashram6 is that there must be a definite procedure according to which contracts must be made by the agents of the Government in order to bind the Government, otherwise public funds may deplete by unauthorised or illegitimate contracts. It implies that contracts not couched in the particular form stipulated by Article 299( 1) of the Constitution cannot be enforced at the instance of any contracting party. 14. It must be emphasised that Article 299 only lays down the formality that is necessary to bind the Government with contractual liability. It is important to note that Article 299 does not lay down the substantial law relating to the contractual liability of the Government, which is to be found in the general laws of the land. It is for this reason that, even though a contract may be formally 5 \"299. Contracts.-(l) All contracts made in the exercise of the executive power of the Union or of a State shall be expressed to be made by the President, or by the Governor of the State, as the case may be, and all such contracts and all assurances g of property made in the exercise of that power shall be executed on behalf of the President or the Governor by such persons and in such manner as he may direct or authorise.

Having considered the purpose and object of Article 299, we are of a the clear opinion that a contract entered into in the name of the President of India, cannot and will not create an immunity against the application of any statutory prescription imposing conditions on parties to an agreement, when the Government chooses to enter into a contract. We are unable to trace any immunity arising out of Article 299, to support the contention that for contracts expressed to be made by the President of India, the ineligibility of appointment b as an arbitrator as contemplated under Section 12(5) of the Act, read with Schedule VII, will be inapplicable. 16. We have no hesitation in rejecting the submission of the learned ASG that the contracts entered into by the Union of India in the name of the President of India are immune from the provisions that protect against conflict of interest of a party to a contract, under Section 12(5) of the Act. Re: Conflict of the arbitration clause with Section 12(5) read with Schedule VII Para 1 of the Act 17. The tender Notice dated 2-2-2011 was issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs for the purchase of Glock pistols. The applicant's bid was accepted on 31-3-2011 as per the Terms and Conditions contained in Tender No. D/21013/30/3218/2-ll-2011/PW 3. The said Terms and Conditions specifically provided for Arbitration as per Clause 28 of the Schedule appended to the Tender. The arbitration clause enables the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, to appoint an arbitrator for the resolution of disputes arising out of this contract. The Ministry of Home Affairs is a party to the contract. The arbitration clause enables the Secretary representing the Ministry to appoint an officer in the Ministry of Law as the arbitrator. In other words, the proposed arbitrator would be an employee of the Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India, and at the same time, the appointing authority, the Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, is also an employee of the Government of India. 8 7 See Chatturbhuj Vithaldas Jasani v.

In this very context, we can beneficially refer to the recommendation of the 246th Law Commission Report which reflected on the issue of contracts with State entities and observed that when the party appointing an arbitrator is the State, the duty to appoint an impartial and independent adjudicator is even more onerous. Their deliberations and recommendations, which led to the introduction of Section 12(5) with the Seventh Schedule in the Act, are extracted as follows: \"56. The limits of this provision have been tested in the Indian Supreme Court in the context of contracts with State entities naming particular persons/designations (associated with that entity) as a potential arbitrator. It appears to be settled by a series of decisions of the Supreme Court [See State of Odisha v. Gangaram Chhapolia9 ; State of T.N. v. Munuswamy Mudaliar 10 ; International Airports Authority v. K.D. Bali11 ; S. Rajan v. State of Kerala 12 ; Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Inda Swiss Synthetics Gem Mfg. Co. Ltd. 13 ; Union of India v. M.P. Gupta 14 and ACE Pipeline Contracts (P) Ltd. v. Bharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. 15 ] that arbitration agreements in government contracts which provide for arbitration by a serving employee of the department, are valid and enforceable. While the Supreme Court, in Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. Raja Transport ( P) Ltd. 3 carved out a minor exception in situations when the arbitrator 'was the controlling or dealing authority in regard to the subject contract or if he is a direct subordinate (as contrasted from an officer of an inferior rank in some other department) to the officer whose decision is the subject-matter of the dispute', and this exception was used by the Supreme Court in Denel ( Pty) Ltd. v. Union of India 16 and Bipromasz Bipron Trading SA v. Bharat Electronics Ltd. 17, to appoint an independent arbitrator under Section 11, this is not enough. 57. The balance between procedural fairness and binding nature of these contracts, appears to have been tilted in favour of the latter by the Supreme Court, and the Commission believes the present position of law is far from satisfactory. Since the principles of impartiality and independence cannot be discarded at any stage of the proceedings, specifically at the stage of constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, it would be incongruous to say that party autonomy can be exercised in complete disregard of these principles - even if the same has been agreed prior to the disputes having arisen between the parties. There are certain minimum levels of independence and impartiality that should be required of the arbitral process regardless 9 (1984) 3 sec 627 10 1988 Supp sec 651 11 (1988)2SCC360 12 (1992) 3 sec 608 13 (1996) 1 sec 54 14 (2004) 10 sec 504 15 (2001) 5 sec 304 3 (2009) 8 sec 520: (2009) 3 sec (Civ) 460 16 (2012) 2 sec 759: (2012) 2 sec (Civ) 37 17 (2012) 6 sec 384: (2012) 3 sec (Civ) 102 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

A sensible law cannot, for instance, permit appointment of an arbitrator who is himself a party to the dispute, or who is employed by ( or similarly dependent on) one party, even if this is what the parties agreed. The Commission hastens to add that Mr P.K. Malhotra, the ex officio member of the Law Commission suggested having an exception for the State, and allow State parties to appoint employee arbitrators. The Commission is of the opinion that, on this issue, there cannot be any distinction between State and non-State parties. The concept a of party autonomy cannot be stretched to a point where it negates the very basis of having impartial and independent adjudicators for resolution of b disputes. In fact, when the party appointing an adjudicator is the State, the duty to appoint an impartial and independent adjudicator is that much more onerous - and the right to natural justice cannot be said to have been waived only on the basis of a \"prior\" agreement between the parties at the time of the contract and before arising of the disputes.\" ( emphasis supplied) 19. Following the recommendation of the Law Commission, sub-section (5) to Section 12 was inserted to the Act with effect from 23-10-2015. As the statutory mandate of Section 12(5) of the Act is to apply \"notwithstanding any prior agreement\", Clause 28 of the Agreement (Conditions of Tender) falls foul C of Schedule VII Para 1 to the Act. d 20. In Perkins2 , this Court held that any person who has an interest in the outcome of the dispute would be ineligible to be an arbitrator. Naturally, such a person should not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator. The relevant portion of this judgment is as under: (SCC p. 779, para 21) \"21. But, in our view that has to be the logical deduction from TRF Ltd. 18 Para 50 of the decision shows that this Court was concerned with the issue, 'whether the Managing Director, after becoming ineligible by operation of law, is he still eligible to nominate an arbitrator'. The ineligibility referred to therein, was as a result of operation of law, in that a person having an interest in the dispute or in the outcome or decision thereof, must not only be ineligible to act as an arbitrator but must also not be eligible to appoint anyone else as an arbitrator and that such person cannot and should not have any role in charting out any course to the dispute resolution by having the power to appoint an arbitrator. The next sentences in the paragraph, further show that cases where both the parties could nominate respective arbitrators of their choice were found to be completely a different situation. The reason is clear that whatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice would get counter-balanced by equal power with the other party. But, in a case where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the course for dispute resolution.

That has to be taken as the essence of the amendments brought in by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (3 of 2016) and recognised by the decision of this Court in TRF18.\" (emphasis supplied) 21. In conclusion, the arbitration clause which authorises the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, whose relationship with the Union oflndia is that of an employee, to nominate an officer of the Ministry of Law and Justice to act as a sole arbitrator, clearly falls within the expressly ineligible category provided in Schedule VII Para 1, read with Section 12(5) of the Act. As the grounds of challenge to the appointment of an arbitrator under Section 12(5) of the Act operate notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, we cannot give effect to the appointment of an officer of the Ministry of Law and Justice as an arbitrator. The submission of the learned ASG in favour of such an appointment is therefore rejected. Re: Reliance on the decision in Central Organisation for Railway Electrification 4 22. We will now deal with the last limb of the learned ASG's submissions, which relates to the precedent of Central Organisation for Railway Electrification4. In this case, Clause 64(3)(b) provided for the constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal consisting of three members. The appointment procedure contemplated was such that the General Manager of the appellant was required to nominate the panel of four retired railway officers, out of which the respondent Contractor had to select two names. The General Manager was required to appoint at least one out of the selected officers as the contractor's nominee arbitrator(s), and unilaterally appoint the remaining arbitrators as well as the Presiding Officer to the Tribunal. The decision of Perkins2 was not applicable therein as the contract contemplated a three-member Arbitral Tribunal, while Perkins2 applies to cases of unilateral appointment of sole arbitrators. Further, the Court noted that, \"absolutely, there is no bar under Section 12(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 for appointment of a retired employee to act as an arbitrator\"4. The Court in Central Organisation for Railway Electrification4 also relied on the principle elucidated in Voestalpine Schienen GmbH v. Delhi Metro Rail Corpn. Ltd. 19 wherein DMRC nominated a five-member panel comprising names of employees of Railways, Central Public Works Department or public sector undertakings and the Court upheld the nomination inter alia noting that empanelling of such retired persons was intended to utilise their technical 18 TRF Ltd. v.

As held in Voestalpine Schienen GmbH19 , the very reason for empanelling the retired railway officers is to ensure that the technical aspects of the dispute are suitably resolved by utilising their expertise when they act as arbitrators. Merely because the panel of the arbitrators are the retired employees who have worked in the Railways, it does not make them ineligible to act as the arbitrators.\" (emphasis supplied) 23. In contrast, the arbitration clause in the present case enables a serving employee of the Union of India, a party to the contract, to nominate a serving employee of the Union of India as the sole arbitrator. Such an authorisation 20 Id, paras 24 and 26: [Voestalpine Schienen GmbH v. Delhi Metro Rail Corpn. Ltd., (2017) 4 sec 665 at pp. 688-89] \"24 . ...

If this contention of the petitioner is accepted, then no person who had earlier worked in any capacity with the Central Government or other autonomous or public sector undertakings, would be eligible to act as an arbitrator even when he is not even remotely connected with the party in question, like DMRC in this case. The amended provision puts an embargo on a person to act as an arbitrator, who is the employee of the party to the dispute. It also deprives a person to act as an arbitrator if he had been the consultant or the advisor or had any past or present business relationship with DMRC. No such case is made out by the petitioner. * * * 26. It cannot be said that simply because the person is a retired officer who retired from the Government or other statutory corporation or public sector undertaking and had no connection with DMRC (the party in dispute), he would be treated as ineligible to act as an arbitrator. Had this been the intention of the legislature, the Seventh Schedule would have covered such persons as well. Bias or even real likelihood of bias cannot be attributed to such highly qualified and experienced persons, simply on the ground that they served the Central Government or PSUs, even when they had no connection with DMRC. The very reason for empanelling these persons is to ensure that technical aspects of the dispute are suitably resolved by utilising their expertise when they act as arbitrators. It may also be mentioned herein that the Law Commission had proposed the incorporation of the Schedule which was drawn from the red and orange list of IBA guidelines on conflict of interest in international arbitration with the observation that the same would be treated as the guide 'to determine whether circumstances exist which give rise to such justifiable doubts'. Such persons do not get covered by red or orange list of IBA guidelines either.\" (emphasis supplied) 4 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v.
