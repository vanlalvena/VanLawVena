Civil Procedure Code, 1908 - Or. 11 Rr. 1 to 11 - Interrogatories - Purpose - Held, is to shorten the litigation process by requiring the opposite party to pointedly make its position clear on the disputed issues - This limits the scope of cross-examination also - Liberal use of interrogatories - Held, should be allowed unless an interrogatory falls into an excepted categories like unreasonable, vexatious, etc. (R. 3) - On facts held, interrogatories were wrongly disallowed - In a suit for recovery of bank deposits, interrogatories raised on banking procedures and practices - Further held, proposed interrogatories were relevant - They ought not to have been disallowed Allowing the petitions, the High Court of Delhi Held: While deciding the said application under Order 11 Rule 1 CPC, the trial court has only to consider whether answer to the said interrogatories would have some bearing on the issues involved in the case and whether the same could be necessary for fair adjudication of the dispute. The very object of the interrogatories is to know the case of the opposite party. This shortens the trial and limits the scope of the cross-examination. The courts should be liberal and should not be hyper technical in allowing the use of interrogatories in a suit. Interrogatories also enable a party to obtain an admission from the opponent, which reduces the scope of trial and the cost of litigation. Once the Court concluded that the interrogatories are relevant for proper adjudication of the case, the interrogatories are served upon the other party and the other party must answer the interrogatories on affidavit or objections can be raised on the ground that the interrogatories are scandalous in nature or are not relevant or not bona fide for the purposes of the suit or on the ground of privilege. The objections on the grounds above must be taken on affidavit. It is at that stage that the Court considers which of the questions in the interrogatories, the party should be compelled to answer.

Shanti Devi, 1996 AIHC 3391, relied on The interrogatories sought to be served by the petitioner on Respondents 1 and 2 were germane for adjudication of the suit. Seeing the nature of relief sought in the suit viz. rendition of account of the fixed deposits made in the name of the petitioner, the information/documents sought by the petitioner on such deposits were relevant for the issues to be decided in the suit. The information sought by way of interrogatories on the procedure to be followed by the bank for change in the nature of account or adding a nominee to the FDR is also very relevant in the light of the allegations in the plaint that the said fixed deposit was illegally tampered with and the name of Respondent 1 was wrongly added. (Para 25) The trial court failed to appreciate that the cross-examination may not be necessary considering the answers given to the interrogatories. It is not the case of the respondents that any of the interrogatories are scandalous in nature or are irrelevant. When the tests of relevancy and expediency are applied to the facts of the case, it leaves no doubt that the interrogatories should have been allowed and would have helped in reducing the time taken in trial. (Para 26) B. Civil Procedure Code, 1908 - Or. 11 Rr. 12 and 13 - Discovery of Documents - When application ought to be allowed - Opposite side's plea that documents were not available or destroyed - Held, court may issue production order notwithstanding such plea - Once demand for production is declined on affidavit, the requisitioning party would have choice to take further steps as available under law Held: The discovery and production of documents sought, are relevant in the context of the suit and for adjudication of the suit. Even if the defence of the respondents of not having the documents in their possession and/or destruction of the documents is considered, the same would have to be stated by them on oath in terms of Order 11 Rule 13 CPC. It would then for the petitioner to take any such further steps as may be available in law. (Para 31) M. Sivasamy v. Vestergaard Frandsen, 2009 SCC OnLine Del 2310; M.L. Sethi v.

Thereafter, an application (IA No. 15125 of 2015) was filed on behalf of the petitioner and Respondents 3 and 4 under Order 11 Rule 1 CPC seeking leave of the Court to administer interrogatories on Respondents 1 and 2. Details of the interrogatories were provided in Para 7 of the application and it was pleaded that the said interrogatories were very necessary to establish that the FDR had been illegally tampered with and overwritten, that the name of Respondent 1 was added later as a joint holder and that the nature of the account was changed. 11. All the aforesaid applications were contested by Respondents 1 and 2. It was stated by Respondent 1 that all papers in possession of Respondent 1 were handed over to the petitioner vide letter dated 19-4-2010 and that Respondent 1 did not have any further documents in her possession. Respondent 2 Bank, in its reply to the aforesaid applications, contended that by way of the afore said applications, the petitioner is collecting evidence and making fishing and roving enquiry. Hence, both the respondents sought dismissal of the aforesaid applications. 12. The learned trial court, vide impugned order dated 10-7-2017 dismissed IA No. 15125 of2015 filed under Order 11 Rule 1 CPC for leave to administer interrogatories, by holding that (i) the relief of rendition of accounts has to be proved through evidence and not by extracting evidence by way of e interrogatories; (ii) the petitioner is seeking to collect evidence and information amounting to admission of the parties by way of interrogatories which is not permissible; (iii) the application under Order 11 Rule 1 CPC has been filed after completion of pleadings and framing of issues; and (iv) the parties cannot be asked to make admissions through interrogatories. 13.

Further, various judgments cited before the learned trial court by the petitioner have not been discussed at all in the impugned orders. Learned counsel relies upon the judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Canara Bank v. Rajiv Tyagi & Assn. 1 and judgment of the Bombay High Court in Narain Ramchandra Bakhle v. Govind Datta Bakhle 2 to contend that the only test to be applied while deciding an application under Order 11 Rule 1 CPC is the relevancy of the documents for deciding the suit. It is contended that Respondent 1 has admitted in the written statement that she has in her possession the documents of Late Mrs Veena Paintal. 16. Per contra, counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent 1 submits that the FDR in respect of which tampering is alleged is already on record. He further submits that in the statement given by Respondent 1 before the trial court on 23-12-2019, it has already been stated that all papers pertaining to the subject-matter of the suit have already been handed over to the petitioner vide letter dated 19-4-2010 and there are no further documents in possession of the said respondent. The counsel appearing for Respondent 2 Bank submits that the present petition is highly belated and draws attention of the Court to the order dated 31-5-2019 in CM(M) No. 925 of2019 3 where at the time of issuing notice on the present petition it was stated that the notice would be without prejudice to the contentions of the respondent with regard to maintainability of the petition. He draws attention to the reply to IA No. 15124 of2015 on behalf of Respondent 2 Bank before the trial court wherein it is stated that in June 2013 a fire broke out at the Vasant Vihar Branch of the bank in which the documents in respect of which discovery was sought under the aforesaid application, were destroyed. He further submits that information was provided to the petitioner as far back in 2013 and the copy of the FDR, allegedly tampered with, was also provided to the petitioner and after that it is for the petitioner to prove allegation of tampering. 17. In rejoinder, the counsel for the petitioner submits that even if it is the case of the respondents that the documents have been destroyed or are not available, the same should be stated on oath so that the petitioner can take other steps as may be permissible in law. 18. Undoubtedly, there is a delay in filing CM(M) No. 925 of 20193, but keeping in mind the important questions of law involved in the present petitions, the present petitions cannot be held to be not maintainable on account of delay. In any event, remedy under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is a discretionary remedy and there is no prescribed period of limitation provided. 19. Coming to the merits of the petitions, this Court is of the view that the reasoning given by the trial court in both the aforesaid impugned orders under challenge in the present petitions are not tenable in law. 20.

Rules 1 to 10 of Order 11 CPC provide a complete code with regard to interrogatories. The said provisions prescribe the entire procedure from the time an application seeking leave of the Court to deliver interrogatories is filed. The aforesaid provisions of the CPC with regard to interrogatories have been propounded by this Court in a series of judgments. In Sharda Dhir v. Ashok Kumar Makhija4 , it was observed as under: \"JO. As observed above at the preliminary stage of hearing on the application the court is required to decide whether the applicant should be allowed to interrogate the other side, but is not to determine what question should the opposite party be compelled to answer. Interrogatories may then be served on the other party for his answer to that on affidavit. The party, who has been served with interrogatories, will then answer the interrogatories on affidavit or raise objections about the relevancy or they being of scandalous nature, irrelevant, not bona fide, or not to be answered on the ground of privilege, etc., in answer. The court then may consider and dispose of the interrogatories. It will not for the court at this stage of granting leave to consider what particular questions the party interrogated should be compelled to answer. Proper time for considering that question is after the party interrogated has filed its affidavit in answer.\" 21. The counsel for the petitioner has correctly relied upon the judgment of this Court in Canara Bank case 1, wherein, in a similar factual background, following observations were made by the Court: \"6. The reasoning given by the trial court for dismissal of the application is certainly not tenable in law. Merely because the interrogatories could form the question which could be put in cross- examination is no basis for denying the interrogatories. Certainly, whatever can form the subject-matter of interrogatories can form the subject-matter of cross-examination. But notwithstanding the same a provision therefor has been made in the CPC. The interrogatories are aimed at facilitating proof of the case and to save the costs which may be incurred in adducing evidence to prove the necessary facts. Cross-examination may not be necessary in view of the replies to the interrogatories. Thus, the test to be applied in dealing with an application for discovery by interrogatories is not whether it can form subject-matter of cross-examination or not but is of relevancy and expediency. 7 .... The question between the parties is thus of accounts. The queries/ questions with respect to such accounts are best answered by delivery of interrogatories. If such queries, were to be made in cross-examination, the witness/plaintiff may not be in a position to answer the same immediately, for non-availability of requisite material. The same would result either in the cross-examination being deferred leading to delays and costs or to evasive answers. On the contrary, interrogatories can be answered by the party at its leisure and after perusing all records available at its office/ 4 2002 SCC OnLine Del 688 l Canara Bank v.

Answers to the interrogatories will also lead to reduction in the time taken by the court in recording cross- examination and help in crystallising the cross-examination.\" 22. The present suit was filed for recovery and rendition of accounts, as was the case in Canara Bank case 1. Therefore, the above quoted observations given in Canara Bank case 1 would be applicable in the present case as well. 23. Reference may also be made to a subsequent judgment of this Court in Transport Corpn. of India Ltd. v. RBI5 wherein while following the dicta in Sharda Dhir case4 , A.K. Aggarwal v. Shanti Devi 6 and Canara Bank case 1 it was observed as follows: \"20. The Court is not, at this stage, to examine as to what would be the impact of the answer of the interrogatories. The Court, at the stage of administration of interrogatories, has to only consider whether the answer to the interrogatories would have some bearings on the issues involved in the case and as to whether they relate to any matter in question to the suit. The law with regard to the interrogatories is well settled. 21. The provisions of Order 11 CPC are intended to curtail evidence thereby expediting trial of suit, saving time of the Court and costs of litigation to the parties. They have to be liberally used and parties have to be encouraged to use them in the course of trial. One of the great objects of interrogatories when properly administered has always been to save evidence that is to diminish the burden of proof which was otherwise on the plaintiff. Their object is not merely to discover facts which will inform the plaintiff as to evidence to be obtained, but also to save the expense of proving a part on the case. Interrogatories are not limited to giving the plaintiff a knowledge on that which he does not already know but include the getting an admission of anything which he has to prove on any issue which is raised between him and the defendant. Ref Attorney-General v. Gaskill7. Order 11 gives a party a right to interrogate with a view to obtaining an admission from his opponent of everything which is material and relevant to the issue raised on the pleadings. The object is to obtain an admission from the opponent which will make the burden of proof easier than it otherwise would have been. Interrogatories are admissible which go to support the applicant's case or to impeach or destroy the opponent's case. Ref: Plymouth Mutual Coop. Society v. Traders Publishing Assn. 8. 22. Answers to the interrogatories would lead to reduction in the time taken by the court in recording cross-examination and help in crystallising the cross-examination.

The court should not be hyper technical at the stage of serving the interrogatories. The only defence to service of interrogatories can be when the same do not relate to the matter in question or are scandalous. 23. Administering of interrogatories is to be encouraged as it is a means of obtaining admissions of parties and tends to shorten litigation. As a general rule the interrogatory should be allowed, whether the answer to the m would either strengthen the case of the party administering them or to destroy the case of the adversary. The court should not be hyper technical at the stage of the service of the interrogatories. This rule is to be used liberally whenever it could shorten the litigation and serve the interest of justice. 24. When the interrogatories proposed to be administered are examined in the light of the above referred legal propositions, it is clear that answer to the interrogatories may have the effect of shortening the litigation.\" 24. When examined in the light of parameters laid down in the aforesaid judgments, clearly, the trial court has misdirected itself in rejecting the application filed by the petitioner under Order 11 Rule 1 CPC. While deciding the said application under Order 11 Rule 1 CPC, the trial court had to only consider whether answer to the said interrogatories would have some bearing on the issues involved in the case and whether the same could be necessary for fair adjudication of the dispute. The very object of the interrogatories is to know the case of the opposite party and to, therefore, shorten the trial and limit the scope of the cross-examination. The Courts should be liberal and should not be hyper technical in allowing the use of interrogatories in a suit. Interrogatories also enable a party to obtain an admission from the opponent, which reduces the scope of trial and the cost of litigation for the parties. Once the Court comes to the conclusion that the interrogatories are relevant for proper adjudication of the case, the interrogatories are served upon the other party and the said other party has to answer the interrogatories on affidavit or objections can be raised on the ground that the said interrogatories are scandalous in nature or are not relevant or not bona fide for the purposes of the suit or on the ground of privilege. The objections on the grounds above have to be taken on affidavit. It is at that stage that the Court has to consider which of the questions in the interrogatories the party should be compelled to answer. 25. In the present case, the approach followed by the trial court in dismissing the application filed by the petitioner was completely flawed. No exercise has been undertaken to determine whether the interrogatories sought to be delivered on the respondents are relevant or necessary for fair and proper adjudication of the case. This Court is of the view that the interrogatories sought to be served by the petitioner on Respondents 1 and 2 were germane for adjudication of the suit. Seeing the nature of relief sought in the suit viz. rendition of account with regard to the various fixed deposits made by Late Mrs Veena Paintal in the name of the petitioner, the information/documents sought by the petitioner with regard to such deposits were relevant for the issues to ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: High Court Cases (Del)™, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.

The information sought by way of interrogatories with regard to procedure to be followed by the bank for change in the nature of account or adding a nominee to the FDR is also very relevant in the light of the allegations in the plaint that the said fixed deposit was illegally tampered with and the name of R e spondent 1 was wrongly added. 26. The only basis provided by the trial court for not allowing the application of the petitioner was that the interrogatories could be put in cross-examination. The learned trial court failed to appreciate that the cross-examination may not be necessary in light of the answers given to the interrogatories. It is not the case of the respondents that any of the interrogatories are scandalous in nature or are irrelevant. When the aforesaid tests of \"relevancy\" and \"expediency\" are applied to the facts of the case, there is no doubt in the mind of the Court that interrogatories as sought to be raised in the present case should have been allowed and would have helped in reducing the time taken in trial. 27. It is unfortunate that the adjudication of the said applications has taken so much time and delayed the adjudication of the suit for almost four years when such an application ought to have been allowed immediately. In fact, Order 11 Rule 2 CPC provides that the Court will decide the said application within seven days of filing of the said application. 28. The impugned order dated 11-2-2020 while dismissing the application under Order 11 Rules 12 and 13 CPC for discovery and production of documents, is completely premised on the basis that the trial court was deciding applications under Order 11 Rule 1 CPC for leave to administer interrogatories. In this regard reference may be made to the following paragraphs: \"6. It is needless to point out that the purpo se of providing the procedure of discovery by interrogatories in the Code of Civil Procedure is to shorten the litigation or at least save the time and expenses connected therewith. It enables a party to obtain an admission from the opponent which renders his burden of proof a bit lighter. The second proviso to Rule 1 of Order 11 uses the expression 'matters in question', which expression has its own significance and importance. The expression 'matters' means a question or i ssue in dispute or in action and not the thing about which such dispute arises. The object of the provision is to secure all material documents and to put an end to lengthy enquiry with regard to document/ material in possession of the other party. There are however limits to the utilities of the power to order interrogatories to be answered. Those limits are set by the rules of relevancy, by the demands of decency and propriety, and by the even wider basic requirements of fair play, justice and equity. For example, although one of the object of the interrogatories is to ascertain an adversary's case, yet they cannot be permitted to be used by a party, merely to obtain any disclosure beforehand of evidence supporting the adversary's case as this would give one party an unfair advantage over the other. 7. The Court can allow service of interrogatories, at any stage of the suit, for which it has been conferred wider discretion, but at the same time, the discretion must be exercised in a judicious way.

In the light of the pleadings, I observe that prayer asking for documents by such interrogatories deserve to be disallowed since all questions relating to the FDRs/changes and alterations/alleged removal of documents by Defendants 1 including other documents based on which plaintiff has confined her case are the questions which can be proved or established only by way of evidence or cross-examination. Under the cloak of the provisions of Order 11, plaintiffs cannot be permitted to have roving or fishing inquiries in respect of matters which are not germane for the proceedings and delivery of interrogatories cannot be a substitute for leading evidence by the plaintiffs. This is why Rule 1 of Order 11 has been stringed with a proviso to the effect that the questions which may be relevant for cross-examining the witness may not be covered through interrogatories. 10. Pertinently, the issues were framed by Hon'ble Delhi High Court on 27-5-2015 and since then not a single witness has been examined by the plaintiffs as per list of witnesses. The applications in fact seek the collection of evidence in the garb of Order 11 which amounts to a roving inquiry into the issues, which are to be proved by the plaintiffs through evidence. In such a situation the applications filed by the plaintiffs serving of interrogatories and seeking answers thereof would rather protract the proceedings in a matter which pertains to the year 2013.\" 29. Reference to the paras above shows that the entire discussion in the said impugned order is with regard to the scope of interrogatories. There is no discussion on the provisions in the CPC with regard to the discovery and production of documents. In fact, the learned trial court has also referred to provisions of Order 11 Rule 1 CPC in reaching its conclusion, completely overlooking the fact that the two applications being decided by the said impugned order were actually applications under Order 11 Rules 12 and 13 CPC for discovery and production of documents. This shows the complete non-application of mind by the trial court, and the said order deserves to be set aside on the said ground alone. 30. A Division Bench of this Court in M. Sivasamy v. Vestergaard Frandsen 9 relying upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in M.L. Sethi v. R.P. Kapur 10 , while construing the scope of Order 11 Rule 12, has observed as under: \"(i) The documents sought to be discovered and produced have to be relevant to the matter in controversy viz. matters in question. (ii) The documents have to be in the possession and power of the person against whom discovery and production is sought. 9 2009 SCC OnLine Del 2310: (2009) 113 DRJ 820 10 (1972) 2 sec 427 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: High Court Cases (Del)™, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt.

(iv) The discovery and production is necessary for fairly disposing of the suit or for saving costs. ( v) The discovery and production may be general or limited to certain classes of documents as the Court in its discretion deems fit and the production will only be ordered if the Court considers it just.\" 31. Applying the aforesaid parameters to the present case, in the considered view of this Court, the discovery and production of documents sought in the aforesaid applications are relevant in the context of the suit and for adjudication of the suit. Even if the defence of the respondents of not having the documents in their possession and/or destruction of the documents is taken into account, the same would have to be stated by them on oath in terms of Order 11 Rule 13 CPC and thereafter, it is for the petitioner to take any such further steps as may be available to her in law. 32. In view of the above, both the present petitions are allowed and the impugned orders dated 10-7-2017 and 11-2-2020 are set aside. Respondents 1 and 2 are directed to answer the interrogatories by filing an affidavit in terms of Order 11 Rules 8 and 9 CPC within four weeks from today. Similarly, Respondents 1 and 2 will file an affidavit in terms of Order 11 Rule 13 CPC in respect of documents sought to be produced in IA Nos. 6763 of 2013 and 15124 of 2015, within four weeks from today. Thereafter, the trial court would proceed with the matter in light of observations made above. a b C d e f g h","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
