Without going into the question whether the appeal was maintainable or not, in our view, appropriate course to be adopted in the matter is to effectuate the understanding as culled out in Para 10 of the consent terms. If the parties had a arrived at a settlement and decided to withdraw the cases filed by each of the parties against the other, the compromise ought to be effectuated in complete sense. 6. The law on the point is well-settled by the decision of this Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab 3 • Leaving aside the technicalities, we therefore deem it appropriate to quash the proceedings which were initiated at the instance of the respondent wife i.e. FIR No. 148 of 2015 dated 4-9-2015 registered with Police Station Pathri District Parbhani. Further proceedings in said FIR now stand quashed. 7. Before we part with, we must also express our reservation insofar as Para 6 is concerned, which was incorporated in the order on 8-11-2017 by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Aurangabad. It was certainly open to the wife to give up any claim so far as maintenance or permanent alimony or stridhan is concerned but she could not have given up the rights which vest in the daughter insofar as maintenance and other issues are concerned. 8. We, therefore, exercising our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, set aside Para 6 of the consent terms. Rest of the order stands unaltered and ought to be given effect to. 9. With the aforesaid view, the appeals stand allowed to the aforesaid extent. We express our sincere gratitude to Mr Santosh Paul, Senior Advocate and Ms Rukmini Bobde, Advocate for their able assistance as Amicus Curiae in the matter. 3 c2012) 10 sec 303: c2012) 4 sec (Civ) 1188: (2013) 1 sec (Cri) 160: c2012) 2 sec (L&S) 988 b C d e f g h","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
