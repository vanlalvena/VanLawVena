Shortly after the boy's birth, Kn:AN namely, in August, 1906, Khushdil Khan stated on Mun:~.m oath th'.l.t he had get a son. This meant the appellant, IBRAHIM KHAN.: who was his only son at the time.

The presump- tion in favour of legitimacy arising from continuous cohabitation over a pe.r10d of years is one which is based on public policy, and in the case of M uham- madans, no doubt, on the well-known doctrine of lvlu- hammadan law, which abhors bastardy. ln a family like the present, however, which pays scant regard to the matrimonial tie in the begetting of children from women of low caste, the presumption, in my opinion, must be so small as to be practically negligible. lt might operate as a factor to turn the scale where the evidence for and against a marriage is equal, but It is not sufficient to transfer from a claimant son some obligation to prove his own legitimacy. ~o the burcten of proof may be regarded as being equally distributed over the parties.\" The Board think it right to say at once that it can give no countenance to the doctrine here set forth. It amounts to this, that the proof as to whether there was a marriage between two parties is to include a consideration of the character and conduct of vari- ous relatives; an estimate is to be formed! as to 1vhether on the whole these relatives prefer the tie of concubinage to that of marriage.

Each case of each of these relatives would Mu~MAD have required to be separately investigated on its lnRAHIM K.IIAN. own merits : without that, the way is opened! for family gossip on a wide scale, prompted by motives unknown and knowledge untested. A further suggestion of which their Lordships cannot approve appears to amoun.t to this: that a court of law on eviden.ce such as is given here would pro- nounce a view to the effect tha.t there was a clan pro- ·cli'dty towards concubinage rather than marriage, and therefore that marriage and the legal presump- tions in favour of it cannot be sustained. Their Lordships think it right further to say that the evidence on this subject should not have been allowed by the District Judge. He attached no weight to it himself, but it was not only without weight, it was without competence. It remains to be added that undoubted difficulty arises in the case on account of the fact that the mother of the appellant was not a parda nashin lady. The other wives lived behind the pa.rda according to the well-known ~1uhammadan habit. They were strict :ifuhammadans, young persons brought from Afgha- nista.n.
