CHOWDHARY 305 and magnitude of the crime or the manner in which the crime was com- mitted and other attending circumstances may be relevant as prima facie grounds to have a fresh look to cancel the bail. The grounds for cancella- tion of the bail in Chapter XXXIII are, dehors the merits in the matter, namely, necessity due to the conduct of the accused and abuse of liberty i.e. obstruction of the smooth investigation or suborning witnesses or attempting to tamper the evidence, threatening the witnesses with dire consequences or making or attempting to remove himself beyond the reach of the court to hamper the smooth trial, etc. are independent of the merits in the matter. Cancellation of the bail would be necessitated by the conduct of the accused himself after the release. I agree with brother Punchhi, J. that it might be possible to abuse the proviso by deliberate delay in completing the investigation to facilitate the release of the accused on bail. I also agree that merits brought out in the charge- sheet and attending circumstances are relevant, as the bail was granted due: to default of the investigating officer without court's adverting to the medts but strong grounds are necessary to cancel the bail. To that extent brother Ahmadi, J. also laid emphasis, namely, strong grounds are to be made out in the charge-sheet. With respect I agree with brother Ahmadi's emphasis that filing the charge-sheet (challan) itself is not suf- ficient. However, I lay emphasis that the High Court or the Court of Ses- sions should consider the merits of the case. With respect, KJ. Shetty, J., laid emphasis on the subsequent filing of the charge-sheet and the power for cancellation under Sections 437 and 439 of the Code. Unfortunately, the ratio in Parida 1 and Bashir cases was not brought to the notice of the learned Judge, which was directly on the point and for the reasons stated I find it difficult to agree with the learned Judge in that respect. I am in full agreement with the view expressed by brother Ahmadi, J. and the order proposed by him. (1992) 4 Supreme Court Cases 305 (8EFORES. RATNAVELPANDIAN AND K JAYACHANDRAREDDY,JJ.)

Bofors of Sweden on March 24, 1986, pursuant to a contract for supply of 410 numbers of 155 mm Field Howitzer 77-B gun system/spare guns for a total amount of SEK 8410.66 miHion (Swedish Kroners) (equivalent of about Rs 1437.72 Crores). Sub- sequ1ently the Swedish Radio gave a broadcast that bribes had been paid to senior Indian politicians and key Defence personnel to secure the contract. Some leading newspapers gave prominent coverage to the radio broadcast. This led 10 a storm of controversies in both the Houses of Parliament. A Joint Par- liamentary Committee was set up for making inquiry into the matter. The JPC, however, inter alia found that there was no evidence to establish that any pay- ment had been made by Bofors for winning the contract or that the Bofors pay- ment involved a violation of any Indian law. In spite of this conclusion of the JPC.. allegations of malpractices in the deal with Bofors, payments of kickbacks and receipt of illegal gratification were persistently reiterated and the matter was relently agitated. Meanwhile, there was a change of Government. The CBI then~upon on the basis of reliable information registered an FIR on Jan. 22, 1990 under Ss. 120-B r/w Ss. 161, 162, 163, 164 and 165-A IPC and Sec- tions 5(2), 5(1)(d) and 5(2)/5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The core of the allega- tions in the FIR was that the accused, named and unnamed, entered into a criminal conspirac...1, obtained illegal gratification in the form of money from Bofors, the Swedish company, through the agent/firms/companies/persons as motive or reward for such public servants who by corrupt or illegal means or by olherwise dishonestly using their official position as public servants caused p(!cuniary advantage to themselves, Bofors, the agents and others in awarding contracts to Bofors for the supply of guns to the Government of India and in the transaction committed the offences of criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery and using of forged documents. The CBI commenced its investigation and moved an application before the Special Judge requesting to issue a letter rogatory/request to Switzerland urgently for getting the necessary assistance so that the investigation can be conducted in Switzerland lest very important and relevant evidence would remain uncollected and the cause of justice would be frustrated. The Special Judge allowed the application. However, the letter rogatory was sent back by the order of the Cantonal Court of Geneva for com- pliance of certain procedural formalities. It was at this relevant time that Shri H.S. Chowdhary, an advocate claiming to be the General Secretary of an organisation named as Rashtriya Jan Parishad which according to him, is devoted to \"uphold the Rule of Law, fight against injustice in any field and abide by the Constitution and respect ideals and institutions\" filed a criminal miscellaneous case before the Special Court under Art. 51-A The grounds taken in the petition were that \"in order to maintain the dignity, prestige and th1! fair name of the country and the ideals enshrined in the Constitution no rogatory letter be issued on the formal request of the CBI unless the allegations against named persons are established to the satisfaction of this Hon'ble Court\"; that \"no request for rogatory or freezing bank account be made to Swiss Government unless the concerned persons are noticed and heard on the subject\"; that \"the petitioner may be permitted to join during inquiry before this Hon'ble Court in the capacity of public interest litigant\"; that \"inquiry under Section 340 Criminal Procedure Code be held to determine the alleged offence committed by various persons and till then proceedings of rogatory be stopped\". The Special Judge dismissed the petition taking the view inter alia that the petitioner had no locus standi. Shri Chowdhary then filed a criminal revision before the High Court of Delhi under Sections 397 /482, CrPC raising multiple questions of law challenging the legality and validity of not only the impugned order but also the very registration of the FIR and the investigation carried thereon by the CBI. A Single Judge of the High Court held that the petitioner had no locus standi and therefore the revision petition was not maintainable. However, the Judge observed: \"This is not the end of the matter. There is yet another process by which the court can take judicial notice of any illegality being committed by any court, with a view to prevent the injury being calllsed to the known or unknown aggrieved party\". Accordingly, the Single Juclge, finding several illegalities in the trial (See para 36) suo motu took cog- nizance under Sections 397 and 401 read with Section 482, CrPC, and directed a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Consequently the Single Judge called upon the CBI and the State to show cause as to why the proceedings initiated on filing of FIR pending in the Court of Special Judge, be not quashed. Hence the appeals. The Supreme Court was called upon to examine the tenability of the reasons given by the High Court as regards the locus standi of Mr H.S. Chowdhary and in addition, the invocation of the suo motu action of the High Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. Dismissing the appeals, the Supreme Court in its earlier order dated Aug. 27, 1991 ((1991) 3 SCC 756) expressed only its conclusions reserving the reasons to be given later. The Supreme Court's conclusions were mainly two- (1) The advocate, Mr H.S. Chowdhary had no locus standi to file the petition and the initiation of the proceedings under Article 51-A could not come within the true meaning and scope of public interest litigation. Consequently, the appellants namely, Janata Dai, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Indian Congress (Socialist) and others equally have no right of seeking their impleadment/intetvention. (2) The suo motu action of the Single Judge of High Court in exercise of the powers undt~r Sections 397 and 401 read with Section 482 of the Code could not be sustained. Consequently, the directions of the Single Judge calling upon the CBI and the State to show cause could not also be sustained. In the result while agreeing with the first part of the order of the High Court the Supreme Court quashed the second part of the impugned order. In the present judgment the Court now rendered the reasons for the above conclu- sions. I. LOCUS STANDI IN PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION Constitution of India -Arts. 32 and 51-A - Public interest litigation - Meaning and relevance- Words and phrases - 'litigation', 'PIL' The expression 'litigation' means a legal action including all proceedings thert:in, initiated in a court of law with the purpose of enforcing a right or seek- ing a remedy. Therefore, lexically the expression 'PIL' means a legal action initiated in a court of law for the enforcement of public interest or general interest in which the public or a class of the community have pecuniary interest or some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected. The defini- tion of PIL emerged from historical context in which the commonality of the various forms of legal representation involving the basic and fundamental rights of a significant segment of the public demanding vindication of its rights has been recognised in various parts of the world. The concept of PIL which has been and is being fostered by judicial activism has become an increasingly important one setting up valuable and respectable records, especially in the arena of constitutional and legal treatment for 'the unrepresented and under- represented'.

The dominant object of PIL is to ensure observance of the provisions of the Constitution or the law which can be best achieved to advance the cause of community or disadvantaged groups and individuals or public interest by pt;:rmitting any person, acting bona fide and having sufficient interest in maintaining an action for judicial redress for public injury to put the judicial machinery in motion like actio popularis of Roman Law whereby any citizen d could bring such an action in respect of a public delict. The Supreme Court has widely enlarged the scope of PIL by relaxing and liberalising the rule of stand- ing by treating letters or petitions sent by any person or association complain- ing violation of any fundamental rights and also entertaining writ petitions filed under Article 32 by public-spirited and policy-oriented activist persons or journalists or of any organisation rejecting serious challenges made with regard e to the maintainability of such petitions and rendered many virtuosic pronoun- cements and issued manifold directions to the Central and the State Govern- mt'.nts, all local and other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India for the betterment of the public at large in many fields in conformity with constitutional prescriptions of what constitutes f the good life in a socially just democracy.

Union of India, AIR 1982 SC 149: 1981 Supp SCC 87, explained and relied on However, only a person acting bona fide and having sufficient interest in the proceeding of PIL will alone have a locus standi and can approach the court for the poor and needy, suffering from violation of their fundamental rights. But a person for personal gain or private profit or political motive or any obli- qu,e consideration has no locus standi. Similarly, a vexatious petition under the colour of PIL brought before the court for vindicating any personal grievance, deserves rejection at the threshold. The Court should not allow its process to be abused by mere busybodies, meddlesome interlopers, wayfarers or officious interveners having absolutely no public interest except for personal gain or private profit either for themselves or as proxy of others or for any other extraneous motivation or for glare of publicity. But this does not mean there is any retreating or recoiling from the earlier views expressed by the Supreme Court about the philosophy of public interest litigation. (Paras 109 to 112) In this case 'not even a single ray of the characteristic of public interest litigation is visibly seen' in the petitions of Shri H.S. Chowdhary. He appears to be very much concerned with the personal and private interest of the accused in the: criminal case. It cannot be said that this litigation is in the nature of PIL to vindicate and effectuate the public interest. Therefore, Shri Chowdhary has no locus standi to file the petition or to invoke the revisional or extraordinary inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under Sections 397 and 482, CrPC respectively and the petition under Article 51-A of the Constitution cannot come within the true meaning and scope of public interest litigation.

CRIMINAL REVISION AND INHERENT POWER OF HIGH COURT Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - S. 397 - Revision - Scope of discre- tionary power of High Court Under Section 397, the High Court possesses the general power of super- intendence over the actions of courts subordinate to it which discretionary power when administered on administration side, is known as the power of superintendence and on the judicial side as the power of revision. In exercise of the discretionary powers conferred on the High Court under the provisions of this section, the High Court can, at any stage, on its own motion, if it so desires and certainly when illegalities and irregularities resulting in injustice are brought to its notice, call for the records and examine them.

(Para 128) Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - S. 401 - Revisional jurisdiction of High Court - Object and scope The object of the revisional jurisdiction under Section 401 is to confer power upon superior criminal courts - a kind of paternal or supervisory juris- diction - in order to correct miscarriage of justice arising from misconception of law, irregularity of procedure, neglect of proper precaution or apparent har- shness of treatment which has resulted, on the one hand, or on the other hand in s.ome underserved hardship to individuals. The controlling power of the High 0)urt is discretionary and it must be exercised in the interest of justice with regard to all facts and circumstances of each particular case, anxious attention being given to the said facts and circumstances which vary greatly from case to ~~ ~~1~ Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - S. 482 - Inherent power of High Court - Scope - How and when should be exercised - Not to be resorted to if there is any specific provision in the Code for redressal - It should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution - It should be exercised cautiously ex debito jw,titiae - On facts, the suo motu quashing of the FIR and the investigation was improper and uncalled for Held: Section 482 which corresponds to Section 561-A of the old Code and to Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code proceeds on the same principle and deals with the inherent powers of the High Court. The rule of inherent powers has its sourU! in the maxim \"Quadolex aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur id sine quo ipsa, ess uon potest\" which means that when the law gives anything to anyone, it gives also all those things without which the thing itself could not exist. (Para 131) The criminal courts are clothed with inherent power to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice. Such powerthough unrestricted and undefined should not be capriciously or arbitrarily exercised, but should be exercised in appropriate cases, ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial jusllice for the adminisllration of which alone the courts exist. The powers pos- sessed by the High Court under Section 482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the power requires great caution in its exercise. Courts must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles. (Para 132) The inherent power under this section can be exercised by the High Court (1) to give effect to any order passed under the Code; or(2) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court; or (3) otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The power is not to be resorted to if there is a specific provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of the aggrieved party. It should not be exercised as agailnst the express bar of law engrafted in any other provision of the Code.

Once an investigation by the police is ordered by a Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Code, the Magistrate cannot place any limitations or direct the officer conducting it as to how to conduct the investiga- tion.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by b S. RATNAVEL PANDIAN, J.-We gave our conclusions in our earlier order dated August 27, 1991 1 reserving the reasons to be given later. Accordingly, we render our reasons in the present judgment. 2. We feel that a prefatory note, though not the detailed facts of the case, is necessary for disposal of these appeals and writ petition. The c facts culled out from various documents placed before this Court are as follows: 3. The Ministry of Defence, Government of India approved in August 1980 a proposal forwarded by Army Headquarters (HQ) recom- mending, inter alia, the introduction of 155 mm calibre medium guns d both towed and self-propelled to meet its defence operational require- ments. The choice for obtaining the said gun system/guns was short-listed in December 1982 to (1) M/s Sofma of France, (2) M/s AB. Bofors of Sweden (briefly called 'Bofors'), (3) Mis International Military Services of U.K. and (4) Mis Yoest Alpine of Austria. In November 1985, there e was a further short-listing of Sofma and Bofors. Finally, the order was placed by the Government of India with Bofors on March 24, 1986 for the supply of 410 numbers (400 plus 10 free) of 155 mm Field Howitzer 77-B gun system/spare guns vide contract No. 6(9)/84/D (GS-IV) for a total amount of SEK 8410.66 million (Swedish Kroners) (equivalent to f about Rs 1437.72 crores or Rs 14377.2 million). The related contract for supplying the gun package (towed) and other related agree- ments/contracts were concluded and signed on March 24, 1986 with Mis A.B. Bofors. 4. On April 17, 1987, some leading newspapers of our country gave prominent coverage to a Swedish Radio Broadcast made in the previous daly, broadcasting that bribes had been paid to senior Indian politicians and key Defence figures to win the contract awarded by the Government of India to Mis Bofors of Sweden on March 24, 1986. 5. The Swedish Radio repeated the allegation on April 17, 1987 claiming that it had documentary proof of the pay-offs in four instal- m,;::nts to Indian accounts in Swiss Banks and it had checked with Skandinaviska Enskilds Banken, the bankers for Bofors.

CHOWDHARY (Pandian, l.) 315 hand, Bofors denied paying any kickbacks to Indian politicians or offi- cials for the deal involving the supply of 155 mm towed Howitzers and al5,o issued a statement on April 17, 1987 itself, which statement reads th1L1s: \"A.B. Bofors has not paid, or conspired to pay, any bribes in connection with the order. All allegations to the contrary are hereby categorically denied.\" 6. The Government of India on April 17, 1987 issued a statement denying the allegations contained in the news items based on the broad- cast report, made by the Swedish Radio and Television in connection with the arms order placed on Swedish firm, Bofors and categorised the news item as false, baseless and mischievous. The part of the said state- ment reads thus: \"Government's policy is not to permit any clandestine or irregular payments in contracts. Any breach of this policy by anyone will be most severely dealt with.\" d 1. On April 20, 1987, the Minister of Defence (Sri K.C. Pant) made a suo motu statement on the subject in Lok Sabha stating inter alia that on the eve of finalising the contract, in response to a reiteration of Gov- ernment's policy and a demand for confirmation, M/s Bofors had replied, vide their letter of March 10, 1986 that they did not employ any e Representative/Agent in India for the project. However, for administra- tive services, e.g. hotel bookings, transportation, forwarding of letters, telexes etc., they used the services of a local firm. 8. The Defence Minister further stated that \"if any evidence is produced involving violations of the law, the matter will be thoroughly f investigated and the guilty, whoever they may be, punished.\" g h 9. A similar statement was made by the Minister of State for Defence in Rajya Sabha on April 21, 1987. 10. This issue created a storm of controversies both in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Several issues were raised by the members in the respective Sabhas relating not only to the alleged kickbacks paid by M/s Bofors for winning the contract but also about the quality and suitability of the gun selected for procurement. 11. On April 20, 1987, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister intervening in the debates in the Lok Sabha stated: \" ... And like Panditji has said now, you show us any evidence, we do not want proof. We will bring the proof. You show us any evi- dence that there has been involvement of middlemen, of payoffs or of bribes or commissions, we will take action and we will see that nobody however high-up is allowed to go free.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The then Defence Minister following the assurance made by the then Prime Minister stated: \"The Prime Minister has already intervened on a number of a occasions and has said that there are no charges at the moment and if evidence is asked for then we shall look into it. We shall inquire into if and if somebody is found guilty we will punish him. This is the essence of what Members have been asking.\" 13. During the course of the discussion in Rajya Sabha and Lok b Sabha, several members demanded a probe with full details by a Par- liamentary Committee. When the matter stood thus on June 4, 1987, the Swedish Embassy in India, forwarded a copy of the report dated June 1, 1987 of the Swedish National Audit Bureau (SNAB for short) with a note to the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, stating c that what was made available to the Government of India was only one part of the Report of SNAB but not the report in its entirety and the rest was withheld by the Government of Sweden on the bank secrecy require- ments. The summary of the observations of the SNAB as extracted in the report of the JPC are as follows: d \" .... that an agreement exists between A.B. Bofors and ......... * concerning the settlement of commission subsequently to the FH 77 deal; and - that considerable amounts have been paid subsequently to, e among others, AB. Bofors' previous agent in India.\" (* Names not disclosed) 14. However, the report did not disclose the names of the recipients of kickbacks as indicated above. 15. This report of the SNAB (Swedish National Audit Bureau) was f discussed by the then Prime Minister with the leaders of the opposition parties on June 11, 1987. The Government decided to request the Spc:!aker, Lok Sabha and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha to set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee (hereinafter referred to as 'JPC') to enquire into and establish the identities of the persons who received the g payments. But the Speaker and the Chairman of the respective Sabhas declined to set up on their own the JPC to probe into the Bofors deal. Thc:!reupon, the then Prime Minister during his meeting with the leader of the opposition in Parliament on June 17, 1987 indicated that the Gov- ernment would move a motion in the Monsoon Session of Lok Sabha for h the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee to probe into the Bofors deal. Accordingly, the Minister of Defence (Shri K.C. Pant) moved a motion on July 29, 1987 in the Lok Sabha for appointment of the JPC. While moving the motion, the Minister on August 3, 1987 after recalling the whole sequence of events stated inter alia as follows: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

These are, firstly, that sizable pay- ments were made in 1986. It would also be seen that the most crucial portion of the Report, which contains particulars of the recipients of the amounts paid by Bofors, have not been disclosed to us.\" Hi. Further in justification of the constitution of JPC, the Defence Mmister added that \"The Government has nothing to hide. The Govern- m1;~nt wants to get at the truth and that is why this Committee has been set up.\" 1'7. Thereafter, certain substitute motions were moved by the Parlia- mc:::nt members and ultimately after a discussion in both the Houses, the JPC was constituted with the appointment of its Chairman on August 28, 1988 totally consisting of 30 elected members - 20 from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha for making inquiry into the following matters: (i) Whether the procedures laid down for the acquisition of weapons and systems, were adhered to in the purchase of the Bofors' gun; (ii) to ascertain the identity of the persons who received, and the purpose for which they received, payments of the following amounts: (a) SEK 170-250 million (b) SEK 29.5 million (c) SEK 2.5 million from M/s Bofors ( as referred to in the Report of the Swedish National Audit Bureau, received by the Government of India on June 4, 1987); (iii) arising out of the enquiry, if there is prima facie evidence that M/s Bofors have in addition to payments mentioned in (ii) above, made any other payments for securing the Indian contracts, the identity of the persons who received such payments shall be ascertained; (iv) to determine if any Indian laws/rules/regulations have been violated either by M/s Bofors or by persons as indicated in (ii) and (iii) above. 18,. Of the elected members, two members by name Shri Mahabir Prasad and Smt Sumati Oraon resigned w.e.f. March 16, 1988. One other membc:::r, Dr K.G. Adiyodi died and three other members of the Com- mittee ceased to be members of the Committee consequent on their retirement from Rajya Sabha w.e.f. April 2, 1988. In place of the mem- bers, who resigned and a member who died, three other members from the Lok Sabha were elected. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(xiv) There is no evidence of any other payment having been made by Bofors for winning the Indian contract.\" 20. One of the members gave his note of dissent disagreeing with th•e conclusions of the Committee. 21. Para 7.176 of the report of JPC reads as follows: a b \"7.176 The Committee note that during their discussions, in c September, 1987 with the Government of India team, the Bofors officials gave the following information regarding the names of com- panies and details of payments made to them by way of winding-l.!p charges: (i) SVENSKA INC.

SERVICES LTD., U.K. - SEK 50 million\" 22. It is further seen from the report of the JPC that Mr Lars e Gothlin, Chief Jurist and Senior Vice-President of the Noble Industries wa:§ examined by the JPC and during the examination his attention was drnwn to a statement of Mr Thunholm, Chairman of the Noble Industries, which is the holding company of M/s AB. Bofors that so far f as he was aware, payments had been made to Indians or to an Indian company in connection with the contract. Of course, the Chief Jurist finding himself in a piquant situation, said that the words of Dr Thun- holm were twisted. (Vide paras 7.41 and 7.56 of the report of JPC). 23. In spite of the conclusion in the report of the JPC, allegations of g malpractices in the deal with Bofors, payments of kickbacks and receipt of illegal gratification were persistently reiterated and the matter was relcntly agitated. Meanwhile, there was a change of Government.

Various allegations are made mention of in the FIR regarding the payments of bribes/kickbacks and receipt of illegal gratification, the debates made in the Parliament, the correspondences among the parties and the various findings of the JPC. It is further e averred in the first information report that even in the letter dated Octobe:r 3, 1986, sent to the Swedish National Bank, Bofors had referred to some of the payments to Svenska Inc. and the code name 'Mont Blanc' as \"commission payments\" and that the payment to M/s Moresc.o/Moineao/SA/Pitco, Geneva was deposited by Bofors in three f code name accounts, namely, \"Lotus\" in Suissee Bank Corporation, 2 Rue de la Confederation 1204, Geneva; \"Tulip\" in Manufacturers Han- nover Trust Company, 84 Rue du Rhone, 1204, Geneva and \"Mont Blane\" in Credit Suissee, 2 Place Belle Air, 1204, Geneva and that these payments to code name accounts are without mentioning or disclosing g the payers' names. Ultimately, reference was also made in paragraph 112 of the FIR to the statement of Mr Thulholm, Chairman of Noble Industries reading: h \"As the report of JPC discloses, Shri Thulholm, Chairman of Noble Industries had stated that so far as he was aware, payments had been made to Indians or to an Indian company in connection with the contract.

The core of the allegations in the FIR is that the accused, named a11d unnamed, entered into a criminal conspiracy, obtained illegal gratification in the form of money from BOFORS, a Swedish company a tilt..ro1J1gh the agent/firms/companies/persons as motive or reward for such publiie servants who by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise dis- hone:~,tly using their official position as public servants caused pecuniary advantage to themselves, BOFORS, the agents and others in awarding contiracts to BO FORS for the supply of guns to the Government of India b and in the transaction committed the offences of criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery and using of forged documents. It appears that the CBI has ,commenced its investigation during the course of which it has recorded statements of witnesses and took into its custody various docu- ~ menls and files relating to this Bofors deal. c .25. While it was so, the CBI moved an application before the Special Judge~, namely, Shri R.C. Jain requesting to issue a letter roga\\tory/request to Switzerland urgently for getting the necessary assistance so that the investigation can be conducted in Switzerland lest very important and relevant evidence would remain uncollected and the d cause of justice would be frustrated. :?6. Be it noted, the compelling reasons· which necessitated the CBI to file that application have already been given in brief in our earlier order dated August 27, 1991. 1 Therefore, we are not repeating those e facts in this final judgment. The Special Judge after hearing the then Addi1tional Solicitor General of India, Deputy Legal Advisor of CBI and Senior Public Prosecutor allowed that application by his order dated Fe:bmary 5, 1990, the relevant portion of which reads thus: \"In the result, the application of the CBI is allowed to the f t:!ctent that a request to conduct the necessary investigation and to collect necessary evidence which can be collected in Switzerland and to the extent directed in this order shall be made to the Competent Judicial Authorities of the Confederation of Switzerland through the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India subject to the filing of the requisite proper undertaking required by the Swiss law g a1nd assurance for reciprocity.\" 2:7. The Special Judge also directed certain documents to be sent along with this letter of rogatory. Further, the learned Judge has put up a note r,eading thus: h \"Needless to mention that no (sic any) observation made in this order shall tantamount to expression of opinion at any subsequent stage of enquiry or trial.\" 211.

The Special Judge, Shri V.S. Aggarwal dismissed that petition by his order dated August 18, 1990 observing thus: \"It goes without saying that letter rogatory had bee1:1 issued by S llui R.C. Jain, then Special Judge, Delhi on recording his satisfac- tion that it should be issued. The petitioner has appended along with the application the copy of the order passed by the Cantonal Court, Geneva. It is accompanied by its English translation. It clearly recites that application for judicial assistance should be sent back after completing the procedural formalities mentioned in the order.

Consequent upon the above findings, the Special Judge dis- missed the petition stating, \"This request of the learned counsel cannot be accepted\". Thereafter, the Special Judge issued (1) Note of Com- b pliance and (2) Amended letter rogatory on August 22, 1990. 32. On being aggrieved by the order of the Special Judge dated August 18, 1990, Shri Harinder Singh Chowdhary filed a criminal revi- sion before the High Court of Delhi under Sections 397/482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure raising multiple questions of law challenging the c le:gality and validity of not only the impugned order but also the very registration of the FIR and the investigation carried thereon by the CBI. The reliefs sought for in the criminal revision are as follows: \"(a) to quash the entire FIR No. RC l(A)/90/ACU-IV dated January 22, 1990 and criminal proceedings covered by the same. d (b) or remand the case to the Special Judge permitting the petitioner to argue his case before the lower court and also direct the court below to decide the petition on merits.

CHOWDHARY (Pandian, J.) 323 by the impending interveners seeking several prayers such as permitting them to implead themselves in the revision proceedings and affording a them adequate opportunities to make their submissions before the Court opposing the revision petition. As the prayers of the interveners were not acceded to, the Janata Dal etc. filed a Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 2320 of 1990 before this Court which passed an order on b C December 10, 1990, the relevant portion of which is as follows: \" ... Weare of the view that the learned Judge should dispose of these applications by a judicial order before the matter is reserved for judgment and in case the applications are not accepted, judg- ment should not be delivered for at least 2 days after such an order on these writ petitions (sic on the revision petition) is made to ,enable them to move this Court.\" :35. In compliance of the above direction of this Court, Mr Justice Chawla heard Mr Ram Jethamalani, senior counsel who appeared on behalf of Janata Dal and Mr Prashant Bhushan. It appears Mr d Jethamalani was constrained to make a request to Mr Justice Chawla to recw.e himself from the case, which request, of course, was rejected by the l,~amed Judge. Thereafter, a petition for recusation was filed which was also dismissed. Mr Justice Chawla after hearing the learned counsel for JJr H.S.

Prima facie, I am of the opinion that the following illegalities have been committed by the a trial court: (1) That the FIR filed by the CBI in this case on the face of it does not disclose any offence. It is in violation of the provisions of Section 154, inasmuch as no investigation can be carried out for an offence alleged to have been committed outside India, and the court b of the Special Judge should not have taken cognizance of the same. (2) That the CBI should have exhausted their remedies before the JPC before launching proceedings in the court of the Special Judge inasmuch as the same investigating agency cannot be allowed to override the findings of the JPC, and this aspect has not been c taken into consideration by the trial court. (3) The court of the Special Judge who issued letter rogatory had no jurisdiction to entertain such a request or to pass any order on it. ( 4) The so-called memo of understanding relied upon by the tri- d al court was contrary to the municipal law of the land and is violative of Articles 21 and 300-A of the Constitution of India. (5) That the CBI is not a legally constituted force which can be entrusted with the investigation; and (6) That the investigation on the face of it is biased and e influenced by outside agencies. So, I suo motu take cognizance while exercising my powers under Sections 397 and 401 read with Section 482 of the Code, and direct the office to register the case under the title, Court on its own motion v.

Consequently, I call upon the CBI and the State to show cause a:; to why the proceedings initiated on the filing of FIR No. RCI(A)/90/ACU-IV dated January 22, 1990, pending in the court of Shri V.S.

After carefully considering all aspects of the case and examining thie rival contentions of the parties we have recorded our conclusions in the earlier order as follows: (SCC pp. 768-69, paras 27-31) \"l. Mr H.S. Chowdhary has no locus standi (a) to file the peti- tion under Article 51-A as a public interest litigant praying that no lletter rogatory/request be issued at the request of the CBI and he be ]Permitted to join the inquiry before the Special Court which on Feb- iruary 5, 1990 directed issuance of letter rogatory/request to the 1:0mpetent Judicial Authorities of the Confederation of Switzer- land; (b) to invoke the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Sections 397 read with 401 of the Code of Criminal ]Procedure challenging the correctness, legality or propriety of the order dated August 18, 1990 of the Special Judge and (c) to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the first informa- 1 ion report dated January 22, 1990 and all other proceedings arising 1 herefrom on the plea of preventing the abuse of the process of the court. 2. In our considered opinion, the initiation of the present proceedings by Mr H.S. Chowdhary under Article 51-A of the Con- s.titution of India cannot come within the true meaning and scope of public interest litigation. 3. Consequent upon the above conclusions (1) and (2), the appellants namely, Janata Dai, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Indian Congress (Socialist) who are before this Court equally have no right of seeking their impleadment/intervention. For the same reasons, Dr P. Nalla Thampy Thera also has no right to file the 'IVrit Petition (Criminal) No. 114 of 1991 as a public interest litigant. 4. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the suo motu action of Mr Justice M.K Chawla in taking cognizance in e;:xercise of the powers under Sections 397 and 401 read with Sec- tion 482 of the Code based on the convoluted and strained reason- i r1g and directing the office of the High Court of Delhi to register a case under the title Court on its motion v.

Chawla calling upon the CBI and the State to show cause as to why the proceedings initiated on the strength of the first information report dated January 22, 1990 be 11 ot quashed, cannot be sustained. In the result, we agree with the first part of the order dated December 19, 1990 of Mr Justice M.K Chawla holding that Mr H.S. Chowdhary and other intervening parties have no locus standi.

Criminal Appeal No. 310 of 1991 filed by the Union of India against the order dated September 5, 1990 of the High c Court is dismissed in view of the fact that the said order does not survive for consideration on the passing of the final order dated December 19, 1990.

The sum and substance of the order of Mr Justice Chawla in this regard, is that Harinder Singh Chowdhary has no locus standi to file the revision petition and resultantly his revision petition was not maintainable and consequently all the applicants (interveners) have no e right to be impleaded and that the applications for implead- ment/1intervention were liable to be rejected. 41.

(2) The discretionary power of the Special Judge in issuing letter rogatory on February 5, 1990 even before the introduction of Section 166-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as \"the Code\") in exercise of his uninhibited inherent powers is supported by the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) creating a contractual arrangement between the two countries, namely, India and Switzerland which arrangement amounts to bilateral international treaty having a binding force between the two contracting parties and also in substantial compliance of Section 285 of the Code. (3) Criminal Courts are not forbidden in participating in the course of investigation in the matter of collection of evidence; and in fact the Courts are invested with statutory power to take active role and aid the investigation in gathering evidence as con- templated under Sections 91, 93, 94, 105 (as amended by the Amending Act 32 of 1988), 284, 285 etc. of the Code as well as under Sections 156(3), 157, 159, 167(2), 190, 202, 164, 306 etc. of the Code.

The learned counsel for the parties while advancing their argu- d ments on the above propositions posed several ancillary questions of law. ~fr :lJhagat made a special reference to the Geneva Convention Act of 1960, the Extra Convention Act of 1962, the International Monetary Fund and Banking Act of 1945, the Diplomatic Privileges Act of 1964 etc. in support of his contention that the present MOU cannot partake e of the force of law and that it cannot be invoked.

The High Court dismissed a the revision petition as being not maintainable on the sole ground of loc:us standi and did not go to other questions of law raised by Mr Chowdhary. Only for the first time before this Court, the parties are litigating on the above-stated propositions of law which except for one or two have neither been raised before the courts below nor agitated. Strict- b ly speaking, as the present appeals are preferred challenging only the juclgment of the High Court dated December 19, 1990, this Court is called upon to examine the tenability of the reasons given by the High Court as regards the locus standi of Mr H.S.

This Court while disposing of Criminal Appeal No. 31()6 of 1991 filed by Mr H.S. Chowdhary challenging the first part of th<: order of the High Court dismissing his revision petition on the ground that he has no locus standi, has confined its consideration only on that point. However, with regard to the various questions of law, we d expressed our view in our earlier order as follows: (SCC p. 768, para 26) e \"Even if there are million questions of law to be deeply gone into and examined iQ a criminal case of this nature registered against specified accused persons, it is for them and them alone to raise all such questions and challenge the proceedings initiated against them at the appropriate time before the proper forum and not for third parties under the garb of public interest litigants.\" 46. We have also given the reasons for not dealing with the specific propositions raised by the respective counsel in our earlier order observ- f ing thus: (SCC p. 767, para 25) \"Therefore, under these circumstances, one should not lose sight of the significant fact that in case this Court pronounces its final opinion or conclusions on the issues other than the general fasues raised by the appellants as public interest litigants, without g h hearing the really affected person/persons, such opinion or conclu- sions may, in future, in case the investigation culminates in filing a final report become detrimental and prejudicial to the indicated 21ccused persons who would be totally deprived of challenging such opinion or conclusions of this apex court, even if they happen to come in possession of some valuable material to canvass the correct- ness of such opinion or conclusions and consequently their vested legal right to defend their case in their own way would be completely nullified by the verdict now sought to be obtained by these public interest litigants.\" 47.

We hasten to add that we will not be justified to make dis- embodied pronouncements or any observation on seriously disputed questions of law and facts taking its cue from mere affidavits, that too not from the person aggrieved or affected and without the battle lines being properly drawn by the affected parties. 49. We shall now briefly deal with the scope and object of 'public interest litigation' (PIL), the horizon of which is widely extended and which at present constitutes a new chapter in justice delivery system acquiring a significant degree of importance in the modern legal jurisprudence practised by courts in many parts of the world, based on the: principle, \"Liberty and Justice for AH\". Public Interest Litigation - its origi.n and meaning SO. The question, \"what 'PIL' means and is\" has been deeply sur- veyed, explored and explained not only by various judicial pronounce- me,nts in many countries, but also by eminent Judges, jurists, activist lawyers, outstanding scholars, journalists and social scientists etc. with a vast erudition. Basically the meaning of the words 'Public Interest' is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edn. Vol. XII as \"the com- mon well being ... also public welfare\". 51. In Strouds Judicial Dictionary, Vol. IV ( 4th edn.) 'public interest' is defined thus: \"Public interest - 1. A matter of public or general interest does not mean that which is interesting as gratifying curiosity or a love of information or amusement; but that in which a class of the community have a pecuniary interest, or some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected.\" (Per Cambel C.J., in R. v. Bedfordshire3). 52. In Black's Law Dictionary (6th edn.), 'public interest' is defined as follows: \"Public Interest - Something in which the public, the corn- mu nity at large, has some pecuniary interest, or some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected. It does not mean anything so narrow as mere curiosity, or as the interests of the particular localities, which may be affected by the matters in ques- 3 24UQB84 a b C d e f g h i ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The expression 'litigation' means a legal action including all proceedings therein, initiated in a court of law with the purpose of enforcing a right or seeking a remedy. Therefore, lexically the apression 'PIL' means a legal action initiated in a court of law for the enforcement of piubl~c interest or general interest in which the public or a class of the b community have pecuniary interest or some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected. There is a host of decisions explaining the e:,q1ression 'PIL' in its wider connotation in the present day context in modem society, a few of which we will refer to in the appropriate part of C this juclgment. 54. It would be quite appropriate in the case on hand to analyse both the basic features and the evolution and profound transformation of the developing and growing PIL in modern society. Suffice it to say that the challenges facing this meliorable litigation are examined in the d light of their social, economic, political and ideological causes, and that the solutions to be adopted by the legal system to meet those challenges are explored, since there is still an ocean of unmet needs. These chal- lenges are: (1) The expanded role of courts in the modern 'social' State and the new demands for judicial responsibility; (2) the rise and growth 8 of vari,ed systems of judicial review and the legitimacy of such develop- ment; (3) the emergence of the notion of 'access to justice' as a judicial answer to egalitarian ideals and demands for effectiveness, and the devel- opment of PIL; and ( 4) the role of courts in prom:.ting the legal ;;ystem in tlbe arena of PIL. The relentless efforts taken by courts in meeting all f tho:,e challenges, in fact, strive for a optimality in which the interest of the least advantaged is given an overriding priority. During the last three decade:s, judicial activism has opened up new dimension for the judicial process and has given a new hope to the justice-starved millions. On the question of legitimacy of the PIL and the significant importance of its g variorn; aspects in the context of the present day felt needs, stimulated by the emergence of a variety of new social movements and societal exigen::ies, this Court has laid down a long line of decisions, outlining the evolutmn of PIL, its vital issues and problems relating to the focus, choice of relief methods, the means and the administrative strategy for h litigation and the demand for distributive justice for resolving the com- plicity of social problems and creating genuine initiatives so that this new activism may be more meaningful social justice.

The period of 1960s in United States of America was the a important period of social embroilment during which not only manifold 1:ha11ges to many institutions took place; but also significant reforms of whic:h public interest litigation was one were proposed and tried. The <:om:ept of PIL though had its origin in U.S.A, over the march of years it has passed through various changes and modifications in their common b law based systems. It is not necessary to examine all those modifications and changes in the structure of the public law of that country and the manner in which the legal services have been redistributed in American socic~ty except saying that the strict requirement of legal interest has been cliluled and attenuated in the country of its origin. Similarly, the common c law bmcd systems in other parts of the Commonwealth countries have also undergone various changes. Legal aid programmes in Australia and Canada have been restructured to serve divergent aspects of the public inte,rest. Some of the countries have gone to the extent of broadening its s1:ope even beyond litigation and including many varieties of negotiations d and even non-litigating approaches. Thus the definition of PIL emerged from historical context in which the commonality of the various forms of legal representation involving the basic and fundamental rights of a sig- nificant segment of the public demanding vindication of its rights has been recognised in various parts of the world. 8 ,56. The emergence of the concept of PIL, in the Indian legal system has been succinctly explained by P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) in one of his articles contributed under the caption \"Social Action Litiga- tion: The Indian Experience\" thus: f \"The judiciary has to play a vital and important role not only in preventing and remedying abuse and misuse of power but also in t!liminating exploitation and injustice. For this purpose it is neces- sary to make procedural innovations in order to meet the challenges posed by this new role of an active and committed judiciary. The g .mmmit judiciary in India, keenly alive to its social responsibility and :1ccountability to the people of the country, has liberated itself from the shackles of Western thought, made innovative use of the power of judicial review, forged new tools, devised new methods and fash- ioned new strategies for the purpose of bringing justice for socially iltnd economically disadvantaged groups.... h During the last four or five years however, judicial activism has opened up a new dimension for the judicial process and has given new hope to the justice-starved millions of India.\"• -4 Viele 'Rak of the Judiciary in Plural Societies' published in 1987. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Indian law has historically been strongly identified - both in theory and practice - with a tradition which has been concerned with a the rights and duties of individuals. Yet in recent years it has been recog- nise:d that this tradition is inadequate to cope with a wide range of problems arising out of inequality of means, opportunities and entitle- ments 1 n society. This conflict has generated increasing discussion of PIL, and also the development of a whole new corpus of law for effective and b purpos,~ful implementation of PIL and institutions explicitly concerned with thi~ manner and techniques by which the public interest is, and can be, :;afcguarded by the legal system. 58, The seed of the concept of PIL were initially sown in India by Krishna Iyer, J. in 1976 (without assigning the terminology) in Mumbai c Kamgar Sabha v. Abdulbhai Faizul/abhai 5• He while disposing an industrial dispute in regard to the payment of bonus, has observed: (SCC pp. 837--38, para 7) d e f g h i \"Our adjectival branch of jurisprudence, by and large, deals not wi '.h sophisticated litigants but the rural poor, the urban lay and the weaker societal segments for whom law will be an added terror if technical misdescriptions and deficiencies in drafting pleadings and set ting out the cause-title create a secret weapon to non-suit a party. Where foul play is absent, and fairness is not faulted, latitude is a grace of processual justice. Test litigations, representative actions, pro bono publico and like broadened forms of legal proceedings are in keeping with the current accent on justice to the common man and a necessary disincentive to those who wish to bypass the real issues on the merits by suspect reliance on peripheral, procedural shortcomings. Even Article 226, viewed in wider perspective, may be am1~nable to ventilation of collective or common grievances, as dis- tin1~uished from assertion of individual rights, although the tradi- tional view, backed by precedents has opted for the narrower alternative. Public interest is promoted by a spacious construction of locus standi in our socio-economic circumstances and conceptual lat, tudinarianism permits taking liberties with individualisation of the: right to invoke the higher courts where the remedy is shared by a c:onsiderable number, particularly when they are weaker. Less liti.;;ation, consistent with fair process, is the aim of adjectival law.\" 59. After the germination of the seeds of the concept of PIL in the soil of our judicial system, this rule of PIL was nourished, nurtured and developed by the apex court of this land by a series of outstanding deci- SJOnS. 60. In Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union v. Union of India' the terminology \"public interest litigation\" was used.

(as the learned Chi,ef Justice then was) and himself used the expression 'epistolary' juris- diction. However, this rule on gaining momentum day by day, burgeoned a more and more expanding its branches in the cosmos of PIL and took its root firmly in the Indian judiciary and fully blossomed with fragrant smell in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India 7. Locus Standi 61. Though it is imperative to lay down clear guidelines and proposi- tions; and outline the correct parameters for entertaining a Public Inter- est Litigation - particularly on the issue of locus standi yet no hard and fast rules have yet been formulated and no comprehensive guidelines have: been evolved. There is also one view that such adumberation is not pDMible and it would not be expedient to lay down any general rule which would govern all cases under all circumstances. 61. Be that as it may, it is needless to emphasise that the require- mien t of locm standi of a party to a litigation is mandatory; because the le:gal capacity of the party to any litigation whether in private or public action in relation to any specific remedy sought for has to be primarily m;certained at the threshold. b C d 63. The traditional syntax of law in regard to locus standi for a specific judicial redress, sought by an individual person or determinate class or identifiable group of persons, is available only to that person or e class or group of persons who has or have suffered a legal injury by reasons of violation of his or their legal right or a right legally protected, the invasion of which gives rise to actionability within the categories of law. In a private action, the litigation is bipolar; two opposed parties are lo:;ked in a confrontational controversy which pertains to the determina- f tion of the legal consequences of past events unlike in public action. The character of such litigation is essentially that of vindicating private rights, proce:edings being brought by the persons in whom the right personally inher,e or their legally constituted representatives who are thus obviously most competent to commence the litigation. g ti4. In contrast, the strict rule of locus standi applicable to private litigation is relaxed and a broad rule is evolved which gives the right of lcx:us standi to any member of the public acting bona fide and having suf- ficient interest in instituting an action for redressal of public wrong or h publi<: injury, but who is not a mere busybody or a meddlesome inter- loper; since the dominant object of PIL is to ensure observance of the prow.ions of the Constitution or the law which can be best achieved to advance the cause of community or disadvantaged groups and individuals i 7 19tH Supp sec 87: AIR 1982 SC 149 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(i,5. It will be befitting to recall the observation of this Court in Peopl,f!'s Uni.on for Democratic Rights v. Uni.on of lndia 8 which reads thus: (SCC pp. 248-49, para 9) \"But the traditional rule of standing which confines access to the judicial process only to those to whom legal injury is caused or le.gal wrong is done has now been jettisoned by this Court and the narrow confines within which the rule of standing was imprisoned for long years as a result of inheritance of the Anglo-Saxon system of jurisprudence have been broken and a new dimension has been given to the doctrine of locus standi which has revolutionised the whole concept of access to justice in a way not known before to the western system of jurisprudence .... [I]t is therefore necessary to evolve a new strategy by relaxing this traditional rule of standing in order that justice may become easily available to the lowly and the lost.\" 66. R.S. Pathak, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) while agreeing with the directions proposed by Bhagwati, J. ( as the learned Chief .Justice then was) in Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Uni.on of India' expressed his view stating, \"In public interest litigation, the role held by ColLlrt liS more assertive than in traditional actions\". (SCC p. 229, para 55) 6~1. M.N. Venkatachaliah, J. speaking for the Bench in Sheela Barse v. Union of Jndia 10 has brought out the distinction between private litiga- tion and public interest litigation in the following words: (SCC pp. 223- 34, para 11) \"In a public interest litigation, unlike traditional dispute resolu- tion mechanism, there is no determination or adjudication of individual rights. While in the ordinary conventional adjudications the party structure is merely bi-polar and the controversy pertains to the determination of the legal consequences of past events and the remedy is essentially linked to and limited by the logic of the array of th,! parties, in a public interest action the proceedings cut across and transcend these traditional forms and inhibitions.

The dispute is not comparable to one between private parties with the result there is no recognition of the status of a dominus litis a !'or any individual or group of individuals to determine the course or destination of the proceedings, except to the extent recognised and permitted by the court. The \"rights' of those who bring the action on lt,ehalf of the others must necessarily be subordinate to the · interests' of those for whose benefit the action is brought. The grievance in a public interest action, generally speaking, is about the b c::ontent and conduct of government action in relation to the con- stitutional or statutory rights of segments of society and in certain circumstances the conduct of government policies. Necessarily, both the party structure and the matters in controversy are sprawling and amorphous, to be defined and adjusted or readjusted as the case c may be, ad hoe, according as the exigencies of the emerging situa- tions. The proceedings do not partake of predetermined private law liltigation models but are exogenously determined by variations of t be theme.\" t,8. Though we have, in our country, recognised a departure from d the sltrict rule of locus standi as applicable to a person in private action and broadened and liberalised the·rule of standing and thereby permitted a member of the public, having no personal gain or oblique motive to approach the court for enforcement of the constitutional or legal rights of socially or economically disadvantaged persons who on account of e th1:!ir poverty or total ignorance of their fundamental righ~s are unable to enter the portals of the courts for judicial redress, yet no precise and inilexible working definition has been evolved in respect of locus standi of an individual seeking judicial remedy and various activities in the field of PIJL. Probably, some reservation and diversity of approach to the f philosophy of PIL among some of the Judges of this Court as reflected from !the various decisions of this Court, is one of the reasons for this Court finding it difficult to evolve a consistent jurisprudence in the field of PIL. True, in defining the rule of locus standi no 'rigid litmus test' can be applied since the broad contours of PIL are still developing apace g Se(!mingly with divergent views on several aspects of the concept of this newly developed law and discovered jurisdiction leading to a rapid trans- forma1tion of judicial activism with a far-reaching change both in the naturt;: and form of the judicial process. h 6!1>. In this context, it would be quite relevant to recite the observa- tions made by Bhagwati, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) in S.P. Gupta v.

The court has to innovate new methods an.d devise new strategies for the purpose of providing access to justice to large masses of people who are denied their basic human rights and to whom freedom and liberty have no meaning. The only way in which this can be done is by entertaining writ petitions and even let- te:rs from public-spirited individuals seeking judicial redress for the bc:nefit of persons who have suffered a legal wrong or a legal injury or whose constitutional or legal right has been violated but who by re:ason of their poverty or socially or economically disadvantaged position are unable to approach the court for relief.\" (emphasis supplied) 70. As briefly pointed out in S.P. Gupta case1 there are certain c exceptions carved out of the strict rule of standing, to be made applicable to PIL cases. By way of illustration, it may be stated that under Order 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure, any person acting as the next friend of a minor may bring an action in his name for judicial redress. So also any other person other than the person under detention may file an applica- d tion for issue of a writ of habeas corpus challenging the legality of the deti:!ntion of the detenu. Similarly, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council approved the ~xception to the strict rule of standing in Durayap- pah v. Femando 11• In United States of America also, though the excep- tion has been recognised and the strict rule of standing has been e liberal [sed in the interest of justice, it has been attenuated later on in some of the cases vide (1) Data Processing Service v.

In these days when government departments and public authorities have such great powers and influence, this is a most important safeguard for the ordinary citizens of this country; so that they can see that those great powers and influence are exercised in accordance with law. I would not restrict the circumstances in which an individual may be held to have a suf- fifient interest .... I have said so much because I regard it as a matter of high con- stitutional principle that if there is good ground for supposing that a government department or a public authority is transgressing the law, or is about to transgress it, in a way which offends or injures thousands of Her Majesty's subjects, then in the last resort any one of those offended or injured can draw it to the attention of the courts of law and seek to have the law enforced. But this, I would emphasise, is only in the last resort when there is no other remedy reasonably available to secure that the law is obeyed.\" 7:~. In R v. Greater London Council, ex parte Blackbum 18, one Albert Raymond Blackburn and Tessa Marion Blackbum applied for an order of prohibition to issue against the Greater London Council (the 'GLC') to prevent them from exercising their censorship powers over the public exhibi1:ion of cinematograph films in accordance with a test of obscenity which was bad in law. The Divisional Court of Queen's Bench Division refused the order and dismissed the application. Challenging that order Raymond Blackbum came before the Court of Appeal. The appeal was opposed on the ground of locus standi contending that Blackbum had no sufficient interest to bring those proceedings against the GLC. Lord Denning, MR rejected that contention relating to locus standi conclud- ing thus: \"In my opinion, therefore, Mr Blackbum has made out his case. He has shown that the GLC have been exercising their censorship powers in a manner which is unlawful; because they have been applying a test which is bad in law. If they continue with their present wrong test and in consequence give their consent to films which are grossly indecent, they may be said to be aiding and abet- ting a criminal offence. In these circumstances, this court can and should issue an order of prohibition to stop them.\" 74 . Subsequently in Gouriet v.

Bhagwati, J. in S.P. Gupta 's case1 (popularly known as Judges' Appointment and Trans[ er case) which was heard by a Bench of seven learned Judges, has clearly defined 'what PIL means and is' and expressed his views in meticulous detail in the following terms: (SCC pp. 210-11, para 17) \"It may therefore now be taken as well established that where a legal wrong or a legal injury is caused to a person or to a determinate class of persons by reason of violation of any constitu- t1 onal or legal right or any burden is imposed in contravention of any constitutional or legal provision or without authority of law or any such legal wrong or legal injury or illegal burden is threatened and such person or determinate class of persons is by reason of poverty, helplessness, or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position, unable to approach the court for relief, any member of the public can maintain an application for an appropriate direction, order or writ in the High Court under Article 226 and in case of breach of any fundamental right of such person or determinate class of persons, in this Court under Article 32 seeking judicial redress for tlhe legal wrong or injury caused to such person or determinate class of persons .... This Court will readily respond even to a letter addressed by such individual acting pro bono publico. It is true that there are rules made by this Court prescribing the procedure for moving this Court for relief under Article 32 and they require various formalities to be gone through by a person seeking to approach this Court. But it must not be forgotten that procedure is but a handmaiden of justice and the cause of justice can never be allowed to be thwarted by any procedural technicalities. The court would therefore unhesitatingly and without the slightest qualms of conscience cast aside the technical rules of procedure in the exercise of its dispensing power and treat the letter of public-minded individual as a writ petition and act upon it .... But we must hasten to make it clear that the individual who moves the court for judicial redress in cases of this kind must be acting bona fide with a view to vindicating the cause of justice and if he is acting for personal gain or private profit or out of political motivation or other oblique con- sideration, the court should not allow itself to be activised at the instance of such person and must reject his application at the threshold, whether it be in the form of a letter addressed to the court or even in the form of a regular writ petition filed in court.

After having elaborately explained the concept of PIL, the b leamc~ Judge held that: (SCC·p. 218, para 23) \" ... any member of the public having sufficient interest can maintain an action for judicial redress for public injury arising from breach of public duty or from violation of some provision of the Constitution or the law and seek enforcement of such public duty c and observance of such constitutional or legal provision. This is absolutely essential for maintaining the rule of law, furthering the cause of justice and accelerating the pace of realisation of the con- stitutional objectives.\" 93. However, the learned Judge has sounded a note of caution to d the courts to be observed while entertaining a public interest litigation as foUows: (SCC p. 219, para 24) \"But we must be careful to see that the member of the public, who approaches the court in cases of this kind, is acting bona fide allld not for personal gain or private profit or political motivation or e other oblique consideration. The court must not allow its process to bte abused by politicians and others to delay legitimate administra- tive action or to gain a political objective.\" 94. The other learned Judges - namely, Gupta, Tulzapurkar, Fazal Ali, Desai and Pathak, JJ. - who were parties to the above judgment f have all agreed in general with the views expressed by Bhagwati, J. on the que::stion of locus standi. However, Desai, J. added a note saying \"that the contention about locus standi is now of academic interest and I do not propose to deal with it. However, I am in full agreement with learned Bhagwati, J.\" g 9S. However, Venkataramiah, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) in his separate judgment with regard to the question of locus standi of lawyers in filing petitions in respect of matters concerning judges, courts and administration of justice has registered his opinion thus: (SCC p. 773, paras 989 and 990) h \"It has, however, to be made clear that it cannot be said that lawyers only because they have a right to practise in a court have 'locus standi' to file petitions in respect of every matter concerning judges, courts and administration of justice.

By way of illustration, lawyers cannot question the establishment of a new court on the ground that their professional prospects would be affected thereby. Even in these cases on the question of non- appointment of Mr S.N. Kumar and on the question of transfer of Mr KB.N. Singh, the lawyer-petitioners may have no voice. But for the active participation of these two persons, the petitions regarding rcliefs concerning them individually would have probably become liable to be dismissed on the ground that the lawyers have no 'locus standi' to make these prayers. But, since as already stated, Mr S.N. Kumar and Mr K.B.N. Singh have requested the Court to consider and if thought fit to grant relief in their favour and the learned Attorney-General has fairly stated that he would not raise the objection that the petitioners have no locus standi in view of the importance of the questions debated in these cases, we hold that the. petitions cannot be rejected merely on the ground that the petitioners who are lawyers have no locus standi to file these petitions. Before leaving this topic, it has to be observed that the question of locus standi in th1e field of administrative law is still in a fluid state and it is not pos- sible to lay down in any one case the principles which can govern all situations.\" 9(i. On an assiduous analysis and scrupulous study of the major land- mark decision of Gupta case1 which serves as a charter of PIL, we unreseavedly hold that the said decision describes the broad definition of the expression 'PIL', explores the conceptual problems, outlines the evolution of legal strategies, discusses the institutionalisation of the PIL movement and concludes with innovative methods and devices for increasing citizens' participation to promote reforms of the legal system in ord1;~r to ensure real access to t_he justice delivery system, and to encourage the continuation and expansion of public interest representa- tion. Above all, it has opened wide the doors of the Court to millions of poor, ignorant and socially or economically disadvantaged to articulate their grievances and seek justice which otheiwise would have been denied to them. 97, In short, the decision in Gupta case7 is a golden master key which has provided access to the Courts for the poor and downtrodden.

He has also left the following note~ of caution: (SCC p. 219, para 24) b \"But we must .be careful to see that the member of the public, who approaches the court in cases of this kind, is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private profit or political motivation or other oblique consideration.

A Parent of a Student of Medical College 32 it has been said that public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be usecll with great care and circumspection. 101. Khalid, J. in his separate supplementing judgment in Sachidanand Pandey v. State of W.B. 33 said: \"Today public spirited litigants rush to courts to file cases in profusion under this attractive name. They must inspire confidence in courts and among the public. They must be above suspicion. (SCC p. 331, para 46) * * * Public interest litigation has now come to stay. But one is led to think that it poses a threat to courts and public alike. Such cases are now filed without any rhyme or reason. It is, therefore, necessary to lay down clear guidelines and to outline the correct parameters for entertainment of such petitions. If courts do not restrict the free flow of such cases in the name of public interest litigations, the tradi- tional litigation will suffer and the courts of law, instead of dispens- ing justice, will have to take upon themselves administrative and ,executive functions.

Roshan Kumar-34 expressed his view that the application of the busybody should be rejected at the threshold in the following terms: (SCC p. 683, para 37) \"It will be seen that in the context of locus standi to apply for a writ of certiorari, an applicant may ordinarily fall in any of these cat- egories: (i) 'person aggrieved'; (ii) 'stranger'; (iii) busybody or meddlesome interloper. Persons in the last category are easily dis- tinguishable from those coming under the first two categories. Such persons interfere in things which do not concern them. They masquerade as crusaders for justice. They pretend to act in the name of pro bono publico, though they have no interest of the public or even of their own to protect. They indulge in the pastime of med- dling with the judicial process either by force of habit or from improper motives. Often, they are actuated by a desire to win notoriety or cheap popularity; while the ulterior intent of some applicants in this category, may be no more than spoking the wheels of administration. The High Court should do well to reject the applications of such busybodies at the threshold.\" 105. Krishna Iyer, J. in Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union v. Union of lndia 6 in stronger terms stated: (SCC p. 589, para 48) \"If a citizen is no more than a wayfarer or officious intervener without any interest or concern beyond what belongs to any one of the 660 million people of this country, the door of the court will not be ajar for him.\" 106.

K..N. Singh, J. speaking for the Bench in Subhash Kumar v.

If such petitions under Article 32, are entertained it would amount to abuse of process of the court, preventing speedy remedy to other genuine petitioners from this Court. Personal interest cannot be enforced through the process of this Court under Article 32 of the d Constitution in the garb of a public interest litigation. Public interest liti',gation contemplates legal proceeding for vindication or enforce- ment of fundamental rights of a group of persons or community which are not able to enforce their fundamental rights on account of their incapacity, poverty or ignorance of law. A person invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 must approach this Court e for the vindication of the fundamental rights of affected persons and nol. for the purpose of vindication of his personal grudge or enmity. It is the duty of this Court to discourage such petitions and to ensure that the course of justice is not obstructed or polluted by umcrupulous litigants by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of f this Court for personal matters under the garb of the public interest Ii ti,gation.\" 10!>. It is thus clear that only a person acting bona fide and having sufficient interest in the proceeding of PIL will alone have a locus standi and can approach the court to wipe out the tears of the poor and needy, g suffering from violation of their fundamental rights, but not a person for personal gain or private profit or political motive or any oblique consid- eration.

The sum and substance of the inculpation as gathered from the averme:mts made in the petition and the submissions made by Mr Bhagat on behalf of H.S. Chowdhary, in short, are that those who were at the helm of affairs in the then Government during January 1990 in their d attempt to lock horns with those who were in power of the then outgoing Government with mala tide intention of vindicating their electoral rivalry have been instrumental in registration of the FIR containing the unvera- cious a1rid vile charges by using every possible trick and ruse at their com- e mand a1nd disposal and making vociferous verbal attack with their lung power 1to settle their personal scores with their political opponents. The further attack against the author of the FIR and the investigating agency is that 1 he CBI under \"pressure of its political masters in conspiracy with them have been giving recklessly the names of various leaders of this f country to tarnish their image without any basis\"; and the onset of the investigation is biased, unfair and unethical and the procedure adopted is in utter violation of the provisions of the Constitution and the procedural law. llS.

He continues to acrimoniously urge that Mr Chowdhary is acting as a proxy under the mask of public interest litigant for the benefit of all the real accused, in the discovery of whose identity the whole nation is interested and that Mr Chowdhary on being inspired by some other extraneous considera- tion is attempting to keep all the named and unnamed accused behind a smok~;creen so that the identity of those recipients of the kickbacks and bribes should not be discovered and go unpunished and the bribe money depositted in Swiss Banks should not be frozen. He also says the very pur- pose of filing this petition by Mr Chowdhary for quashing the proceed- ings is only to stultify and frustrate the proceedings against the accused. He further states that when the scandal of Bofors' affairs involving cland~.tine payoffs at the highest level which has come to light and sur- faced by the Swedish Radio Broadcast, has assumed mammoth propor- tion, M:r Chowdhary pretentiously claiming to be a crusader for justice in the name of pro bona publico has filed this benami litigation at the instance of the holders of foreign bank accounts and is attempting to thwart and stall the proceedings by masquerading the accused persons as paragons of virtue. 117. Mr Anand Dev Giri, the learned Solicitor General stating that public interest litigation is not in the nature of adversarial litigation and it is intended to promote and vindicate public interest which demands that violation of constitutional or legal rights of large number of people who are poor, ignorant or in a socially or economically disadvantaged posi- tion, should not go unnoticed and unredressed. According to him, the very litigation itself is not within the definition of public interest litigation and more so H.S. Chowdhary absolutely has no locus standi to approach the Court by filing the petition under Sections 397 and 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by way of a revision of the order of the Special Judge and also quashing the criminal case filed against some known and unknown persons, involved in a series of criminal offences of conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and bribery.

Mr K.G. Bhagat, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of tvfr Chowdhary after stating that the pro bono parties must have real, b tangible and perceptible interest, urged that in the present case, Mr Chowdhary has espoused only real public interest and, therefore, his right of locus standi cannot be questioned. He asserts that the very registration of the case smacks of political vendetta. 119. After deeply and carefully considering the submissions of all the C partic~s, we see much force in the submissions made by the learned Solicitor General, Mr AD. Giri and Mr Jethamalani, senior counsel. A perm.al of the petitions filed by H.S. Chowdhary before the Special Judg,i! and the High Court clearly unfolds that Mr Chowdhary appears to d be vc:ry much concerned with the personal and private interest of the accm;ed in the criminal case and there is absolutely no involvement of publil; interest. Can it be said that this litigation is in the nature of PIL to vindkate and effectuate the public interest? The emphatic answer would be: '.l\\'ot even a single ray of the characteristic of public interest litigation e is visibly seen'. 1120. Indeed, we are surprised to note that in the petition filed befone the High Court, Mr Chowdhary has stated that it is his duty to see that · individuals' get justice from the Indian Courts. From whichever angle we survey and audit the contentions in both the petitions before f th,e courts below and the petition filed before this Court, there can be no es1;ape except to come to the conclusion that Mr Chowdhary has no locus standi at all to file these petitions, as found by the courts below. 121. In this connection, we would like to add a few words about the dismissaJ of the applications of the interveners. g 122. The High Court rejected the applications of the interveners as having no right to be impleaded as a consequence of the dismissal of the petition of H.S. Chowdhary on the ground that he has no locus standi. We too in our earlier order having held that H.S. Chowdhary has no h locus standi to file the petition or to invoke the revisional or ex1raordinary inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under Sections 397 and 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure respectively and that the peitition under Article 51-A of the Constitution cannot come within the true meaning and scope of public interest litigation, dismissed the i apjp)ications of the interveners holding thus: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It is significant to note that Mr Prashant Bhushan in his written submissions has stated, \"the Janata Dai never claimed any Jocus to inter- vene in the matter; and that in fact its stand is that Mr Chowdhary has no c locus to interfere in the investigation and that the Janata Dai intervened in the matter only after the High Court began to serious]y entertain the petition of Mr Chowdhary without even deciding the question of his locus and that the Janata Dal's intervention was only to prevent sabotage of the 1:nvestigation.\" d Revisional and Inherent Powers of the High Court 125.

Chawla has taken an extreme view that \"the Court can take judicial notice of any illegality bein,i: committed by any Court, with a view to prevent the injury being a caus,;:d to the known or unknown aggrieved party\", even when the inve~.tigation is at its threshold. The very sentence which we have quoted above is indicative of the fact that the learned Judge in order to protect any possible injury that might be caused either during the investigation or on the culmination of the criminal proceedings to the known or unknown b a~1{rieved party has determined to take suo motu cognizance and proceed w1ith the matter, by virtually stepping into the shoes of the accused parti1;:S both present and prospective. :127. Now let us briefly cogitate over the legal issue relating to the revisional and inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to call for the c records and examine the records of any proceeding before any inferior crimirial court within its jurisdiction for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order, recorded or passed and to quash criminal proceeding, deliberate on the legali1y and correctness of the later part of the order of Justice M.K. d Chawla in and by which he has assumed the jurisdiction to initiate suo motu proceedings, particularly for quashing the first information report and all other connected and allied proceedings arising during the course of the: investigation. 1.28. Sections 397, 401 and 482 of the new Code are analogous to Sections 435, 439 and 561-A of the old Code of 1898 except for certain substi1utions, omissions and modifications. Under Section 397, the High Court possesses the general power of superintendence over the actions e of courts subordinate to it which discretionary power when administered f on administration side, is known as the power of superintendence and on the judicial side as the power of revision. ln exercise of the discretionary powers conferred on the High Court under the provisions of this section, the: High Court can, at any stage, on its own motion, if it so desires and certainly when illegalities and irregularities resulting in injustice are g brought to its notice, call for the records and examine them. The words in Secllion 435 are, however, very general and they empower the High Court to call for the record of a case not only when it intends to satisfy itself about the correctness of any finding, sentence or order but also as to 1he regularity of any proceeding of any subordinate court. h 129.

The object of the revisional jurisdiction under Section 401 is to confor power upon superior criminal courts - a kind of paternal or supervisory jurisdiction - in order to correct miscarriage of justice aris- ing from misconception of law, irregularity of procedure, neglect of proper precaution or apparent harshness of treatment which has resulted, on the one hand, or on the other hand in some underserved harw,hip to individuals. The controlling power of the High Court is dis- cretionary and it must be exercised in the interest of justice with regard to all facts and circumstances of each particular case, anxious attention bein~~ given to the said facts and circumstances which vary greatly from case to c:ase. 131. Section 482 which corresponds to Section 561-A of the old Code and to Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code proceeds on the same principle and deals with the inherent powers of the High Court. The rule of inherent powers has its source in the maxim \"Quadolex ali- qui.d alicui concedit, concedere vi.detur i.d sine quo ipsa, ess uon potest\" which means that when the law gives anything to anyone, it gives also all those th1ings without which the thing itself could not exist. 132. The criminal courts are clothed with inherent power to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice. Such power though unrestricted and undefined should not be capriciously or arbitrarily exercised, but should be exercised in appropriate cases, ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice for the administration of which alone the courts exist. The powers possessed by the High Court under &:ction 482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the power requires great caution in its exercise. Courts must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound prin- ciples. 133. The Judicial Committee in Emperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad◄ 1 and (2) Lala Jairam Das v. Empero~2 has taken the view that Sec- tion 561--A of the old Code gave no new powers but only provided that those with the Court already inherently possessed should be preserved. This view holds the field till date. 134. This Court in Dr Raghubir Sharan v. State of Bihar0 had an occasion to examine the extent of inherent power of the High Court and its jurisdiction when to be exercised.

[E]very High Court as the highest court exercising criminal a jurisdiction in a State has inherent power to make any order for the purpose of securing the ends of justice .... Being an extraordinary power it will, however, not be pressed in aid except for remedying a flagrant abuse by a subordinate court of its powers .... \" 135. See Talab Haji Hussain v. Madhukar Purshottam Mondkar44 b and .Pampapathy v. State of Mysore 45• 136. Thus, the inherent power under this section can be exercised by the High Court ( 1) to give effect to any order passed under the Code; or (2) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court; or (3) otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In relation to exercise of inherent powers of c the .High Court, it has been observed in Madhu Limaye v. State of lviaharashtra 46 that the power is not to be resorted to if there is a specific provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of the aggrieved party and that it should be exercised very sparingly to prevent abuse of d proc1::ss of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice and that it should not be exercised as against the express bar of law engrafted in any other provision.of the Code. Vide (1) Talab Haji Hussain v. Madhukar Pztrhwttam«; (2) Khushi Ram v. Hashim 47; and (3) State of Orissa v. Ram Chander Agarwala 48• e 137. This inherent power conferred by Section 482 of the Code should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution. The High Olurt being the highest court of a State should normally refrain from giving a premature decision in a case wherein the entire facts are extremely incomplete and hazy, more so when the evidence has not been t collected and produced before the Court and the issues involved whether fa1;tual or legal are of great magnitude and cannot be seen in their true perspective without sufficient material. Of course, no hard and fast rule cat1 be laid down in regard to the cases in which the High Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the proceedings at any g stage. This Court in State of Haryana v. Ch. Bhajan La/49 to which both of us were parties have dealt with this question at length and enunciated the law listing out the circumstances under which the High Court can exercise its jurisdiction in quashing proceedings.

CHOWDHARY (Pandian, J.) 357 think it necessary in the present case to extensively deal with the import and inte:ndment of the powers under Sections 397, 401 and 482 of the Code:. 138. The question that arises for our consideration is whether Mr Justice :M.K Chawla in exercise of his inherent power is justified in directing the office of the High Court to register a case so that he could exercise his discretionary revisional and inherent powers. The text and tenor of the impugned order spells out that the initiation of the suo motu proceed1ings is to quash the FIR and the proceedings connected there- with as clearly borne out from the learned Judge's statement reading \"that the FIR filed by the CBI in this case on the face of it does not dis- close any offence\". 139. The three decisions cited and relied upon by Mr Justice M.K Chawla in his order cannot be of any assistance for initiating a suo motu proceeding when the matter is under serious investigation. 140. In Ratan Singh case38 the High Court of Madhya Pradesh find- ing ce:rtain illegalities in the prosecution relating to setting aside the con- viction of two accused persons in an appeal preferred by them, extended the benefit to a non-appealing accused by exercising its suo motu revisional jurisdiction. 141. In Mohammed case39, the observation of the Kerala High Court that '''if .1 clear illegality or injustice comes to the notice of the High Court by whatsoever means it might be, the suo motu jurisdiction of the High Court is available to correct such mistake\". This observation was made having regard to the facts of that case wherein the appellant instead of filing an appeal, filed a revision which was dismissed. There- upon, realising the mistake the appellant filed an appeal before the appellate court with an application for condonation of delay which was dismissed as barred by limitation. Then the appellant filed a revision before the High Court which allowed the petition holding that it would advance lhe ends of justice. It was only in those circumstances the obser- vation about the suo motu exercise of the power was made. 11i2. In the third case relied on by Justice M.K Chawla, namely, Range Forest Officer case\"\" a vehicle belonging to the respondent was confiscated. The respondent unsuccessfully preferred an appeal against the order of confiscation before the Sessions Judge. Thereafter, the respondent filed a revision before the High Court under Section 397 of the new Code which was allowed and the confiscation was set aside. The appellant in this case filed an application under Article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution for a certificate of fitness for appeal to the Supreme Court.

Therefore, the High Court observed that even if the respondent had no right to file the revision nevertheless, the High Court could exercise its power of revision suo motu. a 143. On carefully going through all the three decisions, we unhi;:sitatingly hold that none of the decisions would be of any help to the facts of the present case. 144. The inherent power of a High Court to stay proceedings has been repeatedly debated in many English Courts and a majority of the b judgments has stressed that the power of staying proceedings should be reserved only for exceptional cases. We are not inclined to refer to all thos,e English decisions except a few. 145. In Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions50 Lord Ried at c page: 1296 expressed his view \"there must always be a residual discretion to prevent anything which savours of abuse of process\" with which view aU the members of the House of Lords agreed but differed as to whether this c:ntitled a Court to stay a lawful prosecution. 146. The inherent power of a Court to stay proceedings was again d the subject of debate in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humph,ys 51• 147. Most of the decisions of the English cases laid down the dictum that only in cases where there is substantial amount of delay or potential abuse:! of process or vexatious prosecution or the proceedings are tainted with malice etc. alone the Court can step in by exercise of the inherent e powe:r. 148. The Privy Council in Emperor v . .Khwaja Nazir Ahmad41 exam- ined the question of the inherent power of the High Court in interfering with the statutory investigation of the police and laid down the following dictum: \"Just as it is essential that every one accused of a crime should have free access to a Court of justice so that he may be duly acquitted if found not guilty of the offence with which he is charged, so it is of the utmost importance that the judiciary should not inter- fere with the police in matters which are within their province and into which the law imposes upon them the duty of enquiry. In India as has been shown there is a statutory right on the part of the police to investigate the circumstances of an alleged cognizable crime without requiring any authority from the judicial authorities, and it would, as their Lordships think, be an unfortunate result if it should be held possible to interfere with those statutory rights by an exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.

In such a case as the present, however, the Court's functions begin when a charge is preferred before it and not until then. It has sometimes been thought that Section 561-A has given increased powers to the Court which it did not possess before that section was enacted. But this is not so. The section gives no new powers, it only provides that those which the Court already inherently possess shall be:: preserved and is inserted, as their Lordships think, lest it should be:: considered that the only powers possessed by the Court are those expressly conferred by the Criminal Procedure Code, and that no inherent power had survived the passing of that Act. No doubt, if no cognizable offence is disclosed, and still more if no offence of any kind is disclosed, the police would have no authority to undertake an investigation.\" 14-9. Lord Denning in R. v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner52 has observ1ed thus: \"Although the chief officers of police are answerable to the law, there are many fields in which they have a discretion with which the law will not interfere:. For instance, it is for the Commissioner of Police or the chief constable, as the case may be, to decide in any particular case whether enquiries should be pursued, or whether an arrest should be made or a prosecution brought. It must be for him to decide on the disposition of his force and the concentration of his re:s.ources on any particular crime or area. No court can or should give him direction on such a matter.\" 150. This Court in Jehan Singh v. Delhi Administration53 held that when 1 he first information report discloses the commission of a cog- nizable offence, the statutory power of the Police to investigate the cog- nizable offence cannot be interfered with in exercise of the inherent power of the Court. 151. Chandrachud, J. ( as he then was) in Ku.ntkshetra University v. State of Ha,yana 31 pointed out thus: (AIR Headnote) \"Inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim or caprice.

Indeed, a noticeable feature of the scheme under Chapter XIV of the Code is that a Magistrate is kept in the picture a1t all stages of the police investigation but he is not authorised to interfere with the actual investigation or to direct the police how that investigation is to be conducted. But if a police officer trans- gresses the circumscribed limits and improperly and illegally g eJ,ercises his investigatory powers in breach of any statutory provi- sion causing serious prejudice to the personal liberty and also property of a citizen, then the court on being approached by the person aggrieved for the redress of any grievance, has to consider the nature and extent of the breach and pass appropriate orders as h may be called for without leaving the citizens to the mercy of police e<:helons since human dignity is a dear value of our Constitution.\" s• (19SO) 1 sec 554: 1980 sec (C:ri) 2n ; 55 1989 Supp 2 sec 385: AIR 1985 sc 1668 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Sha.nna57• 156. Sawant, J. in his s1Ubmission note in Kekoo J. Afaneckji v. Union of IndiaS3 has expressed his opinion thus: \"This is admittedly a stage where the prosecuting agency is still investigating the offences and collecting evidence against the accused. The petitioner, who is the accused, has therefore, no locus standi at this stage to question the manner in which the evidence should be collected. The law of this country does not give any right to the accused to control, or interfere with, the coUection of evi- dence.\" 157. The seven Judges Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court c went into the matter very exhaustively in Ram Lal Yadav v. State of U.P. 59 and held that \"the power of the police to investigate into a report which discloses the commission of a cognizable offence is unfettered and can- not be interfered with by the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 Criminal Procedure Code\". This decision has d overruled two earlier decisions of that Court in Prashant Gaur v. State of U.P.60 andPuttan Singh v. State ofU.P.'1 158. After the proposition of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to exercise of the extraordinary power under Article e 226 of the Constitution or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code in Bhajan Lal case49, we have given certain category of cases by way of illustrations wherein the power of quashing could be exercised either for preventing abuse of process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice stating that it may not be possible to lay down any precise, f clearly defined and sufficient channelised infrangible guidelines and rigid formula to give an exhaustive list of various kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised. We do not like to prolong the discussion on this point any more. However, it has become necessary at least to deal with the first alleged illegality. We are constrained to do so because of g the assertion of the High Court; that being \"that the first information report on the face of it does not disclose any offence\". h i 159. According to Mr Ram Jethamalani, the conclusion, arrived at by Mr Justice M.K. Chawla is absolutely unjustified and perverse since the first information report in paragraphs 8, 16, 67, 68, 73 clearly alleges S6 (1977) 4 sec 137: 1977 sec (Cri) 585 57 1992Supp (1) SCC222: 1992SCC(Cri) 192: (1991) 1 Scale S39 SS 1980 Cri I..J 258 (Born) 59 1989 Cri I..J 1013: 1989 UP Cri R 79: 1989 API..J (Cri) 107 (All) 60 1988 A we 828 (AU) 61 1987 All I..J 599: 1987 AWC40~ (All) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

We have carefully and scrupulously gone through the a first information report and we are unable to share this view of Mr Justice Chawla, quite apart from the other grounds on which the accused may like to attack the first information report. None of the named accused came before Mr Justice Chawla raising this question of lack of allegations and particulars in the FIR so as to constitute any offence, b much less a cognizable offence. 160. The then Minister of Defence, Shri K.C. Pant had stated that \"if any evidence is produced involving violations of the law, the matter will be thoroughly investigated and the guilty, whoever they may be, punished\", and thereafter the then Prime Minister on April 20, 1987 c declared that \"if any evidence proving the involvement of middlemen or payoffs or of bribes or commissions are brought, the Government will not hesitate to take action and will not allow anybody, however high-up, to go free\" which statement. was subsequently re-asserted by the Minister of Defence. The excerpts of both the statements in the Parliament, have d been cited in the earlier part of this judgment. 161. While so, it shocks our judicial conscience that Mr Justice M.K. Chawla before whom no aggrieved or affected party had come challeng- ing the FIR, has taken suo motu action and recorded such a categorical e assertion that 'no offence' thereby meaning much less a cogn.izable offence is made out in the FIR. 162. As pointed out in Nirmaljit Singh Hoon v. State of W.B. 62 that once an investigation by the police is ordered by a Magistrate under Sec- tion 156(3) of the Code, the Magistrate cannot place any limitations or f direct the officer conducting it as to how to conduct the investigation. When that is the position of law, Mr Justice M.K. Chawla, in our consid- ered view, has overstepped his jurisdiction and made the statement which is unwarranted and uncalled for. As we feel that any further deliberation on this matter may affect the merits of the case at any later point of time, g we refrain from making any more observation on this aspect as the mat- ter is at the threshold of the investigation. 163. Therefore, we are constrained to set aside that statement, hold- ing that the opinion of Justice Chawla in this regard has no legal effect or consequence. So far as the rest of the alleged illegalities are concerned, h we straight away say that those grounds are not available for suo motu exercise of power in the light of the well-settled legal principles enun- ciated by this Court for the exercise of such powers. 62 (1973) 3 sec 753: 1973 sec (Cri) 521 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.
