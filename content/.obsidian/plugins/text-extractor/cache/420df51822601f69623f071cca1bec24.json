The right to elect or choose a remedy against the order of the subordinate Court or Tribunal, that is, whether to file a petition under Article 226 or under Article 227 or both under Article 226 and Article 227 of the Constitution rests with the party aggrieved by the said order. When the party has invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226, it is not open to the High Court to exercise jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution when a relief can be granted to the party under the Article invoked. Therefore, there cannot be a test whether the High Court was justified in exercising its powers or the reliefs granted where under Article 227 of the Constitution. Where ·• the facts justify filing an application either under Article 226 or under Article · 227 and the party chooses to file the application urn;ier both these Articles, the Court ought to treat the application as one filed under Article 226 if the substantial part of the order appealed against is under Article 226. If in deciding · such an application under Articles 226 and 22 7 of the Constitution, the Single Judge of the High Court grants ancillary directions which pertain to Article 22 7, then by the reason of such ancillary directions being given in the order, the petition should not be treated as one under Article 2 2 7, but should be treated as one under Article 226, so that a party is not deprived of his valuable right of an intra-Court appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent. 1988 Mh.L.J. 765 andJudgment inL.P.A.No. l 4of 1983,Jaitunbiwd/oMoharnmed Ismail and ors. vs. Halimabi wd/ o Yusuf Baig decided by M.

PATEL, J. :- A common question arose in the aforesaid four Letters Patent Appeals about their maintainability under clause 15 of the Letters Patent (Bombay) before the Division Bench consisting of H. W. Dhabe and A A Desai, JJ. By judgment delivered on 6-2 - 1989, one of the Judges of the Division Bench, namely, Dhabe, J. expressed his opinion by giving reasons that all the four appeals under clause 15 of the Letters Patent are maintainable. The other Judge, that is, Desai, J., however, gave his opinion on 26-11-1992 in the following words : \"Having regard to the view as then taken in the case of Jaitunbi, I hold that the appeals are not maintainable. I, therefore, dismiss the same.'' It become necessary to point out that the case of Jaitunbi wd/ o Mohammed Ismail and others vs. Smt. Halimabi w/o Yusuf Baig, Letters Patent Appeal No. 14 of 1983with other connected appeals was heard and decided by the Division Bench consisting of Qazi and Desai, JJ. on 21-8-1988 . In that case my brother Desai, J. speaking for the Court, held that the Letters Patent Appeals before them were not maintainable. The same view was maintained by Desai, J. even . \"- in these appeals. This was despite the decision of Supreme Court in the case of Sushilabai vs. Nihalchand, AIR. 1992 SC 185 in which the decision of Full Bench of this Court between the same parties reported in 1989 Mh.L.J. 695 on the same point as involved in the present appeals was declared as not a good law holding that its decision in the case of Umaji vs. Smt. Radhikabai and others, AIR 1986 SC 12 72was clear and did not require any interpretation. 2. Since the views expressed by the Division Bench in these appeals were totally different or better still contrary to each other the matter came to be referred to the Full Bench for answering the' question \"Whether Letters Patent Appeals in these cases are maintainable under clause 15 of the Letters Patent?'' 3. The Letters_Patent Appeal No . 90/88 arises from the judgment of the Single Judge in a Writ Petition whereunder the orders passed by the Ceiling Authorities under the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, I 961 are challenged. Similar is the position with respect to Letters Patent Appeal No. 98/88 . Both the Writ Petitions were filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution seeking identical relief of quashing the orders passed by the Ceiling Authorities after calling for the records and examining the legality and propriety of the orders passed by appropriate writ, order or direction. The Letters Patent Appeal No. 124/88, however, ~rises out of proceedings and orders passed under Rent Control Order.

The fourth Appeal bearing Letters Patent Appeal No. 20/83 was placed before the Division Bench for hearing parties in which a preliminary objection regarding its maintainability appears to have been raised by the contesting respondents. The said Letters Patent Appeal arose out of proceedings and order passed under section 3 3-C{ 2) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The order of the Labour Court was challenged in a Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. The relief claimed was the quashing of order passed by Labour Court by appropriate writ, order or direction. 4. It is not for the first time that this controversy is being raised in this Court. The Full Bench of three Judges had occasion to deal with the very same controversy in Letters Patent Appeals Nos. 3, 10, 11, 17 of 1979 and Letters Patent Appeal No. 34/ 80. Shankar vs. Gyanchand. By judgment dated 3-9-1980, it was held that no appeal lies under clause 15 of the Letters Patent against the judgment of the learned Single Judge in a Writ Petition filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. The very same question fell for consideration by the Special Bench of five Judges of this Court in the case of State of Maharashtra vs. Kusum, 1981 Mh.LJ 93. It was held that no appeal lies against the decision of a Single Judge in a proceeding under Article 22 7 of the Constitution. It was also held that a proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution is an original. proceeding and, therefore, an appeal would lie under clause J 5 of the Letters Patent against the judgment of the Single Judge in such proceeding. The Special Bench relying upon the decision in Hari Vishnu Karnath vs. Ahmed Ishaq and others. AIR 1955 SC 233 and agreeing with what has been held in Adialsingh and others vs. Karan Singh and others. AIR 1957 All. 414 (FB)and Raj Kisan Jain vs. Tulsi Das. AIR 1959 Pan. 291 held that where the facts justify a party in filing an application either under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution and the party chooses to file his application under both these Articles, in fairness and justice to such party and in order not to deprive him of the valuable right of appeal, the Court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226, and if in deciding the matter in the final order the Court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 22 7, this would not and ought not to be held, to deprive a party of the right of appeal under clause 15 of the Lett_ers Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to be appealed against is under Article 226 . In view of these conclusions, the Special Bench overruled the decision of the Full Bench in the case of Shankar 1-1s. Gyanchand referred to above, except for its conclusion in that case that no appeal lies under clause 15 of the Letters Patent against judgment of the Single Judge of this Court in a proceeding under Article 227 of the Constitution . 5. The Supreme Court in the case of Umaji vs. Smt. Radhikabai, AIR 1986 SC 12 72 had an occasion to consider the question of maintainability of Letters Patent Appeal wherein they fully approved the view expressed by the Special Bench of this Court in the case of State of Maharashtra vs. Kusum.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 1993Mh.L.J.] JAGDISH vs. STATE OF MAH. 961 of this Court as provided in Rule 18 of the Chapter XVII of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules. The said Rule contemplates Writ Petitions being filed either under Article 226 or Article 227 of the Constitution or both. The subject matter of the Rule 18 clearly indicates that Writ Petitions contemplated therein are against the orders of the Courts or Tribunals which would mean that Writ Petitions against the orders of the Court or Tribunal are contemplated also under Article 226. It is in the context of Rule 18 it was canvassed before the Supreme Court in Umaji 's case whether in respect of orders of the Courts or Tribunals challenged before the High Court under Article 226, the High Court exercises original jurisdiction or revisional jurisdiction which is in the ·nature of power of superintendence _under Arti.cle 227 of the Constitution. 6. In paragraph 12 of the judgment in Umaji 's case the Supreme Court reproduced the conclusions of the Full Bench in the case of Shankar vs. Gyanchand. (cited supra) which has taken a view that no appeal lies under clause 15 of the Letters Patent against judgment of the Single Judge under Article 226 or Article 227 of the _Constitution. One such conclusion of the Full Bench is reproduced in sub-para (8) of para 12 of the judgment of the Supreme Court. The conclusion is that both Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution provide for the same relief, namely, scrutiny of records and the control of subordinate Courts or Tribunals and, therefore, the exercise of jurisdiction under these Articles would fall within the expression \"revisional jurisdiction\" or \"power of superintendence\" and hence even under clause 15 the appeal would be barred. After having traced and considered the history and the scope of jurisdiction of the High Court under Letters Patent and also Writ Jurisdiction of the High Court even prior to the coming into force of the Constitution as a chartered High-,Court and dealing thereafter with the various conclusions arrived by the Full Bench in the case of Shankar vs. Gyanchand, the Supreme Court observed in para 99 that it has misunderstood . the ·scope and effect of the powers conferred by these Articles. It was held that these two Articles stand on entirely different footing and their source and origin are different and the models upon which they are patterned is also different. It also held that the power to issue writs is not the same as the power of superintendence. By no stretch of imagination can a writ of the nature of habeas corpus or mandamus or quo wa\"anto or prohibition or certiorari be equated with the power of superintendence. These are writs which are directed against persons, authorities and the State. The power of superintende- nce corif erred upon every High Court by Article 227 is a supervisory juri$<1iction intended to ensure that the subordinate Courts or Tribunals act within the limits of the authority and according to law. The Supreme Court also observed that simply because the same result can be achieved bytwo different processes, it does not mean that the two processes are the same. 7. The Supreme Court further observed that under Article 226 an order, direction or writ has to be issued to a person, authority or the State and, therefore, such person, authority or State is a necessary·party. Under Article 22 7 what comes up before the High Court is the order or judgment of the subordinate Court or Tribunal for the purpose of ascertaining whether in giving such judgment or-order that subordina!~_i:_<:>_urt Q_r_Tribunal has acted ~ithin R.H. 121 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Maharashtra Law Journal, © 2024 Journal Publications, Nagpur.

It is also held by the Supreme Court that it is firmly established by series of decisions, some of which are quoted in para 100 itself, that a proceeding under Article 226 is an original proceeding. Various authorities are also cited in the very same paragraph to show that they are cases in which the decision of the subordinate Court or Tribunal or Authorities or officers of the State Government exercising quasi judicial functions are challenged in the Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitu- tion. 8. In paragraph 102 of the judgment in Umaji 's case the judgment in the case of Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Company Private Limited vs. Ram Tehal, AIR 19 72 SC J 598is referred in which the Writ Petition was filed under Article 227 and significant observations are made by Supreme Court in regard to the form in which the reliefs are claimed in the Writ Petition in the abovesaid case. It was pointed out that in some High Courts Article 22 7 is utilised for securing relief by way of writs more accurately contemplated by Artid.e 226 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court also observed that it should not be understood to express its approval for use of Article 227 for seeking relief by way of writs or✓directions in the nature of writs for which Article 226 is expressly and in precise language designed. What is to be noted in the observations of the Supreme Court is that although the substance, namely, the facts on which the relief is claimed may be the same, it is the form in which the relief is sought really matters. The language of-Article 226 shows that it is enacted to issue writs, orders or directions in the nature of writs to any. person, authority or in appropriate cases the State Government and, therefore, if the relief is claimed in the same form in which Article 226 is couched and the Courts, Authorities or Tribunals against which the writs are sought are joined as parties, it will clearly indicate that jurisdiction of High Court is invoked under Article 226, notwithstanding the fact that on same facts and circumstances the power of superintendence of the High. Court under Article 22 7 also can be invoked. 9. From the aforesaid discussions and in particular from paragraphs 99 to 105 of Umaji 's case, it is clear that it is possible for aggrieved party to claim a writ of certiorari or any order or direction under Article 226 of Constitution against any inferior or subordinate Court or Tribunal in respect of its order by joining them as necessary party and seeking to remove the records for the purpose of scrutiny and then to quash the order. It is in this background that the petitions are contemplated under Article 226 of the Constitution also by Rule 18 . of Chapter XVII of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules against orders of the subordinate Courts or Tribunals. It is in the context of .the said Rule that the Supreme Court held that where a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution is heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge of the High Court, an intra-Court appeal will lie before the Division Bench of the High Court if so provided by Letters Patent. Therefore, there is no doubt left that in case the petition is filed under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the order of the subordinate Court or Tribunal. an appeal under clause 1 5 of the Letters Patent against the order of Single Judge in such petitions would lie with respect to the orders of such subordinate Court or Tribunal. · · · ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Maharashtra Law Journal, © 2024 Journal Publications, Nagpur.

The Supreme Court in Umaji'scase (para 106) had also dealt with a case where the petition was filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the .Constitution. In considering the questlon whether appeal would lie when the petitions are filled under Articles 226 and 22 7, the test which is made applicable by the Supreme Court is that where the facts justify a party in filing an application either under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution and the party chqoses to file· the application under both the Articles, in fairness and justice to such party and in order not to deprive him of the valuable right of appeal, the Court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226 and if in deciding the matter in the final order the Court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227, this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of order sought to be appealed is under Article 226. 11. The Supreme Court placed reliance upon its own decision in the_ case of Hari Vishnu Karnath vs. Syed Ahmed Jshaque, AIR 1955 SC 233where some distinction between the scope and power of High Court under Article 226 and Article 227 has been brought out. In a petition under Article 226, · the High Court can only annul the order of the Tribunal impugned before it by a writ of certiorari but under Article 227 it can annul the order and also give ancillary or further directions. Hence, it has been laid down by the Supreme Court that while considering the question whether a petition is under Article 226 or not, the consideration that in the final order the Court has given ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 22 7 should not be held to be a factor to deprive the party of the right of appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent. It is in this background that the test stated in earlier· para of this judgment was laid down. 12. We may at this stage l_lsefully refer to the Division Bench decision of this Court in the case of Surekhabai vs. Motilal, 1987 Mh.L.J. 610. In that. case the Letters Patent Appeal arose from the judgment of the learned Single Judge delivered in a Writ Petition filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution wherein the orders passed by the Rent Control Authorities were impugned. The Division Bench considered the decision of Supreme Court in Umaji's case (cited supra) and in particular paragraph 106 thereof held that- if the petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution and the party chooses to file -under both ·these Articles, in f aimess and justice to such party and in order not to deprive him of the valuable right of appeal the Court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226 of the Constitution and thus allow the party aggrieved a right of intra-Court appeal if provided by the Letters Patent. The Division Bench also found that the Rent Control Authorities are quasi-judicial authorities amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution and, therefore, relief could have been granted to the parties in the said case under the said Article. A further observation is also to be found that in construing the contents of the Writ Petition, they should be liberally construed, so as to allow the parties to have a right of ~ppeal rather than construing the same in the manner which would deprive them of the right of appeal. The Letters Patent Appeal was ac~ordingly held to be maintainable. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Maharashtra Law Journal, © 2024 Journal Publications, Nagpur.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 964 JAGDISH vs. STATE OF MAH. ~[ 1993 Mh.L.J. 13. We may now refer to the conflicting views taken by two Division Benches upon which the rival parties in these cases rely in support of their contention that Letters Patent Appeals are not maintainable under clause 15 · of the Letters Patent. Those two decisions are Pushpabai vs. Sukumar, 1988 Mh.L.J. 765 and the unreported judgment in Jaitunbi s case cited supra. 14. Dealing first with Pushpabai 's case, it must be said that the decision in the case of Surekhabai was riot brought to the notice of the Division Bench, though one of the two Judges was a party thereto. The Letters Patent Appeal in this case was preferred against the judgment of the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution against the order passed by the District Court in a suit under the Rent Act. After ref erring to · the judgment of the Special Bench in the case of State of Maharashtra vs. Kusµm, the Division ;Bench held that in a Writ Petition filed against a decree passed by the District Court in a suit under Rent Act, the High Court exercised the power of superintendence under Article 227 of the Constitution and not its power under Article 226 thereof. It was further observed that merely because the petition is styled as one under Article 226, it cannot alter the nature of proceedings or exercise of power by the High Court in Writ Petition. A further observation is also to be found that the dispute in the said case is between private parties and the suit is tried by a Civil Court. It is the substance of the matter which is relevant for determining the question as to whether the High Court exercises its jurisdiction under Article 226 or its power of superintendence under Article 227. The nomenclature is not the criterion to determine the same. 15. For the view which the Division Bench has taken in Pushpabai 's case, reliance was placed upon some of the conclusions drawn by Special Bench of this Court in the case of State of Maharashtra vs. Kusum. The conclusion No. 27 was about Article 226 and Article 227 of the Constitution operating in different field; whereas conclusions Nos. 33 and 34 show that importance has to be given to the substance of the matter and also the nature of reliefs granted. Similarly, reference is also made by the Division Bench to para I 06 of Supreme Court judgment in Umaji's case (cited supra) and observed that the case before them was converse case in which there was no question of any relief being granted under Article 226 of the Constitution and the test for deciding the question of appealability under clause 15 of the Letters Patent was the nature of exercise of powers and not the nomenclature adopted by the petitioner in the petition. It may not be out of place to observe that the view which the Division Bench took in Pushpabai' s case was not in accordance with Kusum •s case. 16. The other conflicting view was taken in Letters Patent Appeal No. 14 of 1983, Jaiiunbi vs. Halimabi which was decided on 21-12-1988 with other connected Letters Patent Appeals. After referring to the decision of Special Bench in State of Maharashtra vs. Kusum and para 106of the judgment of Umaji scase (both cited supra) it was observed that if on facts, the grievance can be or has been entertained exclusively or principally by exercising jurisdi- ction under Article 227, such exercise is not to be presumed one under Article 2 26 so_ as to clothe the party with a right of appeal. It held that as laid down ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Maharashtra Law Journal, © 2024 Journal Publications, Nagpur. SCC Online Web Edition: http://www.scconline.com Printed For: Mr. Hon'ble Mr Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani Page 8 Friday, March 08, 2024 SCC Online Web Edition, © 2024 EBC Publishing Pvt. Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 1993 Mh.L.J.] JAGDISH vs. STATE OF MAH. 965 the two Articles operate in a different field and with a different purpose although in a given case the result to be achieved may be identical. Therefore, when on facts the dispute or grievance can be adjudicated mainly under Article 22 7, then it would not be either just or fair, to treat the proceedings under Article 226, so as to enable a party a remedy of appeal under clause 15. A surprising observation is also to be found in the judgment of the Division Bench in Jaitunbi s case that Supreme Court in Umaji s case approved the decision of the Full Bench of Allahabad High Court in the case of Adial Singh vs. Karan Singh, AIR 1957 All. 414 (F.B.)only to the extent which is in conformity with that expressed by it in para 106. · · 1 7. The Division Bench after observing that the two Articles stand entirely on different footing and operate in different fields, it was held that the two Articles cannot mutually be exchanged by twisting even if the result to be achieved or relief s claimed were analogous. In this context, the Division Bench also observed that the right of appeal under clause 15 cannot be said to have been vested merely by styling the petition under Article 226 or both under Article 226 and Article 227 and/or by articulating the prayer clause by claiming a writ of certiorari. The Division Bench was also of the view that where contractual rights of private parties · under a special statute are decided by Tribunals constituted thereunder, the Writ Petitions filed against the orders of such Tribunal can be looked into by the High Court in exercise of power of superintendence under Article 227 and such proceedings, therefore, cannot ordinarily be original in nature. It aiso held that such grievance does not touch the civil rights of the parties but relate to contractual rights between private parties. According to the Division BeQch, under Article 226, the proceedings being original in nature, the aggrieved party can canvass the grievance relating to the infringement of Civil Right and in such proceedings a wrong doer is a necessary party, may be a person or authority to justify or defend the act complained of. 18. We have exhaustively extracted the ratio of ·the two conflicting decisions in the case of Pushpalxii and also in the case of Jaitunbi and after having given our careful consideration, we cannot persuade ourselves to agree with the basic approach of the Division Benches to the question of right of appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent of this Court as well as the scope and ambit of Article 226 of the Constitution particularly as construed in Jaitunbi 's case and their interpretation of the decision of the Special Bench in Kusum 's case as well as the judgment of the Supreme Court in Umaji 's case. 1 9. A right of appeal in our view arises from original proceedings initiated by a party and that right remains unfettered and does not depend upon the outcome of the original proceedings. It is needless to state at this juncture that when more than one remedy is available to a party in respect of the same grievance, it is open for that party to elect or to choose his remedy. But once he chooses his remedy, all incidents attached to that remedy must follow. To illustrate the point, it would be worthwhile to mention that an employee, who is dismissed from service, can avail of the remedy ·of raising a dispute and then filing an· application under section 78 of .the Bombay Industrial ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Maharashtra Law Journal, © 2024 Journal Publications, Nagpur.

Relations Act or the employee may avail of the other re~edy by straightway filing a complaint seeking a declaration that the management have indulged in unfair labour practice under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act. Once the employee elects one of the two remedies, the consequences would be that the other remedy would be barred. The right of appeal would · depend upon the statute under which the employee has chosen to file the case. If the employee elects to avail of the remedy under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, he will have a right of appeal against the order of the Labour Court to Industrial Court under section 84 of the said Act. However, if the employee elects the remedy of filing a complaint under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions' and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, he has the right of Revision only under the powers of superintendence of the Industrial Court under section 44 of the said Act. It would thus be clear that the right of appeal would be governed by the choice of parties in initiating original proceedings. 20. It may oe that the party who has chosen his remedy may ultimately fail on the ground that the application or petition as filed is misconceived or not maintainable, nonetheless it is open to the party to file an appeal, if provided for in the remedy which he has chosen in order to show that the application or petition filed by him was maintainable. Merely because it is held by a Court or Tribunal that the application is not maintainable under the provisions under which it is made, the party is not deprived of his right of appeal against such order passed because the availability of the right of appeal does not depend upon the nature or the contents of the order passed by the Court or Tribunal . 21. Sometimes it does happen that an appliction is filed under a particular provision of a statute and it is found to be not maintainable thereunder or the Court or Tribunal has no power to grant the relief asked for thereunder but the said application is maintainable under some other provision of the statute before the same Court or Tribunal and it has power to grant the relief asked for, it is in such cases that it has always been held that the \"label\" or the \"nomenclature\" of the application or petition should not matter and after seeing the substance or contents of the application, if it is possible to grant the relief under some other provision of the statute, such a relief should not be denied to a party. It is , however,- material to note that such a recourse is taken only when it is found that the relief asked for cannot be granted under the provisions under which the jurisdiction of the Court or Tribunal is invoked, much less when the result would be to deprive the party of a right of appeal provided against the order passed under such a provision. 22. The aforestated basic principles are also useful in deciding the point in controversy. When · a party aggrieved by an order of the Court or Tribunal desires to challenge the said order under the Writ Jurisdiction of the High Court, that party may choose, and in our view it is the choice of that party, to file a petition either under Article 226 or under Article 22 7 of the Constitution or a petition under both the Articles.

When jurisdiction of the High Court is invoked under Article 226, the primary question that needs to be examined is whether the relief can be granted to the party under that Article. If the High Court finds that the relief can be granted under Article 226 for which its jurisdiction is invoked, it is not open for the High Court to hold that since it can also grant relief under Article 22 7, it will grant the relief to the party under Article 22 7 only because as discussed above, it is the right of the party to choose or elect its remedy as well as the forum. 23. According to us, the approach of the above two Division Benches in holding that the jurisdiction of the High Court though invoked by the party under Article 226, the nomenclature should not matter and after examining the substance of the petition, it should be treated as one under Article 22 7, because the Court or Tribunal whose judgment is impugned before it is subject to the power of superintendence and, therefore, it should be inferred that the High Court has exercised jurisdiction under Article 22 7 and not under Article 226 is not in consonance with the basic principles of law as well as the law laid down by the Court in Kusum 's case as well as by the Supreme Court in Umaji 's case, more particularly when the result of such reasoning is deprivation of the right of appeal to a party who has purposefully chosen to invoke the jurisdiction under Article 226. The party who desires to achieve finality to the litigation may choose to invoke Article 227 simpliciter in which case the intra-Court appeal would be expressly barred under clause 15 of the Letters Patent. 24. It is in the aforesaid circumstances that the Supreme Court in para 106 of Umaji 's case has evolved the test for determining whether there is a right of appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent or not in a petition filed under Article 226 and Article 22 7 of the Constitution. The test evolved is not whether the petition can lie and the relief can be granted under Article 227 of the Constitution but the tesf is whether substantial part of the Writ Petition is maintainable under Article 226. Simply because some ancillary directions or reliefs are also given which may pertain to Article 227, that by itself is not sufficient to deprive the party of its right of appeal under clause 15. The interpretation put forth by the two Division Benches, in Pushpabai 's case as well as Jaitunbi 'scase taking views contrary to judgment of the Supreme Court in Umaji 's case and in particular para 106 thereof is totally incorrect, misdirected and not in consonance with its true meaning and intent. It is not open for the High Court to interpret the judgment of the Supreme Court in the manner as would tend to mo!fify the Supreme Court judgment itself under the guise of interpretation. In this context, it would be appropriate to quote a particular observation from the decision of Supreme Court in the case of G. K. Dudani vs. S. D. Shanna7 AIR 1986 SC 1455:- ::under the guise of interpreting judgment in that case, the Division Bench of the High Court virtually sat in appeal over the judgment of this Court and modified it.

We c~ot hence agree that the test on the question of maintainability of Letters Patent Appeal would be whether the subject matter can be looked into under Artjcle 227 of the Constitution. 25. We may now advert to conclusions Nos. 27, 33 and 34 given in para 120 of Kusum 's case wherein the Special Bench summarised its conclu- sions because the Division Bench in Pushpabai's case has relied upon the conclusions in expressing their view that importance has to be given to the substance of the matter and also to the nature of reliefs granted and the nomenclature used is not the determining factor. The conclusion No. 2 7 is about the operation of Articles 226 and 227 in different fields. It does not convey that the same facts and the same orders of the Subordinate Court or Tribunal cannot be the subject matter of both the Articles. As explained by Supreme Court the difference is in the nature of jurisdiction exercised by the High Court with· reference to the two Articles. In regard to the orders of subordinate Courts or Tribunals impugned before the High_ Court under Article 226, the jurisdiction exercised by it is original jurisdiction, whereas in respect of the same orders if impugned under Article 227 the jurisdiction exercised by the High Court is of the power of superintendence over the said subordinate Courts or Tribunals. By the reason of this basic difference in the nature of jurisdiction, there is a difference in the form of approaching the High Court under these Articles and the manner in which the said jurisdiction is exercised by it. The expression different fields has the relevance to the aforesaid difference in the nature of jurisdiction exercised by the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 and has nothing to do with the ~ubject matter as such or because the same result can be achieved by both the processes as observed by Supreme Court in Umaji's case. If at all the jurisdiction of the High Court were separate and distinct vis-a-vis, the subject matter or with reference to facts in the case, the Supreme Court would not have held in Hari Vishnu Karnath 's case (cited supra) that the Writ Petition in the said case against the order of election tribunal was maintainable under Articles 226 and 227. This view is also approved by Supreme Court in Umaji's case as well. We hence cannot endorse the view expressed in Pushpabai 'scase by the Division Bench as well as by the Division Bench in Jaitunbi 's case that the jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 is separate and distinct in the sense that the subject matter which can lie under Article 227 cannot lie under Article 226. 26. In so far as the conclusions Nos. 33 and 34 of Special Bench in Kusum 's case are concerned, the test laid down is not whether on the same facts the High Court can grant relief under Article 227 but the test that has been laid down is whether on the same facts substantial relief can be granted under Article 226 of the Constitution. This is also the ratio of para 106 of Umaji 's case. Even at the cost of repetition, we again reiterate that the test evolved is whether substantial part of the order appealed against is under Article 226 and if it is so the fact that while passing the final order some ancillary ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Maharashtra Law Journal, © 2024 Journal Publications, Nagpur.

We could not find even with efforts from the judgment of the Special Bench in K usum s case as well as from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Umaji 's case that if the facts show that the jurisdiction of the High Court can be invoked under Article 227 and the relief can be granted to the party under the same Article, the party does not have a right of appeal although it may have invoked the jurisdiction of High Court under Article 226 exclusively or along with Article 22 7. With great respect to the learned Judges, we conclude that the approach of the Division Benches either in the case of Pushpalxli or in the case of Jaitunbi is not in consonance with the principles laid down by the Special Bench of this Court in Kusum 's case or by the Supreme Court in Umaji 's case. 2 7. In support of what has been discussed above, we take this opportunity for ref erring to some of recent judgments of the Supreme Court taking similar· view as discussed above. One such decision is in the case of Sushilabai vs. -Nihalchand, AIR. 1992 SC 185. We have already made a reference to this decision earlier. By this decision, the view taken by the Full Bench of this Court in between the same parties reported in 1989 Mh.L.J. 695 (FB) was reversed. The point in controversy was the maintainability of the Letters Patent Appeal. Though the Writ Petition was filed under Articles 226 and 1227, the Full Bench of this Court after laying down the guidelines directed the matter to be placed before the Division Bench to decide on the question of maintainabi- lity of the Letters Patent Appeal. It may be relevant to observe here that reference was made by the Full Bench to the decision of the Division Bench in the case of Pushpabai as well as the·decision of the Division Bench in the case of Jaitunbi. The Division Bench by a cryptic order held that the impugned judgment of the leametl Single Judge indicated that in truth and substance the order was passed under Article 227. It was hence held that the appeal was not maintainable. The Supreme Court again relying upon para 106 of the decision in Umaji 's case, set aside the judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court holding that the Letters Patent Appeal was maintainable. It may be relevant to point out here that the Full Bench decision of this Court was not held to be a gooq law and that includes the case of Pushpabai as well as the case of Jaitunbi because of the ultimate finding given by the Supreme Court. In any event, the efficacy of the two judgments of the Division Benches was lost much before the differing judgments in these appeals were delivered. 28. The other decision of Supreme Court is in the case of Mangalbhai vs. Dr. Radheyshyam, 1993 Mh.L.J. (S.C.).567 = AIR 1993 SC 806. In this case the Writ Petition was filed under Articles 226 and 227 challenging the orders passed by Rent Control Authorities under the Rent Control Order. The Single Judge of the High Court took a view that it would be proper to remand the case to the Rent Controller for determining the extent of the need of the petitioner (respondent) for his residence and clinic/ dispensary and also for examining the case of the petitioner to reconstruct the house. Other directions like granting full opportunity to amend pleadings and to lead evidence was · also given. Aggrieved by the orders passed, the tenants filed the Letters Patent Appeal before the Division Bench of this Court. The Division Bench dismissed R.F.

[ 1993 Mh .L.J. the appeal taking a view that in truth and substance the order was passed by the learned Single Judge under Article 227 of the Constitution against which the Letter~ Patent Appeal was not maintainable. The Supreme Court observed that the learned Single Judge after examining the matter on merits set aside the orders passed by the Rent Control Authorities on the ground that the two orders were perverse. The findings of the Rent Control Authorities were set aside on the question of habitual defaulter as well as on the ground of bona fide need. On examining the totality of facts and circumstances of the case, the pleadings of the parties in Writ Petition and the judgment of the learned Single Judge, the Supreme Court held that the above factors leave no manner of doubt that it was an order passed under Article 226 of the Constitution and in that view of the matter, the Letters Patent Appeal was maintainable. 29. The third and the last decision on the point of maintainability of the Letters Patent Appeal is in the case of Ratnagi,ri District Centtal Co-operative Bank Ltd. vs. Dinkar Kashinath Watve, 1993 Supp. ( 1) SCC 9. The question before the Supreme Court was whether the High Court was right in holding that Letters Patent Appeal will not lie against the judgment delivered by the Single Judge in the petition which was filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court relying upon para 106 of the decision in Umaji 's case held that the relief granted by the Single Judge clearly indicates that he was exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 and nor under Article 227 of the Constitution and in this view of the matter and in the light of what has been laid down in Umaft 's case, the Letters Patent Appeal under clause 15 would be maintainable before the Division Bench of the High Court. It seems that after the case was remanded to the Division Bench, it was also disposed of on merits and the decision is reported in 1989 Mh.L.J 445. The facts as available are that the services of the employee were terminated by the Bank on 1-6-1966. The employee approached the Bank on 31-8-1966. The Bank denied the claim put forth in approach letter. The employee approached the Bank for the second time on 1-11-1974 and then he filed · an application before the Labour Court on 31-1-1975 seeking relief of setting aside the order of termination and for grant of consequential reliefs. Simulta- neously, an application for condonation of delay was also made. The Labour Court held that the punishment of termination of service was disproportionate on a solitary charge that was proved in an enquiry. It granted back wages and compensation in lieu of reifistatemerit. The appeal was allowed by the Industrial Court. The Writ Petition of the employee filed under Articles 226 and 227 was allowed. It was against this judgment of the Single Judge the Letters Patent Appeal was filed. The relief granted by the Single Judge was held to be in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 and not under Article 227. 30. We hence formulate our conclusions as given below:- (i) The right to elect or choose a remedy against the order of the subordinate Court or Tribunal, that is, whether to file a petition under Article 226 or under Article 22 7 or both under Article 226 and Article 227 of the Constitution rests with the party aggrieved by the said order. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Maharashtra Law Journal, © 2024 Journal Publications, Nagpur.

Therefore, there cannot be a test whether the High Court was justified in exercising its powers or the reliefs granted where under Article 227 of the Constitution. (iii) Where the facts justify filing an application either under Article 226 or under Article 227 and the party chooses to file the application under both these Articles, the.Court ought to treat the application as one filed under Article 226 if the substantial part of the order appealed against is under Article 226. If in deciding such an application made under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, the Single Juge of the High Court grants ancillary directions which pertain to Article 227, then by the reason of such ancillary directions being given in• the order, the petition should not be treated as one under Article 2 2 7, but should be treated as one under Article 226, so that a party is not deprived of his valuable right of an intra-Court appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent. 31 . We hence answer the question that in our view all the four Appeals under clause 15 of the Letters Patent are maintainable.
