It is true that Lahore and Delhi High Courts have taken a different view. But the view taken by the Calcutta and Mysore High Courts caiinot be said to be untenable view. Hence, particularly in view of the fact that we are interpreting, not merely a taxing provision but a penalty provision as well, the interpretation placed by the Calcutta and Myaore High Courts cannot be rejected. Further as seen earlier, the consequences of accepting the interepretation placed by the Revenue may lead to harsh results. II.

At the relevant time he wu functioning as Commissioner of Hindu Religious Endowments, Orissa. The office of the Com.missioner is created by the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act. 2. In village Sanabagalpur there are two deities. The Additional Assis- tant Commissioner of Hindu Religious Endowments took action under Sec- tion 27 of the said Act for appointing an interim trustee of the deities. The penon inch\"\"le of the deities made an objection under Section 41 of the said Act that the ,~et did not apply as the deities were consecrated under a private endowment made by him. The .Additional Assistant Commissioner rejected the objection by his order, dated July 26, 1967. Without making any inquiry under Section 41 he held that prima facie there was a public endowment. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The objector filed a revision under Section 9 of the said Act before the appellant. 3. During the period intervening between the rejection or the objection by the Additional Assistant Commissioner and the filing or the revision by the objector, the identical issue was raised before the Orissa High Court in Blaramarba, Santro and Ot\"4rs v. Stau of Orissa and Otlurs. 1 In that case the High Court held that the A.uistant Commissioner cannot appoint an interim trustee under Section 27 of the said Act until he has held an inquiry under Section 41 and has found that there was no hereditary trustee of the religious institution. -i. At the hearin~ of the revision, the aforesaid decision was cited before the appellant by the applicant. After hearing the parties, the appellant made the foil owing order : u 1.. .... It is said on behalf of the petitioner that he has filed a petition under Sectic,n 41 of the Act. But no evidence is produced to that effect, thereby disclosing that their plea is humbug. The next argument is that the learned A.uistant Commissioner should have first decided that the institution has no hereditary trustee. The Assistant Commissioner has impliedly done so. 2. The next argwnent that without a final declaration as to the nature of the institution, no appointment under Section 27 can be made, does not seem to be correct. The decision in the High Court on Bantala cue would not be applicable to this instance. Further against the order, we have moved the Supreme Court, and as such, the matter can be safely deemed to be sub judice. 3. In order to establish that the petitioner is the hereditary trustee, he has to file an application under Section 41 of the Act. No doubt the court can initiate such a proceeding. But we should not do it where the inatitution appears to be safely a public one, in this instance, a Siva temple.•' 5. The applicant filed a writ petition in the High Court against this order. The Division Bench, on hearing the aeplicant, issued notice for contempt of the High Court to the appellant. The High Court took exception to the following sentence occurring at the end of Paragraph 2 in his order : \"Further, against the order we have moved the Supreme Court, and aa such, the matter can be safely deemed to be sub judice.,, 6. The appellant appeared before the High Court in response to the notice. According to him the apparently objectionable sentence in his order \"was not at all the basis for (his) decision\". He said that the revision was dismissed by him after distinguishing the case before him from the facts of Bliromarbar Santro case (supra). He further pleaded H that under the Constitution the decisions of the Supreme Court are law of the land. So, I bona fide, was of the opinion that when a matter is under appeal, or otherwise before the Supreme Court, the point of law, becomes sub judice and only a decision of the Supreme Court m the matter, would be binding on the Subordinate Court\". It was also pleaded that the proceeding before him was an administrative proceeding and that the act of not following the decision of the High Court in such a proceedlll;g \"may not amount to contempt of court\".

It was held that the appellant ''refused to follow\" the decision in Bhramarba, Sanlra cas• (supra). The High Court further held that \"we do not find any trace of bona fides of the contemner in the order, dated January 19, 1970 ...... The contemner is a senior judicial officer who has already put in 23 years of service ; having been recruited as a Munsif he has now risen to the rank of District Judge. We regret to find that though he has functioned as a judicial official for about 23 y_ean he has not been able to pick up the approach and attitude of a judicial officer and has actuated by the bias so often manifested in actions of the executive today while disposing of a judicial proceeding and when found fault with has come up with the stand that he was acting adminiJtratively 0 • 8. After examining the matter further, the High Court said : \"The conduct of the contemner far from being bona fide is clearly a mala fide one and he intenionally avoided to follow the deci::ion of this Court by advancing grounds which were most inappropriate''. On that view of the matter the High Court found him guilty of contempt of court and admonished him in open court and directed him to pay Rs. 300/- as costs of the proceedings. 9. Shri Daphtary, counsel for the appellant, rightly did not seek to support the justificatory pleas. His argument now is that the appellant is- not guilty of Contempt of Court, for the sentence in the appellant's order, found objectionable by the High Court, neither interferes with the administration of justice nor scandaliles the High Court. 10. Shri Daphtary as well as the Solicitor-General appearing for the State have stated before us that there is no decided case either in support of or against the argument. But the absence of a precedent should not preclude an act being held to be contempt merely because it is novel or unusual provided it is comprehended by the principles underlying the law of Contempt of Court. The absen~e of precedent should however put the court on guard that the area of contempt is not being unduly expanded (Vide 17 CorpmJuris Secundum 21). The present case then is to be decided on principles and analogy. 11. Contempt of Court is disobedience to the court, by acting in opposition to the authority, justice and dignity thereof. It signifies a wilful diaregard or diaobedience of the court's order ; it alao signifies such conduct as tends to bring the authority of the court and the administration of law into disrepute. [Vide 17 Corpus Juris Secundum pages 5 and 6; Contempt by Edward N. Dangel (1939 Edn.), page 14, Oswald's Contempt of Court (1910 Edn.), pages 5 and 6]. 12. It ii a common place that where the superior court's order staying proceedings is diaobeyed by the inferior court to whom it is addressed, the latter court commit.a contempt of court fpr it acts in diaobedience to the authority of the former court. The act of disobedience is calculated to undermine public respect for the superior court and jeopardise the preservation of law and order. The appellant's case is to be examined in the light of the foregoing principles and analogy. IS.

The appellant has thus made a wrong statement of fact. Secondly, the use of the personal pronoun uwe\" is also significant. It indicates that the appellant identified himself as a litigant in the case and did not observe due detachment and decorum as a quasi- judicial authority. Lastly, we agree with the High Court that it is not possible to believe that tht appellant could have entertained the view that as soon as a petition for certificate to appeal to the Supreme Court was filed in the High Court against its decision, the binding character of the decision disappeared. He has had 23 years' judicial experience and he could scarcely entertain that belief. We agree with the High Court that the appellant deliberately avoided to follow its decision by giving wrong and illegitimate reasons and that his conduct was uclearly mala tide\". 1-i. Under Article 227 of the Constitution, the High Court is vested with the power of superintendence over the courts and tribunals in the State. Acting as a quasi-judicial authority nnder the Ori.ssa Hindu Religious Endowments Act, the appellant was 1ubject to the superintendence of the High Court. Accordingly the decisions of the High Court were bindil\\g on him. He could not get away from them by adducing factually wrong and illegitimate reasons. In East India CommnciaJ Co., Ltd. Calrntta and Another v. Tiu Coluetor of Customs, Cal&utta. 1 Subba Rao, J., observed: \"The Division Bench of the High Court held that a contravention of a condition imposed by a licence issued under the Act is not an offence under Section 5 of the Act. This raises the question whether an administrative tribunal can ignore the law declared by the highest court in the State and initiate proceedings in ditect violation of the law so declared. Under Article 215, every High Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself. Under Article 226, it has a plenary power to issue orders or writs for the enforcement of the fundamental rights and for any other purpose to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases any Government, within its territorial jurisdiction. Under Article 227 it has jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises juriadiction. It would be anomalous to suggest that a tribunal over which the High Court has superintendence can ignore the law declared by that court and start proceedings in direct violation of it. If a tribunal can do so, all the subordinate courts can equally do so, for there is no specific provision, just like in the case of Supreme Court, making the law declared by the High Court binding on 1ubordinate courts. It is implicit in the power of supervision conferred on a superior tribunal that all the tribunals subject to its supervision should conform to the law laid down by it. Such obedience would also be conducive to their smooth working ; otherwise there would be confusion in the administration of law and respect for law would irretrievably suffer.\" 15. The conduct of the appellant in not following the previous decision of the High Court is calculated to create confusion in the :1dministration of law. It- will undermine respect for law laid down by the High Court and impair the constitutional authority of the High Court. His conduct is 2.

The analogy of the inferior court's disobedience to the specific order of a superior court aoo sµggests that his conduct falls within the purview of the law of Contempt. Just as the disobedience to a specific order of the Court undermines the authority and dignity of the oourt in a particular case, similarly the deliberate and mala tide conduct of not following the law laid down in the previous decision undermines the constitutional authority and respect of the ~h Court. Indeed, while the former coo duct has repercus- sions on an individual case and on a limited number of persons, the latter conduct has a much wider and more disastrous impact. It is calculated not only to undermine the constitutional authority and respect of the High Court, generally, but is also likely to subvert the Rule of- Law and engender hara.uing uncertainty and confusion in the administration of law. 16. Our view that a deliberate and a mala tide conduct of not following the binding precedent of the High Court is contumacious does not unduly enlarge the domain of contempt. It would not stifle a bona fide act of distin- guishing the binding precedent, even though it may turn out to be mistaken. 17. & a re.1ult of the foregoing discussion, we think that the High Court has rightly found the appellant guilty of contempt.
