M filed a suit at Asansol against H for recovery of money. Later, H filed a counter suit at Indore againtst M for recovery of money. In the Asansol suit one of the defences rai•ed by H was that the A.ansol court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. H applied to the Asansol court to stay the suit but the court refused the prayer. An appeal to the Calcutta High Court against the refusal to stay was dismissed with the direction that the preliminary issue of juri•diction should be disposed of by the trial court immediately. Thereupon, H applied to the Indore court for an injunction to ttstrain M from proceeding with the Asansol suit pending the disposal of the Indore suit and the court purporting to act under 0. 39 Code of Civil Proce- dure granted 1 he injunction. M appealed to the Madhya Bharat High Court which dismissed the appeal holding that though 0. 39 was not applicable to the case the 01 der of injunction could be made undrr the inhrrent powers of the court under s. 151 Code of Civil Procedure. Held, that the order of injunction was wrongly granted and should be vacated.

There was no prohibition in s. 94 against the grant of a temporay injunction in circumstances not covered by 0. 39. But inherent powers were not to be exercised when their cirercisc was in conflict with the express provisions of the Code or was against the intention of the legislature. Such powers were to be exercised in very exceptional circumstances. A plaintiff of a suit in another jurisdiction could only be res- trained from proceeding with hi1 suit if the suit was vexatious and useless. It was not so in the present case. It was pro- per that the issue as to jurisdiction should be decided by the Asansol court as directed by the Calcutta High Court. The Indore court could not decide this issue. Besides, it was open to the Asansol court to ignore the order of the Indore court and to proceed with the suit. This would place Min an impos- sible position. An order of a court should not lead to such a result. Varadacharlu v. Narsimha Oharlu, A. I. R. 1926 Mad. 258 ; Govindarajalu v. Imperial Bank of India, A. I. R. 1932 Mad. 180 ; Karuppayya v.

RAGIIUBAR DAYAL, J.-The appellant and the respondent entered into a partnership at Ir1dore for working con,! mines at Kajora gram (District Burdwan) and manufacture of cement etc., in the name and style of 'Diamond Industries'. The head office of the partnership was at Indore. The partnership wus diss0lvcd by a deed of dissolution dated Angust 22, 1945. Under the terms of this deed, the appellant ma.de himself liable to render full, correct and true account of all the moneys advanced by the respondent and also to render accounts of the said partner- ship and its busincs~. and waR held entitled to I/4th of Rs. 4,.00,000/- solely contributed by the respondent tow~rds the capital of the partner- ship. He was, however, not entitled to get this amount unlesR ancl until he had rend<'red the accounts and they had been checked and audited. The second proviso at the end of the conven- anta in the deed of dissolution reads: \"Provided however and it is agreed by and between the parties that as the parties entered into the partnership agreement at Indore (Holkrr State) all disputes and differe· ncee whether regarding money or aa to the relationship or as to their rightB and liabili- ties of the parties hereto in respect of the • • ., I \\ (l) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 453 partnership hereby dissolved or in respect of questions arising by and under this docu. ment shall be decided amicably or in court aG Indore and at nowhere else.\" On Sepetember 29, 1945, a registered letter on behalf of the respondent was sent to the appe. Hant. This required the appellant to explain to and satisfy the respondent at Indore as to the accounts of the said colliery within three months of the receipt of the notice. It was said in the notice that the accounts submitted by the appellant had not been properly kept and that many entries appeared to be wilfully falsified, evideuUy with malafide intentions and that there appeared in the account books various false and fictitious entries causing wrongful loss to the respondent and wrongful gain to the appellant. '.l'he appellant sent a reply to' this notice on December 5, 1935, and denied the' various allegations, and requested the respondent to meet him at Asansol or Kajorag· ram on any day suitable to him, within ten days from the receipt of that letter. On August 18, 1948, the appellant instituted Suit M. S. No. 33 of 1948 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Asansol againt the respon· dent for the recovery of Rs. 1,00,000/· on account of his share in the capital and assests of the part· nership firm 'Diamord Industries' and Rs. 18,000/· as interest for detention of the money or as dama. ges or compensation for wrongful withholding of the payment. In the plaint he mentioned about the respondent's notice and his reply and to a second letter on behalf of the respondent and his own reply thereto. A copy of the deed of dissolu- tion, according to the statement in paragraph 13 _of the plaint, was filed along with it.

Thie application wa11 rE>jected on August 20, 1949. llleanwhile, on ,January 3, 1949, the respon· dent filed Civil Original Suit No. 71 of 1949 in the Court of the District Judge, Indore, against the appellant, and prayed for a decree for Rs. 1,90, 519-0-!i against the appellant and further interest on the footing of settled accounts and in the alternative for a direction to the appellant to render true and full accounts of the partnership. Ou November 28, 1949, the respondent filed .ilia written statement in the Aeansol Court. Para- graphs 19 and 21 of the written statement are : \"19. With reference to paragraph 21 of the plaint, the defendant denies that the plaintiff has any cause of action against the defendant or that the alleged cause of action, the existence of which is denied, arose at Kajora Colliery.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 455 In December 1951, the respondant applied in the Court at Asansol for the stay of that suit in the exercise of its inherent powers. The appli- cation was rejected on August 9, 1952. The lear- ned Sub-Judge held : \"No act done or proceedings taken as of right in due course of law is 'an abuse of the process of the Court' simply because such proceeding is likely to embarass the other party.\" He therefore he Id that there could be no scope for acting u11der s. 151, Code of Civil Proce- dure, as s. 10 of that Code had no application to the suit, it having been instituted earlier than the suit at Indore. The High Court of Calcutta con- firmed this order on May 7, 1953, and said: \"We do not think that, in the circum- stance of these cases and on the materials on record, those orders ought to be revised. We would not make any other observation lest it might prejudice any of the parties.\" The High Court further gave the following direction: \"As the preliminary issues, Issue No. 1 in the two Asansol suits have been pending for over two years, it is only desirable that the said issues should be heard out at once. We would, accordingly, direct that the hear- ing of the said issues should be taken up by the learned Subordinate Judge as expedi· tiously as possible and the learned Subordi- nate Judge will take immediate steps in that direction.\" Now we may refer to what took place in tho Indore suit till then. On April 28, 1950, the appellant applied to the Indore Court for staying that suit under ss. 10 and 151 Code of Civil Procedure. J!Jft Marwhar(al,Oh,P v. R4i Bahadu'f:.

T,h.11 application wa.s opposed by tho respondent on three grounds. Th\" fir8t ground wa.s that accord- ing to tho term in t.he <lccd of dis~olution, thflt Court a.lone could dccido the disputes. The second was that under the provisions of the Civil Proce- dure Code in force in Madhya Bharat, the court a.t Asansol wns not a.n intcma.l Court 11nd that t.he suit file<! in Asa.nsol Court could not hnvc the effect ofsta.y- ing the .proceedings of that suit. The third wns that the two suits were of different nature, their subject matter and relief cl11imcd being diff<'rP11t. Th<' application for stay w'ls rejc,cted on July 5, l!J.'il. The Court mainly rclkcl rm the provisions of t.he Second prnviso in the deed of dissolution. The High Court of Madhya Bharat confirmed that order on August 20, 1953. The position then, after August 20, 1953, was that the proceedings in both the suits were to eontimw, and that the Asansol Court had been directed to hear the issue of jurisdiction a.t an early date. It was in these circumstances that tho res- pondent applied under s. 151, (',ode of Civil Proce- dure on September 14, 1953, to the Indore Court, for restraining the a.ppella.nt from continu- ing the proceedings in the suit filed by him in the Court a.t Asa.nsol. The respondent alleged that tho appellant filed tho suit a.t Asansol in order to put him to trouble, heavy ex:ponses and wastage of time in going to Asa.nsol and that he wa.s taking st,eps for the continua.nee of the suit filed in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Asansol. The a.ppella.nt contested this application and stated that he wa.s within his rights to institute the suit a.t Asansol, that that Court was competent to try It 'Ind that the point had been decided by over- ruling the objections raised by the respondent a.nd that the respondent's objection for the stay or (I) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 457 proceedings in tho Court at Asansol ha~ beei;i reje_c- ted by that Court. He denied that his ob1ect rn instituting the suit was to cause trou hie and heavy expenses to tho respondent. It may be mentioned that the respondent di<l not sttite in his application that his application for the stay of the suit at Asansol had been finally dismissed by the High Court of Calcutta and that that Court had directed the trial Court to decide the issue of jurisdiction at an early date. The appellant, too, in his objections, did not specifi- cally state that the order rejecting the respondent's stay application had been confirmed by the High Court'at Calcutta and that that Court had directed for an early hearing of the issuA of jurisdiction. The learned Additional District Judge, Indore, issued interim injunction under 0. XXXIX, Code of Civil Procedure, to the appellant restraining him from proceeding with his Asansol suit pend· ing decision of the Indore suit, as the appellant was proceeding with the . suit at Asansol in spite of the rejection of his application for the stay of the suit at Indore, and, as the appellant wanted to violate the provision in the deed of dissolution a.bout the Indore Court being the proper forum for deciding the dispute between the parties. Against this order, the appellant went in appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Madhya Bharat, contending that the Additional District Judge erred in ·holding that he was competent to issue such an interim injunction to the appellant under 0. XXXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure and that it was a fit case for tl:ie issue of such an injunction and that, considel'ing ·the provisions of O. XXXIX, the order was without jurisdic- tion. The High Court dismissed the appeal by its order dated May 10,1955. The learned Judges agreed with the conwntion tha,t Q. :XXXIX, r. 1, did not 11161 Ala :Qharlal Chopra v. .

They, however, held that the order of injunction could be issued in the cx<'rcisc of the inherent powers cf the Court undt'r s. 151, C.P.C. It is against thiR order that the appel- la.nt has preferred this appl'al, by special leave. On behalf of the appcllaut, two main questions have been raised for consideration. The first is that the Court could not exercise its inherent powers when there were specific provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure for the issue of interim in- junctione, they being s. 04 and 0. XXXIX. The other question is whether the Court, in the ex- ercise of its inherent jurisdiction, exercised its discretion properly, keeping in mind the facts uf the case. The third point which came up for discussion at the hearing related to the legal effect of the second proviso in the deed of dissolution 011 the maintainability of the suit in the Court at Asansol. We do not propose to express any opinion un this question of jurisdiction as it is the subject matter of an issue in tho suit at Asa.nsol and also in the suit at Indore and because that issuo had not yet been decided in any of the two suits. On the first question it is argued for the appel- lant that the provision• of cL (c) of s. 94, Code of Civil Procedure make it clear that interim injunc- tions can be issued only if a provision for their issue is made under the rules, as they provide that a Court may, if it is so prescribed, grant temporary injuncti(lns in order to prevent the ends of justice from being defeated, that thP. worrt 'prescribed', according tu s. 2, means 'vrcscribcd by rnles' and that rr. 1 and 2 of O. XX XIX lay down certain cir- cumstances in which a temporary injunction may be issued. There is difference of opinion between the High Courts on this point. One view is that a Court , I (1) s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 4.59 cannot issue an order of temporary injunction if the circumstances do not fall within the provisions of Order XXXIX of the Code: Varadacharlu v. Nar- simha Oharlu ('), Go1Jindarajuluv. Imperial' Bank of India ('), Karuppayya v. Ponnuawami ('), Murugesa Mudali v. Angamuthu Mudali (') and Subramanian v. Seetarama ('). The other view is that a Court can issue an interin injunction under circumstances which a.re not covered by Order XXXIX of the Code, if the Court is of opinion that the interests of justice require the issue of such in- terin injunction: Dhaneshwar Nath v. Ghnnshyam Dhar ('), Firm Bichchha Ram v. Firm Baldeo Sahai ('), Bhagat Singh v. Jagbir Sawhney (') and Chinese Tannery Owners' Association v. Malekan Lal('). We are of opinion that the latter view. is correct and that the Courts have inherent jurisdic- tion to issue temporary injunctions in circumstances which are not covered by the provisions of O.XXXIX, Code of Civil Procedure. There is no such expression in s. 94 which expressly prohibits the issue of a temporary injunction in circumstances not covered by 0. XXXIX or by any rules made under the Code. It is well-settled that the provisions of the Code are not exhaustive fo~ the simple reason that the Legislature is incapable of contemplating all the possible circumstances which may a.rise in future litigation and consequently for providing the procedure for them. The effect of the expression •if it is so prescribed' is only this that when the rules prescribe the circumstances in which the temp- orary injunction can be issued, ordinarily the Court is not to use its inherent powers to make the necessary orders in the interests of justice, but is merely to see whether the circumstances of the case bring it within the prescribed rule. If the provisions of s. 94 (1) A.l.R. 1926 Mad. 258. (2) A.LR. 1932 Mad. 186. (3) A.I.R. 1933 Mad. 500 (2). (4) A.I.R. 1938 Mad. 190. (5) A.I.R. 1949 Mad. 104, (6) A.l.R. 1940 All. 185.

No party has a right to insiRt on the Court's exercising that jurisdiction and the Court exercises its inhrrent jurisdiction only when it considera it absolutely necrFsary for the enrls of justice to do so. It is in the incidence oft.he exercise of the powi>r of the Conrt to iss1w trmporarv injunction thnt. the provi- sions of~. 94 of t.h<l Corlr have thrir effect anrl not in taking away the right of the Court to exercise its inherent power. There is nothin!: in 0. XXXTX, rr. I and 2, which provido specifically thcit a temporary injunc- tion is not to bo issued in cases which are nllt ruen- t.ioned in thoso rulrs. The rules only provitie that in circumstances mentioned in them the Coul't may grant a temporary injunction. Further, the provisions of~. 151 of the CJde make it clear that the inherent powers are nut con. trolled by the provisions of the Code. Section 151 reads: 'Nothing in this Corle shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the onds of the justice or to prevent abuse of the process of tho Court.\" A similar question about the powers of the Court to issue a commission in the exercise of its powers under s. 151 of the Code in circumstances not covered by s. 75 and Order XXVI, aruse in Padam Sen v. The State of Uttar Pmdesh (') and this Court held that the Court can issue a commis- .sion in such circumstances. It observed at page 887 thus: \"The inherent powers of the Court are in addi- tion to the powers· s.pecifically conferred Oil (II [1961] I S.C.R. 884, -- (I) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 46i the Court by the Code. They are complemen- tary to those powers and therefore it must be held that the Court is free to exercise them for the purpose mentioned in s. 151 of the Code when the exercise of those powers is not in any way in conflict with what has 'been expressly provided in the Code or against the intentions of the Legislature.\" These observations clearly mean that the inherent powers are not in any way controlled by the pro- visions of the Code as has been specifically stated in s. 151 itself. But those powers are not to be ex- ercised when their exercise may be in confJict with what had been expressly provided in the Code or against the intentions of the Legislature. This restriction, for practical purposes, on the exercise of these powers is not because these powers are con- trolled by the provisions of the Code but because it sJiould be presumed that the procedure specifically provided by the Legislature for orders in certain circumstances is dictated by the interests of justices. In ihe above'tlase, thi11 Court did not uphold the order of the Civil Court, not coming under the provisions of Order XXVI, appointing a commissio- ner for seizing the account books of the plaintiff on the application of the defandants. The order was held to be defective not because the Court had no power to appoint a commissioner in circumstances not covered bys. 75 and O. XXVI, but because the power was exercised not with respect to .matters of procedure but with respect to a matter affecting the substantive rights of the plaintiff. This is clear from the further observations made at page 887·. This Court said : \"The question for determination iS whether the impugned order of the Additional Munsif appointing Shri Raghubir Pershad Commissio- ner for seizing the plaintiff's books of account 1961 Manoharlal Chopra v.

These powers are not powers over the su bstn.ntive rights which any litigant pos- sesses. Specific powers have to be conferred on the Conrts for passing such orders which would affect such rights of a party. Such powers cannot come within the scope of in- herent powers of the Court in matters of procedure, which powers ha vc their aouroe in the Court possessing all the esgential r,owers to regulate its practice and procedure. ' The case reported as .Maqbul Ahmad Pratap Nwnin Singh (') does not lay down that the in- herent powers of the Court are controlled by the provisions of the Code. It simply bolds that the s.tatutory discretion possessed by a Court in somo limited reFpects under an Act does not imply that the Court possesses a general discretion to dispense with tho provisions •of that Act. In that ca11e, an application for the preparation of a final decree was presented by the decree-holder beyond the period of limitation prescribed for the presentation of such an application. It was however contended that the Court poSBessed some sort of judicial disr.rr.tion which would enable it to rf'lieve the decree-holder from the operation of the Limita- tion Act in a caso of hardship. To rebut this con- tention, it was a&id at page 8i : \"It is enough to say that there is no authority to support the proposition contended for. In their Lordships' opinion it is impossible to hold that, in a matter which is governed by Act, an Act which in some limited respecta givee the Court a statutory discretion, there ca.n be (I) L. R. 62 l. A. 80: -- (1) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 463 implied in the Court, outside the limits of the Act, a general discretion ~o dispense with its provisions. It is to be noted that this view is supported by the fact that s. 3 of the Act is peremptory and that the duty of the Court is to notice the Act and give effect to it, even though it is not referred ty> in the ple%dings''. These observations have no bearing on the question of the Court's exercising its inherent ·powers under s. 151 of the Code. The section itself says that noth- ing in th@ Code shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the Court to make orders necessary for the ends of justice. In the face of such a clear statement, it is not possible to hold that the provisions of the Code control the inherent power by limiting it or otherwise affecting it. The inherent power has not been confeITed upon the Court; it is a power inherent in the Court by virtue of its duty to do justice between the parties before it.. Further, when the Code itself recognizes the exiAtence of t'l\\e inherent power of thi> Court, there is no question of implying any powers outside the limits of the Code. We therefore repel the first contention raised for the appellant. On the second question, we are of opinion that in view of the facts of the case, the Courts below were in error in issuing a temporary injunction to the appellant restraining him from proceeding with the suit in the Asansol Court. The inherent powers are to be exercised by the Court in very exceptional circumstances, for which the Code lays down no, procedure. The question of issuing an order to a party restraining him from proceeding with any other suit in a regularly constituted Court of law deserves 1961 Manoharlal Chupra V, Rai Bahadur Rao Raja SeJh Hir.ilal Raghuhar Dayal J, 1961 /'i{aMharlal C~oprn •• R•i B.MduT llao Roj4 Sith Hiralal RaghubM Da;al J, 464 SlTPRE!IIE COURT JlEPORTS [1962] SUPP. great ca.re and consideration and such an order is not tu bo made unless absolutely essential for the en<ls of justice . In this conncctio11, reference mu,y usefully be ma<le to what was said in Cohen v. RothfieU (') and which ca.so appears to have influenced the dccidion of the Courts in this country in the matter of iEsuing such injunction orders. Scrutton, L. J., BB.id at page 413: \"Where it is proposed to stay an action on the ground that another is pending, and the action to be stayed is not in the Court asked to make the order, the same result is obtained by restraining the person who is bringing the second action from proceedings with it. But, as the effect is to interfere with proceedings in another jurisdiction, this power should be exercised with great caution to avoid oven the appearance of undue inter- ference with another Court''. And a.gain, at page 4 l 5 : \"While, therefore, there is jurisdiction to restrain a defendant from suing a.broad, it is a. jurisdiction very rarely exercised, and to be resorted to with great care and on ample evidence produced by the applicant that the a.otion a.broad is really vexatious and u11-0less.'' The principle enunciated for a. plaintiff in a. earlier instituted suit to successfully urge a. restraint ordor against a. subsequent suit instituted by the dcfon. dant, is sta.tod thus in this case, at page 415 : \"It appears to me that unless the appli. cant satisfies the Court that no advantage can be gained by the defendant by proceeding with the action in which he is plaintiff in another pa.rt of the King's dominions, the Court should not stop him from proceeding (I) L. R. [1919) I K. B. 4JO. - I (1) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 465 with the only proceedings which he, as plan. tiff, can control. The principle has been repeatedly acted upon.\" The injunction order in dispute is not based on any such principle. In fact, in the present case, it is the defendant of the previously instituted suit that has obtained the injunction order against the plain· tiff of the previously instituted suit. The considerations which would make a suit vexatious are. well explained in Hyman v. llelni ('). In that case, the defendant, in an action before the Chancery Division of the High Court brought an action against the plaintiffs in San Francisco. The plaintiffs, is an action in England, prayed to the Court to restrain the defendants from proceeding further with the action in San Francisco. It was contended that it was vexatious for the defendants to bring the action in San Francisco as the witnesses to the action wne residents of England, the con- troict between the parties was an English contract and that its fulfilment took place is England. Jn repelling the contention that the defendants' subse- quent action in San Francisco was vexatious, Brett, M. R., said at page 537 : \"If that makes an action vexatious it would be a ground for the interference of the Court, although there were no action in Eng· land at all, the ground for alleging the action in San Francisco to be vexatious being that it is brought in an inconvenient place. :But that is not the sort of vexation on which an English Court can act. It seems to me that where a party claims this interference of the Court to stop another action between the same parties, it lies upon him to shew to the Court that the multiplicity of actions is vexatious, and that the whole burden of proof lies upon him. He does not satisfy that burden of pr'.lof by merely she- (1 I L. R. [1883] 24 Ch. D. 531. l!Ml -Mano'\"'11al Choir• v. Rai BahaJur Rao Rqja Selh Hiralal Roghuhor Dayal J, 1961 M anoharlaJ Chopra v.

If two actions a.re broup;ht by t.hc same plaintiff against the same defen· dant in England for the same C<luse of action, then, a.R \"·as said iu J/Chonry v. Lewis (22 Cb. D. 397) a.nd the case of the Peruvian Guano Com'{Jllny v. Bodou·oldt (23 Ch. D. 225), prima faoie that is vexatious, and therefore the party who comphinR of such n multiplicity of actions had made out a prima facie ca:sc for the interference of the Court. Where there is an action by a. plaintiff in England, and a crossaction hy a deCendant in England, whe- ther the same prima facio case· of vaxation arises is a much more difficult point to decide and I am not prepared to say that it does.'' It should be noticed that this question for an action being vexatious was being considered with respect to the sub~cqucnt action brought by the defendant in the previously ins~ituted suit and when the restraint order was sought by the plaintiff of the earlier suit. In the case before UR, it is thC1 plaintiff of the subsequent suit who seeks to res. train the plaintiff of tho earlier suit from proceeding with his suit. Thia cannot be justified on general principles when tho previous suit has been instit,nted in a. competent Court. The reasons which weighed wit.h the Court helow for maintaining tho order of injunction may be given in its own wordR a.~ follows: \"In the plaint filed in the Asa.nsol Court the defendant has based his daim on the deed of dissolution dated 22, 1945, but ha.s avoided all references t.o tho proviHions regarding tho agreoment to place the disputeH bdoro the Indore Courts. It wa.s an action taken by the present dof<>ndant in anticipation of the present suit and was t.'\\ken in flagrant hl'each - I - --~' I (I) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 467 of the terms of the contract. In my opinion, the defendant's action constitutes misuse and abuse of the process of the Court.\" The appellant attached the deed of dissolution to the plaint he filed at Asansol. Of course, he did not state specifioq,lly in the plaint about tho proviso with respect to the forum for the decision of the dispute. Even if be h<td mentioned the term, that would have ma.de no difference to the Asansol Court entertaining the suit, ao it is not disputed in these proceedings that both the Inclore and Asa.nsol Courts could try tho suit in spite of the agreement. The appellant's institution of the suit at Asansol cannot be said to be in anticipation of the suit at Indore, which followed it by a few months. There is nothing on the record to indicate that the appellant knew, at tho time of his institu- ting the suit, that the respondent was cont('T.lpla- ting tho institution of a suit at Indore. The notices which the respondent gave to the appellant were in December 1945. The suit was filed at Asansol in August 1948, more than two years and a half after the exchange of correspondence referred to in the plaint filed at Asansol. In fact, it is the conduct -of the respondent in applying for the injunction in September 1953, knowing full well of the order .of the Calcutta High Court confirming the order refusing stay of the Asa.nsol suit and direct- ing that Court to proceed with the decision of tho issue of jurisdiction at an early date, which 0an be said to amount to an abuse of the process of the Court. It was really in the respondent's interest if he was sure of his ground that the i11sue of juris- diction be decided by the Asa.nsol Court expedi- tiously, as ordered by tho Calcutta High Court in May 1953. If the Asa.nsol Court had clearly no jurisdiction to try the suit in view of the terms of the deed of di8solution, the decision of that issue 19~1 Manoharlal Chopra v. Rai Bahadur Rao Raja Seth Hira/al Raghubar Dayal J, 1961 Manow/al ~r• v. Rai BaMdur Rao Raj• Stt.h Hiralal R4.ehuba1 Dayal J. 468 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1962] SUPP. would have finished the Asansol suit for ever. He, however, appears to have S.'ll'Oided S. deciRiOil of that iBBue from that Conrt and, insread of submit- ting to the order of the Calcutta High Court, put in this application for injunction. It is not under- standable why the appellant did not clearly state in his objection to the application what the High Court of Calcutta had ordered. That might have led the consideration of tho question by th<> Indore Court in a different perspective. It is not right to base an order of injunction, under s. 151 of the Code, restraining the plaintiff from proceeding with his suit at Asansol, on the consideration that the terms of the deed of dissolu- tion between the parties make it a valid con tract and the institution of the suit at Asansol is in breach of it. The question of jurisdiction of the Asansol Court over the subjeot matter of the snit before it will be decided by that Court. The Indore Court oannot docide that question. Further, it is not for the Indoro Court to see that the appellant observes the terms of the contract and does not file the suit in any other Court. It is only in proper proceedings when the Court considers alleged breach of contract and gives redress for it. For the purposes of the present appeal, we as~ume that the jurisdiction of the Asansol Court is not ou~ted by the provisions of the proviso in the deed of diSBolution, even though that proviso expresses the choice ')f the parties for having their rl.isputes decided in the Court at Indore. The appellant therefore could choose the forum in which to file his suit. He chose tho Court at Asansol, for his suit. The mere faot that Court is situate at a long distance from the place of residence of t.hc 1 es- pondent is not sufficient to e;tablish that the suit ha.s been filed iu that Court in order to put the res· pondent to trouble and ltarnssment fl.nd to unneceR- sary expense. - (1) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 469 It cannot be denied that it is for the Court to control the proceedings of the suit before it and not for a party, and that therefore, an injunction to a party with respect to his taking part in the proceedings of the suit would be putting that party in a very inconvenient position. It has been said that the Asansol Court would not act in a way which may put the appellant in a difficult position and will show a spirit of coopera· tion with the Indore Court. Orders of Court are net ordinarily based on such considerations when there be the least chance for the other Court not to . think in that way. The narration of facts will indi- cate how each Court ha~ been acting on its own view of the legal position and the conduct of the parties. There have been cases in the past, though few, in which the Court took no notice of such in- junction orders to the party in a suit before them. They are: Menon v. Parvathi Ammal(1), Harbhagat Kaur v. Kirpal Singh(') and Shiv Charan Lal v. Phool Chand ('). In the last case, the Agra Court issued an injunction against the plaintiff of a suit at lJelhi restraining him from proceeding with that suit. The Delhi Court, holding that the order of the Agra Court did not bind it, decided to proceed with the suit·. This action was supported by the High Court. Kapur J., observed at page 248: \"On the facts as have been proved it does appear rather extra-ordinary that a previous- ly instituted suit should be sought to be stay- ed by adopting this rather extraordinary procedure.\" It is admitted that the Indore Court could not have issued an injuction or direction to the Asansol Court not to proceed with the suit.

A court ought not to nchievo indirectly what it can- not do <lircctly. The plaintiff, who has been res· trained, is expected to bring the restraint order to the notice of the Court.. If that Court, as expected by the Indore Court, respects the injunction order ~gainst the appellant and does not proceed with the suit., the injunction order issued to the appel- lant who is th<> plaintiff in that suit is as effective an order for atT<'Fting the progreBB of that suit as an injun('tion order to tho Court would have been. If tht> Court insists on proceeding with the suit, the plaintiff will have cit.her to disobey the restraint order or will run the risk of bis suit being dismiseed for want of pro\"ecution. Either of these results is a consequence which 1111 order of the Court should not ordinarily lead to. The suit at Indore which had been instituted later, could be stayed in view of s. 10 of the Codo. The provisions of that section are clear, definite and mandatory. A Court in which a subsequent suit has been filed is prohibited from proceeding with the trial of that suit in certain specified cir- cumstances. When there is a special provision in tho Code of Civil Procedure for dealing with the contingcnciee of two such suits being instituted, re- course to the inherent powers under s. 151 is not justified. The provisions of s. 10 do not beoome inapplicable on a Court holding that the previously instituted suit is a vexatious suit or has been insti- tuted in violation of the terms of the contraot. It doos not appear correct to say, as has been said in Ram Bahadur v. Devidayal Ltd. ( 1 ) that the Legis- lature did not contemplate the provisions of s. 10 to apply when the previously instituted suit be held to be instituted in those circumstances. The pro- visions of s. 35A indicate t.hat the Legislature was aware of false or vexatious claims or defences (I) I. L. R. 195 I Bom. 334- • (1) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPOR'l'S 471 being made, in suits, and accordingly prm ided for compensatory costs. The Legislature could haYe therefore provided for the non-application of the provisions of s. 10 in those circumstances, but it did not. Further, s. 22 of the Code provides for the transfer of a suit to another Court when a suit which could be instituted in any one of two or more Courts is instituted in one of such Courts. In view of the provisions of this section, it was open to the respondent to apply for the transfer of the suit at Asansol to the Indore Court and, if the suit had been transferred to the Indore Court, the two suits could have been tried together. It is clear, therefore, that the Legislature had contemplated the contingency of two suits with respect to similar reliefs being instituted and of the institution of a suit in one Court when it could also be instituted in another Court and it be preferable, for certain reasons, that the suit be tried in that other Court. In view of the various considerations stated above, we are of opinion that the order under appeal cannot be sustained and cannot be said to be an order necellll8.ry in the interests of justice or to prevent the abuse of the proceBB of the Court. We therefore allow the appeal with costs, and set aside the order restraining the appellant from pro- ceeding with the suit at Asansol. SHAH, J.-I have perused the judgment deli- vered by Mr. Justice Daya.I. I agree with the conclusion that the appeal must succeed but I am unable to hold that civil courts generally have inherent jurisdiction in cases not covered by rr. 1 and 2 of 0. 39, Civil Procedure Code to issue temporary injunctions restraining parties to the proceedings before them from doing certain acts. The powers of courts, other than the Chartertd High Courts, in the exercise of their ordinary original Civil jurisdiction to issue temporary in- junctions are defined by the terms of s. 94( l )( c) and 1961 Manoharlal Chopra v.

The provisions relating to the issue of temporary injunctions arc to be found in 0. 39 rr. I and 2: a temporary injunction may be iBSUed only in those cases which come strictly within those rules, and normally the civil courts have no power to issue injunctions by transgressing the limits prescribed by the rules. It is true that the Higl) Courts constituted under Charters and (•xercising ordinary original jurisdiction do oxercise inherent jurisdiction to issue an injunction to restrain parties in a suit before them from proceedings with a suit in another court, but that is because the Chartered High Courts claim to have inherited this jurisdiction from the Supreme Courts of which they were succell8ors. This jurisdiction would he saved by s. 9 of the Charter Act (24 and 25 Viet. c. 10!) of 1861, and in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 it is expressly provided by s. 4. But tho power of the civil courts other than the Chartered High Courts must be found within s. 94 and 0. 39 rr. I and 2 of the Civil Procedure Code. Tho Code of Ci vii Procedure is undoubtedly not exhaustive: it does not lay down rules for guidance in re8pect of all situations nor docs it seek to provide rules for decision of all conceivable cases which may arise. The civil courts are authorised to pass such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice, or to prevent abuse of the process of court, but where an express provision is made to meet a. particular situation the Code must be observed, an departure therefrom ie not permissible. As observed in L. R. 62 I. A. 80 (Maqbul Ahmed v. Onkar Prata/,) \"It is impossible to hold that in a matter which is governed by an Act, which in some limited respects gives the court a statutory discn·tion, there can be implied in • - (1) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 473 court, outside the limits of the Act a general discretion to dispense with the provisions of the Act.'' Inherent jurisdiction of the court to make order ex debito justitiae is undoubtedly affirmed by s. 151 of the Code, but that jurisdiction cannot be exercised so as to nullify the provisions of the Code. Where the Code deals expressly with a particular matter, the provision should normally be regarded as exhaustive. Power to issue an injunction is restricted by s. 94 and 0. 39, and it is not open to the civil court which is not a Chartered High Court to exercise that power ignoring the restrictions imposed there- by, in purported exercise of its inherent jurisdic- tion. The decision of this Court in Padam Sen v. The State of Uttar Pradesh(') does not assist the case of the appellant. In Pa.dam Sen's case this Court was called upon in a criminia.l appeal to consider whether an order of a Munsiff appointing a commissioner for 1eizing certain account books of the plaintiff in a suit pending before th<i Munsiff was an order authorised by law. It was the case for the prosecution that the appellants offered a bribe to the commill!ioner as consideration for being allowed to tamper with entries therein, and thereby the appellants committed an offence pu- nishable under s. l65A of the Indian Penal Code. This Court held that the commissioner appointed by the civil court in exercise of powers under 0. 26 C. P. Code did not hold any office as a public servant and the appointment by the Munsiff being without jurisdiction, the commissioner could not be deemed to be a public servant. In dealing with the argument of counsel for the appellants that the civil court had inherent powers to appoint a com- missioner in exercise of authority under s. 151 Civil Procedure Code for purposes which do not fall (I) [IHI] I S.C.R. 884. 1961 M anoharlal Chopra v.

It is also well \\ recognized that tho inherent power is not to be exorcised in a manner which will be (1) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 475 contrary or differant from the procedure ex- pressly provided in the Code.\" The Court in that case held that in exercise of the powers under s. 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 the Court cannot issue a commission for seizing books of account of plaintiff-a purpose for which a commission is not authorized to be issued bys. 75. The principle of the case is destructive of the submission of the appellants. Section 75 empow- ers the Court to issue a commission for purposes specified therein: even though it is not so expressly stated that there is no power to appoint a commis- sioner for other purposes, a prohibition to that effect is, in the view of the Court in Padam Sen 's case, implicit in s. 75. By parity of reasoning, if the power to issue injunctions may be exercised, if it is so prescribed by rules in the Orders in Schedule I, it must he deemed to be not exercisable in any other manner or for purposes other than those set out in O. 39 rr. l and 2.
