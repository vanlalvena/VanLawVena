Civil Appeal No. 1536 (NCL} of 1970t, decided on December 4, 1975 Labour and Industrial Law - Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 - Section 2(1)(1) - \"Total disablement\" - MMning of A carpente1 fell down during the course of employment and suffered injuries resulting in the amputation of his left arm. Held: The mJury was of such a nature as to cause permanent disablement and it incapacitated him from performing all work which he was capable of ~rfonn~ ing, viz. that of a carpenter. (Para 5) Labour and Industrial Law - WOl'kmen's Compensation Act, 1923 Sections 4A(3) and 19 - Payment of compensation if becomes due only on settl~ment uncle~ Section 19-Penalty if on facts justified The respondent carpenter, a workman in the employment of the appellant fell down during the course of employment on July 6, 1968 and suffered injuries resulting in amputation of his left arm from the elbow causing total disablement. In response to the notice of the workman the appellant stated that he was a casual contractor and the injury was caused by his own negligence. Personal approach by the workman also did not help. No provisional payment was also made. The matter reached the commissioner who levied J?enalty to the extent of 50% and interest at 6% per annum. He ordered payment of Rs.15,092. The appellant filed a writ petition but failed. Hence the appeal by special leave. Held: It is wrong to contend that the compensation had not fallen due until it was 'settled' by the Commissioner under Section 19 by his impugned order dated May 6, 1969. The employer became liable to pay the compensation as soon rut the personal injury was caused to the workman by the accident which admittedly arose out of and in the course of employment. There was no suspension of the compensation pending settlement. It was the duty of the appellant, under Section 4A(l) of the Act, to pay the compensation at the rate provided by Section 4 as soon as the per&onal injury was caused to the respondent. (Paras 6, 7 and 8) So in the present facts and circumstances the Commissioner was in making an order for the payment of interest and the penalty.

Ltd. ~cccc® ION LINE;\" True Prinf\" 290 SUPREME COURT CASFS (1976) 1 sec No. 1, (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) was working as a carpenter for doing some ornamental work in a cinema hall of the appellant on July 6, 1968, when he fell down, and suffered injuries resulting in the amputation of his left arm from the elbow. He served a notice on the appellant dated August 11, 1968 demanding payment of compensation as his regular employee. The, appellant sent a reply dated August 21, 1968 stating that the respondent was a casual contractor, and that the accident had taken place solely because of his own negligence. The respondent then made a personal approach for obtaining the com- ~nsation, but to no avail. He therefore made an application to the Commissioner for Workman's Compensation, respondent No. 2, stating that he was a regular employee of the appellant, his wages were Rs.120 per mensem, he had suffered the injury in the course of his employment and was entitled to compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). Notice of the applica- tion was served on the appellant on October 10, 1968 calling upon him to show cause why penalty to the extent of 50 per cent and interest at 6 per cent per annum should not be imposed on him under Section 4A of the Act on the amount of compensation payable by him because of the default in making the payment of the compensation. The appellant contested the respondents' claim on the grounds mentioned above and on the further ground that respondent No. 2 had no jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate on the claim. He filed a memorandum of agreement on April 10, 1969 accepting the liability, to pay compensation for a sum which was found by the Commissioner to be so grossly inadequate that he refused to register it. 2. The Commissioner held in his order dated May 6, 1969 that the injury had resulted in the amputation of the left arm of the respondent above the elbow. He held further that the respondent was a carpenter by profession and \"by loss of his left hand above the elbow he has evidently been rendered unfit for the work of carpenter as the work of carpentry cannot be done by one hand only\". He therefore adjudged him to have lost \"100 per cent of his earning capacity\". On that basis, he calculated the amount of compensation at Rs. 9,800 and ordered the payment of penalty to the extent of 50 per cent, together with interest at 6 per cent per annum, making a total of Rs. 15,092. 3. The appellant felt aggrieved and filed a writ petition in the High Court of Orissa, but it was dismissed summarily on October 10, 1969. He has therefore come up in appeal to this Court by special leave. 4. It has not been disputed before us that the injury in question was caused to the respondent by an accident which arose out of and in the course of his employment with the appellant. It is also not in dispute that the injury resulted in amputation of his left ann at the elbow. It has however been argued that the injury did not result in per..nanent total disablement of the respondent, and that the Commissioner committed a gross error of law in taking that view as there was only partial disable- ment within the meaning of Section 2 ( 1) (g) of the Act which should have been deemed to have resulted in permanent partial disablement of ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

This argument has been advanced on the ground that the amputation was from 8\" from tip of acromion and less than 4½\" below tip of olecranon. As will appear, there is no force in this argument. S. The expression \"total disablement\" has been defined in Section 2( l) (/) of the Act as follows: (I) \"total disablement\" means such disablement whether of a temporary or permanent nature, as incapacitates workman for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident resulting in such disablement. It has not been di~puted before us that the. injury was of such a nature as to cause permanent disablement to the respondent, and the question for consideration is whether the disablement incapacitated the respondent for all work which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident. The Commissioner has examined the question and recorded his finding as follows: The injured workman in this case is carpenter by profession . . . . By loss of the left hand above the elbow, he has evidently been rendered unfit for the work of carpenter as the work of carpentry cannot be done by one hand only. This is obviously a reasonable and correct finding. Counsel for the appellant has not been able to assail it on any ground and it does not require to be corrected in this appeal. There is also no justification for the other argument which has been advanced with reference to Item 3 of Part II of Schedule I, because it was not the appellant's case before the Commissioner that amputation of the arm was from 8\" from tip of acromion to less than 41\" below the tip of olecranon. A new case cannot therefore be allowed to be set up- on facts which have not been admitted or established. 6. It has next been argued that the Commissioner committed a serious error of law in imposing a penalty on the appellant under Section 4A ( 3) of the Act as the compensation had not fallen due until it was 'settled' by the Commissioner under Section 19 by his impugned order dated May 6, 1969. There is however no force in this argument. 7. Section 3 of the Act deals with the employer's liability for com- pensation. Sub-section ( 1) of that section provides that the employer shall be liable to pay compensation if \"personal injury is caused to a workman by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment\". It was not the ca\"e of the employer that the right to compensation was taken away under sub-section ( 5) of Section 3 because of the institu- tion of a suit in a civil court for damages, in respect of the injury; against the employer or any other person. The employer therefore became liable to pay the compensation as soon as the aforesaid personal injury was camed to the workman by the accident which admittedly arose out of and in the course of the employment. Jt is therefore futile to contend that the compensation did not fall due until after the Commissioner's order dated May 6, 1969 under Section 19. What the section provides is that if any que .. tion arises in any proceeding under the Act as to the Uabihty of any person to pay compensation or as to the amount or duration of the compensation it shall, in default of agreement, be settled ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

There is therefore nothing to justify the argument that the employer's liability to pay compensation under Section 3, in respect of the injury, was suspended until after the settlement contemplated by Section 19. The appellant was thus liable to pay compensation as soon as the aforesaid personal injury was caused to the appellant, and there is no justification for the argument to the contrary. 8. It was the duty of the appellant, under Section 4A( 1) of the Act, to pay the compensation at the rate provided by Section 4 as soon as the personal injury was caused to the respondent. He failed to do so. What is worse, he did not even make a provisional payment under sub-section ( 2) of Section 4 for, as has been stated, he went to the extent of taking the false pleas that the respondent was a casual contractor and that the accident occurred solely because of his negligence. Then there is the further fact that he paid no heed to the respondent's personal approach for obtaining the compensation. It will be recalleo that the respondent was driven to the necessity of making an application to the Commissioner for settling the claim, and even . there the appellant raised a frivolous objection as to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and pre- vailed on the respondent to file a memorandum of agreement settling the claim for a sum which was so grossly inadequate that it was rejected by the Commissioner. In these facts and circumstances, we have no doubt that the Commissioner was fully justified in making an order for the payment of interest and the penalty. 9. The appeal fails and is dismissed.
