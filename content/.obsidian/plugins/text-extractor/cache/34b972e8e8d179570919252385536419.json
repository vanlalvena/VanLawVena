The petitioner was examined on June 3, 1971, June 16, 1971 and June 17., 1971. 3. According to the petitioner, the entire examination on the said dates related to the booking by the United Commercial Bank of the aforesaid forward exchange contract, dated June 4, 1966. On August 31, 1971, the petitioner was arrested under Section 19-B of the Exchange Act. Sub-section ( 1) of Section 19-B provides that \"if any officer of Enforce- ment ..................... has reason to believe that any penon in India or within the Indian Customs waters has been guilty of an offence punishable under the Exchange Act., he may arrest such penon and shall, as soon as may be, inform him of the grounds for such arrest,•. Sub-section (2) provides that uevery person arrested under sub-section (1) shall., without unnecessary delay., be taken to a Magistrate.,. Sub-section (3) empowered an officer of Enforcement arresting any person to release such person on bail or other- wise. In thil connection he has the same powers and is subject to the same provisions as the officer-in-charge of a police station. 4. The grounds of arrest served on the petitioner are elaborate. These give detailed reasons why the enforcement officer had reasons to believe that the petitioner had ~n guilty of an o.ffence under Section 4(2) and under Section 22 of the Exchange Act punishable under Section 23 thereof. We may reproduce Paras 31 to 40 of the grounds of arrest : \"31.

The question arises, with which we will presently deal with, whether after these grounds have been s~rved on the petitioner. it could be said that he was a penon accused of on offence within Article 20(3) of the Coniatltution. 6. The petitioner was prortuced before the Chief Preaidency Magis- trate,- Calcutta, on August 31, 1971, who released him on bail of R1. 10,000/-, with the direction that the petitioner should contact the Investigating Officer every alternate day during the next two WP.eks and thereafter as and when called for. 7. On September 6, 1!)71, the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Calculta, recorded: ''Both accused are on C. B. and present. Perused report sub- mitted by I.

In the course of this enquiry the petitioner learnt that a case had been registered on a First Information Report, dated November 8, 1971, recorded under Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code and an order, dated November 25, 1971, had been obtained from the Chief Presidency Magis- trate, Calcutta, permitting the investigation to be made under Sec- tion 155(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This First Information Report deals with the forward exchange contract purported to have been entered onJune 4, 1966, by M/s. Hindusthan Motors Ltd. and the United Commercial Bank Ltd. The offences alleged in the First Information Report are Section 120-B, read with Section 420, I. P. C., and under Section 4(2), read with Section 23(l}(b) of the Exchange Act, and the names and addresses of the accused are given as the Management and other officers of the United Commercial Bank and the Management and officers of the Hindusthan Motors Ltd. 12. On April 17, 1972, another summons was issued to the petitioner under Section 19-F of the Exchange Act to appear before the Deputy Director, Enforcement Directorate, on April 28, 1972, to give evidence relating to the transaction of exchange contract booked from Hindusthan Motors Ltd. on June 4, 1966. The petitioner wrote to the Deputy Director submitting that the summons was violative of Article 20(3) of the Constitution. In this connection he submitted as follows: u1 remind you that after examining on June 3, 1971, June 16, 1971, and June 17, 1971, proceedings have been initiated and I was arrested on August 31, 197 l, and in the grounds of arrest one of the grounds of accusation mentioned is the transaction referred to by you in the summons . '' The petitioner requested the Deputy Director to withdraw the summons. 13. On April 22, 1972, the Deputy Director informed the petitioner that the contentions had no substance at all. He further informed the petitioner that the summons issued on April 17, 1972, could not be withdrawn and requested the petitioner to comply with the same. 14. The petitioner thereupon filed the present petition on April 27, 1972. 15. The learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. A. K. Sen, contends that on the facts given above the petitioner fell within the description of a \"person accused of an offence\" within the meaning of Article 20(3). He contended that after the Enforcement Officer had examined the peti- tioner and put his conclusions in the grounds of arrest, the petitioner was definitely accused of an offence under the Exchange Act. He next contends that, at any rate, the petitioner was accused of an offence when the First Information Report was recorded under Section 154, Or. P. C., by ShriJ. N. Prabhakar, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Central Bureau of Investig- ation, Special Police Investigation Unit, New Delhi. 16.

Slate of West Bengal. 1 He strongly relies on the following passages at p. 479; ''It was strenuously urged that under Section 104 of the Customs Act, 1962, the Customs Officer may arrest a person only if he has reason to believe that any person in India or within the Indian Customs waters has been guilty of an offence punishable under Sec- tion 135 and not otherwise and he is bound to inform such person of the ground.a of his arrest. Arrest of the person who is guilty of the offence punishable under Section 135 and information to be given to him amount, it was contended, to a formal accusation of an offence and in any case the person who has been arrested and who have been informed of the nature of the infraction committed by him stands in the character of an accused person. We are unable to agree with that contention. Section 104(1) only prescribes the conditions in which the power of arrest may be exercised. The officer must have reason to believe that a person has been guilty of an offence punishable under Section 135, otherwise he cannot arrest such person. But by informing such person of the grounds of his arrest the Customs Officer does not formally accuse him with the commission of an offence. Arrest and detention are only for the purpose of holding effectively an inquiry under Sections 107 and 108 of the Act with a view to adjudging confiscation of dutiable or prohibited goods and imposing penalties. At that stage there is no question of the offender against the Customs Act being charged before a Magistrate. Ordinarily after adjudging penalty and confiscation of goods or without doing so, if the Customs Officer forms an opinion that the offender should be prosecuted he may prefer a complaint in the manner provided under Section 137 with the sanction of the Collector of Customs and until a complaint is so filed the person against whom an inquiry is commenced under the Customs Act does not stand in the character of a person accused of an offence under Section 135. 17. The learned counsel for the petitioner, however, contends that the icts here are different. He says that under the Exchange Act the position slightly different. He further says that in Romesh Mehta's case (supra), no :iquiry had been made while in the present case an enquiry under Sec- on 19-F had been made and the Deputy Director had come to a definite mclusion that the petitioner was guilty of an offence. He further says that 1e next step would be an enquiry under Section 23 of the Exchange Act hich might result in a penalty under Section 23(l)(a) or the case being :nt to a Court for trial. He say1 that as far as the enquiry under Sec- on 23(l)(a) is concerned, it is an enquiry in respect of an offence and no 1rther charge or complaint necessary before undertaking the enquiry. He contends that the protection under Article 20(3) extends not only to ·iminal trials, but also to trials of all offences under the Exchange Act :!Cause for the same offence one person may be convicted and penalty levied oder Section 23(l)(a) or convicted by a Court and sentenced to nprisonment. 18. These aspects have not been considered by this Court in any case hich has been brought to:our notice, but we do not think that it is necessary , dispose of these contentions because we are of the opinion that the second >int raised by Mr. A. K. Sen must prevail.

It is well settled that with the lodging of a first information report a person is accused of an offence ,-.ithin the meaning of Article 20(3). In M. P. Sharma v. Satisl, Chandra,• where aearch warrants were isaued against persons who had been included in the category of accused in the fint information report, Jagannadhadu, J • ., oblerved at p. 1088: \"Nor is there any reason to think that the protection in respect of the evidence so procured ii confined to what transpires at the trial in the court room. The phrase used in Article 20(3) ii rrto be a witness', and not to \"appear as a witnea\": It followa that the protection afforded to an accused insofar as it ii related to the phrue ''to be a witnets\" is not merely in respect of testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from him. It is availab]e therefore to a person against whom a formal ac~uaation relating to the commission of an offence has been levelled which in the normal course may result in prosecution. Whether it is available to other persons in other situations does not call for deeision in this case.,. 20. In Raja Nar41anlal Ban.silal v. Man,ck Phiroi:. Mistry, 1 it was observed: \"Similarly, for invoking the constitutional right against tes\\bnonial compulsion guaranteed under Article 20(3) it must appear that a formal accusation has been made against the party pleading the guarantee and that it relates to the commiaion of an offence whfoh in the normal course may result in prosecution.'' 21. In Romuh Cluutdra M,lala v. StaJI of Wu, Bmgal (supra}, Shah, J., after reviewing a number of authorities., observed at p. 472: \"Normally a person 1tands in the character of an accused when a Fint Information Report is lodged agaimt him in respect of an offence before an officer competent to investigate it, or when a complaint ia made relating to the- commiaion of an offence before a Magistrate competent to tr)l or send to another Magistrate for trial r,f the offence.'' 22. The Additional Solicitor General says that the petitioner had not been 1pecifically named as accused in the First Information Report and, therefore., he is not entitled to the protection under Article 20(3). We are unable to agree with him in this respect. The petitioner wu the General Manager of the United Commercial Bank and it was alleged in the ground.a of arrest that · the petitioner was in charge of, or was responsible. to the United Commercial Bank Ltd. for the conduct of the business of the said Bank, and that he failed to prove in coune of hi■ statements made under Section 19-F before Shri D. K. Guha, Deputy Director of Enforcement that the contravention took place without hu knowledge or that be exerci■ed all due diligence to prevent the afor-■aid contravention., as required under Section 23-C of the Exchange Act. 2S. In view of these allegations it ii idle to contend that the petitioner wu not included in the expreuion \"tho management and other officen of the United Commercial Bank Ltd.\".

Although we hold that the petitioner is a person accused of an offence within the meaning of Article 20(3), the only protection that Article 20(3) gives to him is that he cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself. But this does not mean that he need not give information regarding matters which do not tend to incriminate him. This Court observed in State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghad, • as follows : \"'In order that a testimony by an accused person may be said to have been self-incriminatory the compulsion of which comes within the prohibition of the constitutional provision, it must be of such a character that by itself it should have the tendency of incriminating the accused, if not also of actually doing so. In other words, it should be a state- ment which makes the case against the accused person at least probable, considered by itself.'' 25. Therefore we are unable to set aside the summons. The petitioner must appear before the Deputy Director and answer such questions as do not tend to incriminate him, as explained by this Court. 26. The petition is accordingly allowed to t'h.e extent that it is declared that the petitioner is a person accused of an offence within Article 20(3). 27. The facts in Writ Petition No. 165 of 1972 are similar and the same declaration is given. 1. 2. ( 1973) 1 Supreme Court Ca•e• 702 (From Gujarat High Court) [BEFORE A. Al.AOJRISWAMI, I. D. DUA AND C.
