These 10 terrorists entered Mumbai at a strategic location (i.e. Badhwar Park, a fishing village in the heart of city), where they would not be suspected and from where they could easily move to their target locations for mass killing of Indians and foreigners on Indian soil. The maps on the basis of which their operation was planned and executed had allegedly been prepared by TA-2 and TA-3 (who had been caught by Indian police much prior to the alleged attack). The 10 terrorists equipped d with sophisticated gadgets and armed with highly lethal weapons and ammunitions divided themselves into 5 pairs. In their whole operation, the ten terrorists killed a total of 166 persons, injured 238 others and destroyed property estimated at Rs 150 crores. TA-1 (who had paired with DA-1) was caught alive but the rest of his 9 associates who had come to India died in the encounter. From the confession of TA-1 and other evidence, everything became clear and e the prosecution could know about the Pakistani identity of TA-1 and could also prepare a list of 35 wanted accused (WA-1 to WA-35). TA-1 confessed before the Magistrate with the purpose of becoming a hero and setting an example for others to follow his footsteps and become a fidayeen (martyr) like him. Because the Pakistani authorities disowned him and did not accede to his demands of providing him with a Pakistani lawyer to defend him, he started his confession by giving details about his Pakistani family, relations, f friends, their addresses, phone numbers and his life in Pakistan. Then he described how he once heard the speeches made by various members of LeT, and being motivated searched for their office and finally reached there to be inducted as its member. Thereafter he gave a detailed and sequential description of the training he received in the LeT camps i.e. (a) Daura-e-Sufa (physical training and lessons in Hadis), (b) Daura-e-Amma (physical exercises, running and g climbing over mountains), (c) Khidmad (preparing food, keeping watch over trainees and looking after Mujahids), (d) Daura-e-Khassa (a two-and-a-half months training in which they were finally turned into Jihadis), (e) Daura-e-Ribat (intelligence training), and (j) mmine training for 3 days (training about reading and using maps, using GPS for marine ways, sailing, casting fishing net, etc.).

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 5 trained in the use of weapons and the arduous tasks like climbing mountains for 60 hours without food, etc. TA-I confessed that they had every opportunity to leave the camp and no pressure was exerted on them to become a fidayeen. However, TA-1 proudly, bravely and boldly wanted to become a fidayeen and strike terror in his enemies (i.e. Indian people). Therefore, he and 9 others were chosen to attack various places at Mumbai (which is the financial capital of India). TA-1 confessed that he committed the first murder on the hijacked Indian fishing boat, Kuber, where TA-1 himself slit the throat of the navigator by asking the others to hold the legs of the victim. As per the prosecution story TA-1 and DA-1 killed a total number of 72 persons starting with the said navigator and ending at Vinoli Chowpaty, in Mumbai (where they were finally caught). As per prosecution evidence, others i.e. DA-2 to DA-9 killed 94 persons and injured 108 others at various places like Leopold Cafe, Mazgaon Blast, Hotel Taj, Nariman House and Hotel Oberoi by taking positions there. TA-1 in his statement gave details of how he and DA-1 moved from one place to another killing and injuring people and destroying property. On their way to CST (the main railway station in Mumbai) they had planted an RDX bomb beneath the taxi driver's seat (the prosecution found that this taxi exploded at Vile Parle and killed the driver and a passenger). TA-1 further confessed that after the CST carnage, they went to Cama Hospital killing everyone who came their way. Then they entered Cama Hospital and injured and killed civilians and police there. (As per evidence led by the prosecution, luckily the patients of the Cama Hospital were safely taken to locked interiors to which the terrorists had no access). TA-1 then confessed that by killing and injuring policemen they were able to escape out of Cama Hospital. Thereafter the duo killed policemen in a police vehicle (a Qualis) and took it. However as its tyre was destroyed by gunshots, they hijacked another car (a Skoda) and were moving towards their next target when they were caught at Vinoli Chowpaty where police had put up a strong barricade to stop them. This confession of the appellant was corroborated by other evidence. Some of the major charges against TA-1 were: conspiracy to wage war against the Government of India; collecting arms with the intention of waging war against the Government of India; waging and abetting the waging of war against the Government of India; commission of te1Torist acts; criminal conspiracy to commit murder; criminal conspiracy, common intention and abetment to commit murder; committing murder of a number of persons; attempt to murder with common intention; criminal conspiracy and abetment; abduction for murder; robbery/dacoity with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt; and causing explosions punishable under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. TA-1 was found guilty of all these charges besides many others and was awarded the death sentence on five counts, life sentence on five other counts, as well as a number of relatively lighter sentences of imprisonment for the other offences. The High Court confirmed the death sentence of TA-1. However TA-2 and TA-3 were acquitted. Thus presents appeals were filed by TA-1 and also by the State.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 6 Held: SUPREME COURT CASES (2012) 9 sec [Ed.: At least a part of the detailed narration of the findings of fact recorded by the Supreme Court is necessary to appreciate the sheer guile, cold-blooded ferocity and clear intention and wilfulness with which TA-1 and DA-1 (and of the other terrorists and of their collaborators stage managing the Attack from inside Pakistan) went about killing innocent Indians. TA-1 seems to stand out for his tenacity in wanting to kill as many Indians as possible. Out of the total of 166 persons killed and 238 injured by the ten terrorists, TA-1, personally and jointly with DA-1, was directly responsible for killing at least 72 people and causing injuries of various kinds to 130 people.] The inflatable rubber dinghy in which the 10 terrorists [the appellant , Kasab (TA- I or tried Accused 1) and DA- I to DA-9 ( deceased-Accused I to 9)] came to Mumbai landed at a place called Badhwar Park (the fishermen's colony, where many boats usually land and chance of suspicion was less). The dinghy's arrival at that particular place could not possibly be by accident or by chance. Badhwar Park was evidently selected as the landing site for the terrorists with great care and with consideration of its immense strategic potential for the attack on their chosen targets (which were located within about I km from there and from where taxis were readily available). It is also clear that the selection of Badhwar Park as their landing place was not made by the attackers themselves but by someone else among the conspirators. The selection of the landing place for the dinghy was clearly based on a good deal of reconnaissance and survey work; and whoever selected the spot for landing had undoubtedly made himself fully familiar not only with the Mumbai shoreline but also the city. (Paras 96 and 97) The difference in the height of TA- I and DA- I appears to have struck almost anyone who saw them together. Although different witnesses described them by their complexion (both DA- I and TA- I are desc1ibed as fair), age (DA- I is said to be between 22 and 25 years and TA- I between 22 and 24 years), built of body (DA- I as medium built, TA- I as strongly built), their apparel and the bags they were carrying, almost everyone referred to their heights, calling DA- I as \"the taller\" and TA-I as \"the shorter\" one. Many witnesses called them \"lamboo\" (tall) and \"butka\" or \"tingu\" (short). (Para 102) In regard to the CST Railway Station episode, like all other parts of the case , the prosecution has gathered a very large amount of evidence: ocular , forensic and of other kinds e.g. CCTV recordings. They have documented practically every action and movement of the two killers from the point when DA- I threw the first hand-grenade at the passengers on the platform till they went out of CST through the foot-overbridge on the side of Platform No. I of the local lines (and thereafter). On the basis of the ocular evidence alone (not taking into account for the moment the other evidence) the prosecution has presented before the court a vivid and photographic (figuratively and actually) account of the CST events. (Para 101) PW 49, a police officer on duty (who got injured at CST from the bullets of TA- I and DA-1) stated that he saw the two terrorists indiscriminately firing from AK-47 rifles at the passengers sitting in the main hall. He intimated the railway police helpline and the Commissioner of Police about the assault by the terrorists. His statement was recorded at the hospital and on that basis a formal FIR was drawn up in regard to the CST episode. He identified his statement (Ext. 219) and the formal FIR (Ext. 220). He identified the photograph and dead body of DA-1. He identified TA-1 both in court and in test identification parade.

(Paras 103 to 113) Perched in his office, PW 65, a railway announcer had a completely unobstructed view of what the terrorists were doing through the glass screen of his cabin. Showing great devotion to duty and remarkable presence of mind, PW 65 saved countless people from death or injury by constantly announcing on the public address system and guiding passengers to safe places. When TA-1 and DA-1 came near he and his colleagues crouched on the floor of their cabin to avoid being shot at. Nonetheless , shots were fired in the direction of their cabin and one of the bullets smashed the glass pane and went right through, piercing the plywood partition at the back of the cabin. They continued crouching on the floor for about an hour-and-a-half. All the while they were in contact with their officers on the telephone. PW 65 identified TA-1 and DA-1 from his photo identity card. He was shown a black haversack, Article 219. He identified it as the bag that TA-1 had thrown away in the main hall of the local railway lines. (Paras 114 to 118) The witnesses PW 61 and PW 102 are professional photographers working with the Times of India group. Both of them, caring little for their own safety and displaying exemplary professionalism, followed the killers practically at their heels. Their ocular testimony together with the photographs taken by them provides a graphic picture of the carnage at CST. PW 61 identified TA-1 in the dock as the shorter of the two gunmen. He identified the photographs which showed a book-stall owner felled by a bullet, a policeman in uniform and a plain clothes man taking aim with the rifle at TA-1 with the other gunman DA-1 and persons/passengers lying dead or injured. He also heard the public announcements made by PW 65. PW 102 stated that he saw the two gunmen going from Platform No. 1 to the foot-overbridge. Both of them were firing and lobbing hand-grenades. He took about three to four (3-4) photographs of TA-1 and DA-1. He identified TA-1 as \"the shorter fellow\". He also identified TA-1 's partner from the photograph in the identity card of DA-1, Article 61. (Paras 119 to 132) PW s 54 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 62 , 63 and 66 are policemen or members of the Railway Protection Force. At the time of occurrence , they were on duty at different places in the vast premises of CST. On hearing the explosion and the gunshots and on seeing the passengers fleeing for their lives , they realised that a terrorist attack was unde1way at the railway station and proceeded from their respective stations towards the spot where the assault was launched. On the way , some of them came across each other. A few were lucky to escape unharmed and some survived even after receiving grave injuries to tell the story before the court; some others laid down their lives while trying to tackle the assailants either completely unarmed or carrying antiquated weapons that failed them at the most crucial moment. PWs 59 , 58, 62, 66, 63 and 60 identified TA-1 and the DA-1. (Paras 134 to 14 7) PW s 50, 51, 52, 53, 86, 87 and 88 are some of the passenger witnesses. They were in the main hall of the main railway lines of CST waiting for their respective trains. They were jolted out of whatever they might be doing or thinking at that moment by the explosion of the first grenade thrown by DA-1 and from that moment they watched , in abject horror, as TA-1 and his companion firing indiscriminately at the group of passengers in the main hall; DA-1 throwing the second grenade and then the two moving around on the platforms in ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(Paras 148 to 156) TA-1 and DA-1 were seen exiting CST via the foot-overbridge and coming a down the bridge in the evidence of PW 102 and in the photograph of TA-1 (Ext. 410-D) taken by PW 102. The entry to Cama Hospital is from Mahapalika Road on its western side, and Badruddin Tayabji Marg runs along the back of its premises. The prosecution, with the aid of eleven ( 11) eyewitnesses, has traced practically every step taken by TA-1 and DA-1 from the moment they came out of CST Railway Station, entered Cama Hospital and eventually left the hospital. Examining only some of the steps gives a broad idea of how the two were b moving around killing people, completely mindlessly. (Para 157) [Ed.: The killing spree of TA-1 and DA-1 in Cama Hospital is recounted in paras 158 to 184. The killing spree of TA-1 and DA-1 after they exited Cama Hospital until the final encounter with the police at Vinoli Chowpaty, is recounted in paras 185 to 211.] TA-1 and DA-1 were able to have a free run for over 3 hours , killing c innocent people and policemen at will. However, finally DA-1 was killed in their last encounter with a police team, but TA-1 was taken alive in custody. PW s 1, 2 and other policemen had put up barricades at Vinoli Chowpaty towards which TA-1 and DA-1 were moving in the Skoda car which they had earlier hijacked. In a bid to escape, the driver tried to take a U-tum just before the barricades. However, the car could not climb over the road divider; it dashed against it and d stopped. PW 1 and 6 other policemen rushed towards the car and surrounded it. The driver and the other person who was sitting on the front left seat raised their hands pretending surrender but when PW 1 approached the driver he started firing at him through the lowered window. PW 1 fired back from his service revolver. At that time PW 1 was about ten to twelve feet from the driver of the car. PW 1 told the court that he shot the driver of the Skoda car (DA-1) and injured him. The other occupant of the Skoda car (TA-1 ), who was sitting on the e front left seat, opened the door on his side and got out of the car. While getting out , he deliberately fell on the road. PW 2 and ASI Tukaram Ombale (killed) were proceeding towards the car's front left door. The person who had got out of the car from the front left door started firing at Tukaram Ombale with an AK-47 rifle. Even as he was being fired at, Tukaram Ombale threw himself bodily upon his assailant (TA-1). Tukaram Ombale and PW 2 were injured by shots from the f AK-47 rifle. Other policemen started hitting the assailant with lathis. They succeeded in disarming him. His AK-47 rifle was snatched away from him by policemen and TA-1 was taken into custody. (Paras 219 to 223) PW 1 identified the FIR, his signatures on all its pages. In court, PW 1 identified TA-1. He also said that he had identified TA-1 in the test identification parade . He had also identified the dead body of DA-1 . The depositions of other policemen who were present at Vinoli Chowpaty (viz. PW 2 and PW 3) was g similar to that of PW 1. (Paras 220 to 248) Now Article 12, the AK-47 rifle which was identified by PWs 1 to 3 as having been recovered from the leg space below the d1iver's seat of the Skoda car actually belonged to the slain police officer Kamte. DA-1 evidently picked it up while switching from the Qualis to the Skoda, leaving his own AK-4 7 rifle in the damaged Qualis.

He identified Article 12, the AK-47 rifle from the number on its butt (94) and the body (LY8860) on the basis of the entry (Ext. 76) made in the register maintained in the armoury. The empty magazine with it also bore the same number. On the other hand the AK-47 rifle along with a magazine (labelled Articles 427 and 428 respectively) that was recovered from the damaged Qualis police vehicle under seizure panchnama (Ext. 529) belonged to DA-1 and he had carried it with him from Pakistan. This becomes clear from the ballistic analysis of the bullets recovered from dead bodies which shows that one A , who was killed at CST and Police Officer Kamte, who was killed in the Qualis police vehicle were hit by bullets fired from the AK-47 rifle , Article 427. This is also in confmmity with what TA-1 stated in his confession before the Magistrate that as they left the Qualis police vehicle, DA-1 left behind his AK-47, the magazines of which had emptied by then and picked up the AK-47 of one of the officers lying dead in the vehicle. (Paras 250 to 252) The taxi (in which TA-1 and DA-1 went to CST Railway Station and had planted a bomb therein) was blown up by the bomb on western express highway, Vile Parle (East) , near Swan City Club at slightly after 10.45 p.m. on 26-11-2008. The explosion destroyed the vehicle and instantly killed its two occupants (the driver and a passenger). As brought out from telephonic records , the evidence of PW 168 (sister-in-law of the passenger) and PW 169 (friend of taxi driver) , the only fault of the taxi driver was that he was hired by the two messengers of death to carry them from Badhwar Park to CST and of the passenger was that on that chaotic night in Mumbai, when death seemed to be lurking around every comer, he had thought that a taxi would be a safer mode of transport than the local trains. (Paras 253 to 259) Facts that emerge are that after landing at Badhwar Park, TA-I and DA-1, went to CST by a taxi. At the railway station they killed as many people as they could and then left via the foot-overbridge to Badruddin Tayabji Marg. They overcame any efforts by the police to stop them on the sixth floor of the Cama Hospital building, at the main front gate of the hospital and on Badruddin Tayabji Marg near Rang Bhavan Lane. In the process, they killed, among many others, three (3) senior police officers and grabbed the Qualis in which policemen were trying to intercept the two terrorists. They were unable to go very far in the Qualis as one of its wheels was destroyed in the gunfire. They then commandeered another vehicle, a Skoda, from its occupants at gun-point. They were driving the Skoda on Marine Drive when they were finally caught at Vinoli Chowpaty . The road on which they were travelling goes to Malabar Hill and their car was headed in that direction . In his statement before the Magistrate, TA-1 had said that as they sat in the Skoda after seizing it from its occupants he had asked DA-1 where they had to go. DA-1 said they had to go to Malabar Hill. TA-1 further asked where exactly in Malabar Hill, but DA-1 said that he would tell him on reaching Malabar Hill. There is no other evidence that their destination was actually Malabar Hill. It is also not clear as to where exactly they intended to go once they reached Malabar Hill or who was/were their target(s) there. But it is worth remembering that the Governor and the Chief Minister of Maharashtra as well as the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court all reside on Malabar Hill. It is quite possible that the two desperados had anyone amongst them as their next target.

The above account is based only on part of the ocular evidence led by the prosecution before the trial court. Besides the depositions referred to above, the prosecution a has an enormous volume of other evidence such as: articles recovered and seized from places through which the two terrorists passed, and the places where they stopped; the vehicles they used until they were finally caught; medical and forensic reports, CCTV recordings, phone call records, station diary entries, police logs, etc. Reference to all that evidence is not necessary since on the basis of the ocular evidence discussed above alone, there remains no doubt that TA- I, personally and jointly with DA-1 is directly responsible for killing at least 72 b people and causing injuries of various kinds to 130 people. (Para 160) All the witnesses whose testimony is being relied on had a life and death encounter with TA- I and his associate, DA-1 at close quarters. The physical appearance of the two terrorists was etched on their minds. All the witnesses gave a detailed description of the two terrorists to the court. They described them by their complexion, age, body-built and height, stating that one of them was tall c and the other was short. All of them identified TA- I in court as the shorter of the two assailants. They also identified DA-1 from his corpse and DA-1 's photograph on the fake identity card, Article 61. They also stated before the court that they had identified TA- I in the test identification parades held. Their testimony is found acceptable without any hesitation. (Paras 161 and 494) From the forensic evidence it is clear that of 72 people who died at the hands d of TA- I and DA-1 , at least 6 persons fell to shots fired by TA- I. Thus there is no difficulty whatsoever in holding TA-I guilty of multiple murder, murder with common intention and abetment, attempt to murder with common intention and abetment , abducting in order to murder, robbery with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt, and several other allied offences under the Penal Code; committing terrorist acts punishable under Section 16 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act , 1967 , as well as offences under the Explosives Act, 1884 , e Explosive Substances Act , 1908 , and Arms Act , 1959.

It is based on the underlying assumption that tl1e five pairs were not connected to each other by a common conspiracy and that they were not acting in furtherance of a conspiracy tlrnt was keeping them bound together even after they had separated physically in order to execute their assigned roles under the conspiracy. There is no basis for such an assumption, even in light of the prosecution evidence. Further , it would be wrong to proceed on such an assumption even without taking into account the evidence of conspiracy that the prosecution has to present with reference to the other aspects of the case and the other venues of the terrorist attack.

(Paras 265 and 266) For an idea of the fire power the terrorists were carrying to wreak havoc, the seizure panchnamas from the venues of violence may be examined. It is worth noting that once the terrorists had taken position at their respective targets of attack it did not prove easy to neutralise them or to take them out. Maharashtra Police was quite unequal to the task and, consequently, MARCOS (Naval) Commandos were called in at Hotel Taj. Finally, the whole operation at all the three places, Hotel Taj, Hotel Oberoi and Nariman House, was handed over to the National Security Guards who were able to clear the sites but not before the terrorists gave them stiff resistance. The prosecution has documented the episodes at Leopold Cafe, Hotel Taj, Hotel Oberoi, and Nariman House, as well as the Mazgaon taxi blast as exhaustively as it has documented the incidents at CST, \"Cama in\", \"Cama out\", \"Skoda robbery\" and \"Vinoli Chowpaty\" relating to TA-1 and his dead companion DA-1. (Paras 290 to 293 and 65 to 70) The landing site for the terrorists at B adhwar Park was selected with great care. The selection of the targets for attack was made with even greater care. CST is a place where people would be present in large numbers, completely defenceless and helpless, within a relatively small and confined space. TA-1 and DA-1 went to CST for killing in large numbers and, according to plan, they were able to kill 52 and wound 109 people. The intention was plainly to shock and create terror. From CST , TA-1 and DA-1 were headed for Malabar Hill , presumably with the intent to take captive some very important person there (viz. the Governor, Chief Justice and Chief Minister all residing on Malabar Hill), which would put enormous pressure on the Government of Maharashtra and the Central Government. Of the other two teams, one went to Leopold Cafe and then to the Taj Hotel, and the other to the Oberoi Hotel. Leopold Cafe is a highly popular eating and drinking establishment, frequented not only by Mumbaikars but also by domestic and international tourists in large numbers. The Cafe is open to the pavement, and it is known as a place where one can sit at leisure over a cup of coffee or a glass of beer, and watch bustling Mumbai pass by on the pavement and road just outside. The attack on Leopold's was meant to kill in large numbers, including foreign tourists. Hotel Taj is an iconic hotel, part of the history of Mumbai. Hotel Oberoi is a modern, super-luxury hotel. These are places where the upper crust of the country rubs shoulders with its colleagues and peers from across the globe. The attack at those two hotels and at Leopold Cafe had a dual purpose. First, the killing of wealthy and powerful Indians and foreigners would not only send shock waves across this country but would also attract international attention, which is the greatest prize and inducement for any terrorist group. Secondly, the terrorists hoped to take some \"very important people\" as hostages there, as this would, they believed, enable them to negotiate with the Indian authorities regarding some highly vague and fantastic demands. The attack at Nariman House was intended to somehow involve Israel in the matter and to further internationalise the issue by killing the Jewish and Israeli citizens living there. For a short while, the terrorists who had taken possession of Nariman House seemed to be succeeding in their objective as they were able to establish contact with someone called Levi in US, who appears to have rushed in as a self-styled intermediary, negotiating to save the lives of the people taken hostage by the terrorists.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 15 Thus seen, the attacks at all five targets appear to be integrally connected with each other and TA-1 and DA-1 are as much part of the offences committed at the other places as they are responsible for the offences committed by them directly. It may even be said that even if TA-1 was apprehended without firing a single shot and without personally committing any offence on the soil of India, he would still have been connected through conspiracy to the offences committed by the other four teams of terrorists in whose company he came to Mumbai. Thus, it cannot be said that TA-1 and his dead accomplice, DA-1, were acting separately and that their actions were not connected in any manner with the offences committed at the other places by the other 8 terrorists with whom they jointly made the sea journey to Mumbai's shore. It is obvious that all 5 teams were bound together and each team was acting in execution of a common conspiracy. (Paras 304 and 298) The identity of TA-1 and DA-1 first came to light when TA-1 made his statement before police at hospital disclosing his name, age and address and those of his accomplice. The statement made by TA-1 led to the recovery of the Indian wooden boat (Kuber, which they had hijacked to reach Mumbai) on the sea and then to the recovery of the dead body of the navigator of Kuber, mobile devices and a notebook. \"The abandoned boat\" was a registered Indian fishing boat belonging to one Heeralal Masani of Porbandar. TA-1 identified the wooden boat as \"the Indian boat\" in which he, along with his nine associates, had approached the Mumbai shore and on which he had killed the \"Nakhva\" of the boat, whose body he had kept in the engine room. TA-1 then led the police team and the panchas to the engine room and showed them the dead body of a male that was kept in the corner near the ladder. The body's hands were tied at his back and the body was kept in a supine position. TA-1 then proceeded to take out a satellite phone, a GPS and a notebook that were kept concealed under a wooden plank in the engine room on the left side of the dead body. He took out these three articles and handed them to the police team. The articles that were taken out and produced by TA-1 from the engine room of the Kuber and were seized under the panchnama (Ext. 138). (Paras 306 to 315) Another seizure panchnama, Ext. 182, contains a much longer list of articles , some of which are not expected to be found on a fishing boat of Indian origin. (]) 6 inches steel spanner with writings thereon in Urdu , and spanners having pictures of a gun, as well as a big knife with a 4 inch wooden hilt. (2) Empty packets of 50 bullets for 30 bore pistol, made in China. (3) Nylon rope meant for unloading goods from the big ship to the small one, having a round knot on one side. (4) Pieces of silver foil used to consume drugs. (5) One match-box with the mark \"Hockey\" of Fazal Sons Match Industries, Pakistan. ( 6) 1 white plastic container with a red lid inscribed with the words \"National Food\", and with its contents listed in both English and Urdu. (7) 1 khaki-coloured paper cover with writing in Urdu. PW 43 (who looked after the fishing family business to which Kuber belonged) on being shown the satellite phone, GPS and the other articles recovered from Kuber and seized under the two panchnamas (Exts. 138 and 182), told the court that those articles did not belong to him nor were those articles on board when the boat had sailed out to sea from Porbandar on 14-11-2008. Ext. 138, is a thin notebook. It contained guard duty roster for the 10 terrorists, list of articles, gadgets, weapons, ea tables, contact numbers and list of code words.

(Para 323) a The stains of sweat, saliva and other bodily secretions on a number of blankets , shawls and many other items of clothing recovered from Kuber subjected to DNA profiling showed that except DAs 2, 5 , 7 and 9 the rest of the six accused were connected with said articles.

The same day , the dinghy and the articles found in it were seized by police in the presence of two panch witnesses. The Yamaha outboard m achine (OBM) that was fitted to the rubber dinghy is of special significance for the case. PW 30 who was a Marine Engineer stated before the court that his company was the sole authorised importer of OBMs in India and that the OBM in the recovered dinghy was not sold by their company.

(Paras 334 to 336) Something as ordinary as a piece of foam, a pink-coloured piece of foam inseparably connects TA-1 to the other eight terrorists . The pink foam ran like a thread through all the episodes and connecting them as integral pieces of one single , horrible drama. The foam was u sed to provide padding and cushion to the IEDs and the hand-grenades kept in the bags so as to prevent them from exploding accidentally while the terrorists were carrying them on their person. The foam pieces recovered from the Kuber and found in the bags that were picked up from CST , the terrace of the Cama Hospital building and the two bags containing unexploded IEDs found near Hotel Taj and seized under the panchnama, Ext. 736, were sent for chemical examination at the Forensic Science Laboratory. PW 247, the forensic expert deposed before the court that all the foam pieces tallied with each other in respect of hue (appearance) and physico-thermal characteristics.

He concluded that the source of all the foam pieces was the same. He identified his report before the court, marked as Ext. 1013.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 17 gone to Hotel Taj, Hotel Oberoi and Nariman House and were holed up there , even taking hostages for some time. From their respective positions they were in regular contact with their collaborators and were constantly receiving moral support, tactical advice and guidance from them by means of mobile phones. The phone calls made by the terrorists from Hotel Taj, N ariman House and Hotel Oberoi came to be noticed and were intercepted by a watchful member of the Anti-Terrorist Squad. CDs recording conversations from the three different mobile numbers and the transcripts of conversations made from those CDs were accurate except for a very few minor errors . PW 242 told tl1e court that all the calls from the above three mobile phones were made to a single number, 012012531824 , which later investigation revealed to be the number of a private corporation based in New Jersey , USA, with the domain name Callphonex. (Paras 350 to 360) From the evidence of PW 156 (owner of Callphonex) it does not require much imagination to see that \"Kharak Singh\", claiming to be from India , was a fake identity created for the sole purpose of obtaining the VoIP services from Callphonex for the said number 012012531824. But this was made very clear by the investigation made by FBI as would appear from a communication dated 18-2-2009 , from tl1e Special Agent of FBI (PW 153) to the court of Magistrate. As per the FBI Agent the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which Kharak Singh's email account was operated were located in Pakistan & Kuwait and proxy locations in USA and Russia. It is noted above that among the documents furnished by PW 156 to FBI there were three chat logs between a representative of Callphonex and Kharak Singh and the emails between Kharak Singh and Callphonex. Even in the three chat logs it is not the same person who is chatting under tl1e fictitious name of Kharak Singh. That the persons chatting as Kharak Singh are different persons is evident from the different styles of language and their use of slang. Perhaps the commercial interest of PW 156 got the better of his sense of discretion, or perhaps he was too nai:ve to see through the clear deception. His services were thus used by a bunch of terrorists for the mass killing of innocent people. According to him , he realised that a false account was opened with him for unlawful purposes only after the massacre in Mumbai. (Paras 366 to 371) The collaborators of the terrorists killing innocent people in India hid behind the phone number of Callphonex and tried to conceal the locations from which they were making calls. The terrorists holed up in at Hotel Taj, Hotel Oberoi and N ariman House were calling or receiving calls from their collaborators from three mobile numbers 9910719424, 9820704561 and 9819464530 . The terrorists at Hotel Taj were using a sim card that was obtained in India under a fictitious name Suresh Prasad on the basis of fake identity documents. The terrorists at N ariman House and Hotel Oberoi used sim cards snatched from their respective victims, which they used to make calls from their own mobile phones. From the materials brought on record, it is evident that all the five Nokia 1200 mobile phones recovered from Hotel Oberoi were manufactured in DongGuan, China, and were shipped to Pakistan. (Paras 372 to 377) The attack on Mumbai killing and wounding scores of innocent people was a wicked act, and the conversations between the terrorists and their collaborators while the attack was underway appear to be its ugliest and most hateful part. Those conversations unveil warped minds conceiving perverted objectives and trying to realise those objectives through vicious and dastardly means.

They constantly urge the terrorist to start the fire but he seems to be a little nervous as he finds himself alone holding a hostage (Ramamoortl1y) while his other partners, who had gone on reconnaissance and in search of more hostages, are delayed in returning. Every time the collaborators ask him to start the fire and throw grenades he complains that his partners have not come back even though he had told them to come back quickly. The collaborators based in Pakistan ask him many questions about the sea journey and got answers that would not have made them very happy as everything did not go as per plan. The terrorist in Hotel Taj told them that the Indian boat was not sunk in the sea but was left afloat. What is more, DA-1 's satellite phone and a GPS device too were left in the boat. The only information that seems to have pleased the collaborators based in Pakistan was that the navigator of the Indian boat was killed by cutting his neck. [But on that score also the happiness was not complete because his body was not thrown into the sea but left on the boat itself.] In the midst of getting all this information the collaborators kept pressing the terrorist to set the Hotel on fire but this man appeared unequal to the task. (Para 381) In another conversation between the terrorists at N ariman House and the collaborators based in Pakistan, N, one of the hostages, a Mexican citizen, is brought to the phone and is threatened by the collaborators that if she wanted to remain alive she must do their bidding and talk to the Indian authorities as dictated by them. The poor woman agreed to do all that they demanded and yet she was killed at the end without the slightest qualms. The recording of the intercepted conversation extends over twelve-and-a-half (12.5) hours. And it was exactly on these lines that the terrorists from Nariman House talked to India TV as the transcripts of those interviews would indicate. (Paras 382 and 385) The deception and the falsehood that the terrorists were Indian Muslims coming from Hyderabad and were connected with some fictitious organisation called Mujaheddin, Hyderabad Deccan, is one of the most ominous and distressing parts of the conspiracy. The deception was ominous because it was aimed at destabilising Indian society and its Governments. But it was equally distressing for being so deeply untruthful. Indian Muslims may have a long list of grievances against tl1e establishment. Some of the grievances may be fanciful, some may be of their own making and some may be substantive. Nevertheless, no Indian Muslim would even think of venting his grievance like an animal, killing, maiming and wounding innocent people: his own countrymen. This is because he is not only loyal to his faith and community but equally loves his country and fellow countrymen. If TA-1 had not been caught alive and the investigating agencies had not been able to unravel the conspiracy fully and in all its devious ways, the terrorists might have passed themselves off as Indian Muslims and that would have led to devastating short-term and equally debilitating long-term consequences. It would have caused a cleavage of distrust and suspicion between communities in India and disturbed the communal peace and harmony of the country. It is not impossible that conflagrations would have erupted in different parts of the country which the Governments would have found difficult to contain.

Thus, as news of the carnage spread across the country through the media, travellers would start arriving in different parts of the country, some having lost their near and dear ones at CST, some with a wounded companion and others shell-shocked by the experience of a terrorist attack on the railway station. Their first-hand eyewitness accounts of the carnage added to reports in the print media and visuals in the electronic media could be highly inflammable and could have easily evoked communal violence that would have been difficult to contain. (Para 387) In view of the enormous amount of evidence of all possible kinds it is clear that the terrorist attack on Mumbai was in pursuance of a larger conspiracy of which TA-1 was as much part as the nine dead accused and the other wanted accused. It will be futile even to suggest that TA-1 while he was shooting innocent people wantonly at CST and at the other places along with DA-1 had no connection with the attacks taking place at the other targets by the other eight (8) members of the terrorist group. From the evidence on record it is further clear that the conspiracy did not stop with the group of 10 te1Torists leaving the Pakistani shores. It continued developing and growing even while the larger conspiracy was under execution. In the course of execution of the larger conspiracy by the ten terrorists in Mumbai, the ten terrorists were being advised and guided to meet the contingencies arising at those three different places. In other words, newer conspiracies were being hatched even in the course of execution of the larger conspiracy and the conspiracies came to an end only when all the remaining eight terrorists were killed at the three places where they were holed up.

From the judgment in Miranda case it further appears that the police would subject the suspect to incommunicado inten-ogation in a tenibly oppressive atmosphere. The inten-ogator would employ all the intimidation tactics and inten-ogations skills at his command, not to find out the truth but to somehow crack the suspect and make him \"confess\" to his guilt. It was in such a situation that the US Supreme Court evolved the Miranda rules, in order to provide necessary protection to the accused against self-incrimination and to ensure the voluntary nature of any statement made before the police. However, the right to silence and the right to the presence of an attorney granted by the Miranda decision to an accused as a measure of protection against self-incrimination have no application under the Indian system of law. (Paras 439 and 440) The protection to the accused against any self-incrimination guaranteed by the Constitution is very strongly built into the Indian statutory framework and there is absolutely no reason to draw any help from the Miranda principles for providing protection against self-incrimination to the accused. A bare reference to the provisions of CrPC would show that Sections 161 to 164 CrPC read with Sections 25, 26 and 32 Evidence Act are designed to afford complete protection to the accused against self-incrimination.

The obligation to provide legal aid to the accused as soon as he is brought before the Magistrate is very much part of our criminal law procedure, but for reasons very different from the Miranda rule aimed at protecting the accused against self-incrimination. And to say that any failure to provide legal aid to the accused at the beginning, or before his confession is recorded under Section 164 CrPC, would inevitably render the trial illegal is stretching the point to unacceptable extremes. The law of POTA is a major departure from the common criminal law process in this country. One can almost call POTA and a few other Acts of its ilk as exceptions to the general rule. Now, in the severe framework of POTA, certain constitutional safeguards are built into Section 32, and to some extent in Section 52, of POTA. But the mainstream criminal law procedure in India, which is governed by CrPC and the Evidence Act, 1872 has a fundamentally different and far more liberal framework, in which the rights of the individual are protected in a better and more effective manner in different ways. It is, therefore, wrong to argue that what is said in context of POTA should also apply to the mainstream criminal law procedure. (Paras 453 to 455) Nandini Satpathy v. P.L.

Illinois, 12 L Ed 2d 977 : 378 US 478 (1964), cited It was erroneously submitted that providing a lawyer at the stage of trial would provide only incomplete protection to the accused because, in case the accused had already made a confession under Section 164 CrPC , the lawyer would be faced with afait accompli and would be defending the accused with his hands tied. (Para 456) The object of the criminal law process is to find out the truth and not to shield the accused from the consequences of his wrongdoing. A defence lawyer has to conduct the trial on the basis of the materials lawfully collected in the course of investigation. The test to judge the constitutional and legal acceptability of a confession recorded under Section 164 CrPC is not whether the accused would have made the statement had he been sufficiently scared by the lawyer regarding the consequences of the confession. The true test is whether or not the confession is voluntary. If a doubt is created regarding the voluntariness of the confession, notwithstanding the safeguards stipulated in Section 164 it has to be trashed; but if a confession is established as voluntary it must be taken into account, not only constitutionally and legally but also morally. (Para 457) The right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution does not exclude any voluntary statements made in exercise of free will and volition. The right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution is fully incorporated in the provisions of CrPC (Sections 161, 162, 163 and 164) and the Evidence Act, 1872, as manifestations of enforceable due process, and thus compliance with these statutory provisions is also equal compliance with the constitutional guarantees.

Article 39-A came to be inserted in the Constitution by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 3-1-1977 as part of the \"Directive Principles of the State Policy\". In furtherance to the ideal of Article 39-A, Parliament enacted the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, that came into force from 9-11-1995. All this development clearly indicates the direction in which the law relating to access to lawyers/legal aid has developed and continues to develop. It is now rather late in the day to contend that Article 22(1) of the Constitution is merely an enabling provision and that the right to be defended by a legal practitioner comes into force only on the commencement of trial as provided under Section 304 CrPC. The provisions of CrPC and the Evidence Act fully incorporate the constitutional guarantees, and the statutory framework for the criminal process in India affords the fullest protection to personal liberty and dignity of an individual. However, there is a great hiatus between what the law stipulates and the realities on the ground in the enforcement of the law. The abuses of the provisions of CrPC are perhaps the most subversive of the right to life and personal liberty, the most precious right under the Constitution, and the human rights of an individual. Access to a lawyer is, therefore, imperative to ensure compliance with statutory provisions, which are of high standards in themselves and which, if duly complied with, will leave no room for any violation of constitutional provisions or human rights abuses. Article 39-A emphasises that free legal aid was an unalienable element of a \"reasonable, fair and just\" procedure, for without it a person suffering from economic or other disabilities would be deprived from securing justice. The right to free legal aid is an essential ingredient of due process, which is implicit in the guarantee of Article 21 of the Constitution. The reasons for the need of the accused to access a lawyer is due to the indigence and illiteracy of the vast majority of Indians accused of crimes.

He would need a lawyer when the charge-sheet is submitted and the Magistrate applies his mind to the charge-sheet with a view to determine the future course of proceedings. He would need a lawyer at the stage of framing of charges against him and he would , of course, need a lawyer to defend him in trial. To deal with one terrorist, the said rights given to the indigent and underprivileged people of this country by the Supreme Court 31 years ago cannot be taken away. (Paras 461 to 473) Hussainara Khatoon (4) v. State of Bihar, (1980) 1 SCC 98 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 40; Khatri (2) V. State of Bihar, (1981) 1 sec 627 : 1981 sec (Cri) 228; State of WB. V.

State of Bihar, (1980) 1 SCC 81 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 23, cited Therefore, the right to access to legal aid, to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner, arises when a person arrested in connection with a cognizable offence is first produced before a Magistrate. It is the duty and obligation of the Magistrate before whom a person accused of committing a cognizable offence is first produced to make him fully aware that it is his right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner and, in case he has no means to engage a lawyer of his choice, that one would be provided to him from legal aid at the expense of the State. The right flows from Articles 21 and 22(1) of the Constitution and needs to be strictly enforced. All the Magistrates in the country are directed to faithfully discharge the aforesaid duty and obligation. It is further made clear that any failure to fully discharge the duty would amount to dereliction in duty and would make the Magistrate concerned liable to departmental proceedings. (Para 474) It needs to be clarified here that the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner is not to be construed as sanctioning or pe1mitting the presence of a lawyer during police interrogation. According to our system of law, the role of a lawyer is mainly focused on court proceedings. The accused would need a lawyer to resist remand to police or judicial custody and for granting of bail; to clearly explain to him the legal consequences in case he intended to make a confessional statement in terms of Section 164 CrPC; to represent him when the court examines the charge-sheet submitted by the police and decides upon the future course of proceedings and at the stage of the framing of charges; and beyond that, of course, for the trial. It is thus to be seen that the right to access to a lawyer in this country is not based on the Miranda principles as protection against self-incrimination, for which there are more than adequate safeguards in Indian laws. The right to access to a lawyer is for very Indian reasons: it flows from the provisions of the Constitution and the statutes, and is only intended to ensure that those provisions are faithfully adhered to in practice. (Para 475) Every accused unrepresented by a lawyer has to be provided a lawyer at the commencement of the trial, engaged to represent him during the entire course of the trial. Even if the accused does not ask for a lawyer or he remains silent, it is the constitutional duty of the court to provide him with a lawyer before commencing tl1e trial. Unless the accused voluntarily makes an informed decision and tells the court, in clear and unambiguous words, that he does not want the assistance of any lawyer and would rather defend himself personally, the obligation to provide him with a lawyer at the commencement of the trial is absolute, and failure to do so would vitiate the trial and the resultant conviction and sentence, if any, given to the accused.

It may have other consequences like making the delinquent Magistrate liable to disciplinary proceedings, or giving the accused a right to claim compensation against the State for failing to provide him legal aid. But it would not vitiate the trial unless it is shown that failure to provide legal assistance at the pre-trial stage had resulted in some material prejudice to the accused in the course of the trial.

What is important for the present, however, is the note in \"the Record of Formalities .... \" that TA-I refused the offer of legal aid made to him. On 29-12-2008, the Magistrate took the rather unusual step of directly forwarding TA-1 's letter to the \"Hon'ble Ambassador, Pakistan\", with a covering letter under his seal and signature. Unfortunately for TA-I, the country of his nationality was in a mode of complete denial at that stage, and there does not seem to be even an acknowledgment of his letters requesting a Pakistani lawyer. On 17-2-2009, TA-I was produced before the Magistrate for recording his confession under Section 164 CrPC. On 25-2-2009, a charge-sheet was submitted in the case , and on 23-3-2009, TA-I was produced before tl1e Sessions Court through electronic video linkage for the first time. He then made a request to be given a lawyer at the expense of the State. On 30-3-2009, the court appointed W to represent TA-1. But when it came to light that W was representing a victim of the terrorist attack of which TA-I was accused and a potential witness in the trial for compensation for the victim in a separate civil proceeding, the trial Judge revoked the appointment of W by a reasoned order passed on 15-4-2009, observing that there was a possibility of conflict of interests. Then, after careful consideration and consultations with a number of Senior Advocates, the court finally chose K, advocate, to represent TA-I. (Paras 479 and 481) On 17-4-2009, the confession of TA-I recorded by the Judicial Magistrate was opened before the court and copies were given to the Special Public Prosecutor and K, counsel for TA-I.

On the same day, the prosecution opened its case. It is another matter that, towards the end of the trial, K picked repeated quarrels with the court. From the orders passed by the court in that regard, it is clear that K was bent upon delaying the trial proceedings and was raising groundless objections at every step, trying to make it impossible for the court to proceed with the trial. As a result, the court was eventually forced to remove K from the trial. K challenged the court's order removing him from the trial before the High Court, but the High Court affirmed the order of the trial court. It may be noted here that even counsel for TA-I in the Supreme Court did not find any fault with the decision of the court to remove K from the court proceedings. From that stage, TA-1 was represented by P, who seems to have handled the case as well as anyone could have done in face of the evidence against TA- I. (Para 482) TA-I's refusal to accept the services of an Indian lawyer and his demand for a lawyer from his country cannot be anything but his own independent decision. The demand for a Pakistani lawyer in those circumstances, and especially when Pakistan was denying that TA-1 was even a Pakistani citizen, might have been impractical, even foolish, but the man certainly did not need any advice from an Indian court or authority as to his rights under the Indian Constitution. He was acting quite independently and, in his mind, he was a \"patriotic\" Pakistani at war with this country. On 23-3-2009, TA-1 finally asked for a lawyer, apparently convinced by then that no help would come from Pakistan or anywhere else. He was then immediately provided with a set of two lawyers. In the aforesaid facts we are firmly of the view that there is no question of any violation of any of the rights of TA-1 under the Indian Constitution. He was offered the services of a lawyer at the time of his arrest and at all relevant stages in the proceedings. The absence of a lawyer at the pre-trial stage was not only as per the wishes of TA-I himself, but that this absence also did not cause him any prejudice in the trial. (Paras 485 to 487) Kwas appointed to represent TA-I on I6-4-2009 and he made an application for time on 2I-4-2009. The court allowed him 8 days' time, which cannot be said to be unreasonable. It is true that during those 8 days some very brief hearings were held on 2-3 days on the issue of the juvenility of TA-I. But that does not mean that the counsel for TA- I was not given sufficient time to prepare for the case. A chart was given showing not only the day-to-day developments in the trial but also giving details of the hours of the court proceedings on each day, and from this chmt it is cleat· that K was allowed ample time for prepm·ation. It would be pertinent to note here that K himself never complained about not being given sufficient time. From the record of proceedings of the trial court, K does not appem· to be the non-complaining type, one who would suffer silently or take things lying down. In the later stages of the trial, K raised all kinds of objections and left no opportunity to noisily protest against the procedural decisions of the trial court, yet he never complained that he was given insufficient time for preparation. In the course of the trial, when K requested for adjournment for cross-examination of some important witnesses, the court accommodated him on most occasions. Thus it cannot be accepted that the defence was not allowed sufficient time for preparation of the case and that denial of sufficient time vitiated the trial.

The Magistrate proceeded to take his statement very slowly and with great circumspection. First she completely insulated TA-1 from the police. She explained to him that from that point he was in her custody and not in the custody of the police. She asked him whether he was ill-treated or abused by the police in any manner and why he wanted to make the confessional statement. To her first question TA-1 replied in the negative, and as for the reasons for him making a confession he said he would explain everything when his statement was recorded in detail. The Magistrate further satisfied herself that the appellant was willing to make the confessional statement voluntarily and not under any pressure, coercion or allurement by the police or anyone else. Nonetheless, she did not take his statement on that day but told him that she wanted him to reflect further on the matter, for which purpose she gave him 24 hours' time. She then remanded him to judicial custody where he was not accessible to the police or any other agency. When TA-1 was brought back to her on 18-2-2009 at 11 a.m., she had another long exchange with him. She confirmed once again that TA-1 wished to make the statement of his own volition and not under any influence. She asked for which offence he wanted to make confession. He replied that on 26-11-2008, he and his accomplices made a fidayeen attack on Mumbai city and he wanted to make a confession about the attack and the conspiracy behind it. She asked when he had felt like making a confession. He told her that the thought of making the confession came to him when he was arrested by the police. He added that he had absolutely no regret for whatever he had done. He wanted to make the confession to set an example for others to become fidayeen like him and follow him in his deeds. The Magistrate cautioned him by saying that he should make the statement only if he wished to do so. She further cautioned him by saying that any confessional statement made by him would be taken down in writing and it would be used as evidence against him and that might lead to his conviction. TA-1 said he was aware of the consequences. Even after this lengthy and detailed interaction, the Magistrate did not take his confession on that day but gave him a period of 48 hours for further reflection, telling him that during that period he would not be in police custody but would be kept in jail in her custody. She advised him to reconsider the matter with a composed mind. She then remanded him to judicial custody with the direction that he be produced before her on 20-2-2009, at 11 a.m. TA-1 was produced before the Magistrate as directed, on 20-2-2009 at 10.40 a.m. The Magistrate repeated the entire gamut of explanations and cautions at the end of which the appellant said that he still wanted to make his confession.

After recording his statement , she also gave such certificates as required under Section 164( 4) CrPC. (Paras 9 to 14 and 37 to 95) a The main body of the confessional statement, is in the form of a statement made by TA-I with only minimal interjections by the Magistrate. She occasionally asked TA-I to clarify the meaning of some uncommon words or code words used in the conspiracy. TA- I's statement, made before the Magistrate over two days is long and rambling, at points repetitive and full of seemingly superfluous details that would appear quite unnecessary if one is to take a limited view of the case and judge the culpability of the appellant only on the basis of b the events in Mumbai. To that end, it would be quite simple and convenient to give a brief summary of TA- I's confessional statement. But such an approach will not do justice to the case and therefore, the full statement of TA- I, unabridged and unadorned has been scanned in the instant case. (Para 15) Having read TA-1 's statement for a number of times, it is impossible to hold that the confession is not voluntary and is liable to be thrown out for that reason. A little reflection would show this. The references to TA-2 and TA-3 at three (3) places in the confessional statement is highly unsatisfactory. The reference to their destination being Malabar Hills when DA-1 and TA-I were caught at Vinoli Chowpaty is equally vague, and that also is perhaps mentioned to establish a connection with the alleged maps prepared by TA-2 and TA-3. But so far as the rest of the very detailed confession is concerned , there is absolutely no reason to doubt that it was made voluntarily and without any influence or duress from any external agency. (Para 506) The detailed references by TA-I to his parents and a large number of his relatives , their addresses and the mobile phone numbers of some of them, and his references to the different places in Pakistan is TA-1 's assertion, made consciously or subconsciously, of his Pakistani identity and nationality. Shortly after his arrest , TA-I had sent two letters both addressed to the Pakistani High Commission asking for a Pakistani lawyer. Those two letters were not even acknowledged and, for all intents and purposes, he was disowned by the country to which he belongs. Thus, in the statement that he made before the Magistrate on 20-2-2009 , TA-I was making it clear that he was a Pakistani by birth and by citizenship , and was making assertions that no one could deny. (Para 507) It needs to be kept in mind that TA- I was making the statement after being in police custody for several months. Under relentless police interrogations, he would have recalled the smallest details of his past life, specially relating to the preparation and training for the attack on Mumbai . (The statements made before the police were not, however , admissible in evidence as being barred by the various provisions of CrPC and the Evidence Act). But when TA-I went to the Magistrate to make his confession, everything would be completely fresh in his mind. He would also have unconsciously picked up those words pointed out by counsel for TA-I and these would have become part of his own vocabulary. Therefore , uttering words like \"sahzish\" or \"POK\" is not surprising. (Para 508) As to his knowing the names of many people in Lashkar-e-Toiba, their respective positions in the hierarchy and their roles in the organisation, again there is nothing unusual about it. TA- I was not a mercenary hired for the operation. He was a highly committed and devoted member of the organisation and, therefore, there is nothing strange or wrong in his coming to know many C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Further, it is to be kept in mind that his being caught alive was not part of the plan of the handlers. According to the plan, he, like the other nine terrorists in the team, was supposed to die in the course of the attack. As to the recording of certain statements within quotes by the Magistrate, that is only a manner of how TA-1 spoke. If the confessional statement confirms the findings of the investigation that should go to the credit of the investigation, and it cannot be said that the confessional statement was recorded to confirm the police investigation. (Para 509) The production of the accused before the Magistrate on 17-2-2009, even though he had expressed his willingness to make the confessional statement in early December 2008, is legitimate and understandable. The police could not afford to lose custody of TA-1 at that stage, as it was essential in connection with their investigation, which was still incomplete to a very large extent at that time. Once TA-1 was produced for recording of the confession under Section 164 CrPC , the law ordained the Magistrate to send him to judicial custody and not back on police remand. In those circumstances , the police was fully justified in producing TA-1 for confession only after completing its own investigation , when it no longer needed TA-1 in its custody. (Para 510) Before the Magistrate TA-1 stated that the thought of making the confession came to him when he was arrested by the police . He then added that he had absolutely no regret for whatever he had done. At another stage in the proceedings, the Magistrate once again asked why he wished to make the confessional statement, to which he replied that he wanted to set an example for others to follow and to become fidayeen like him. It is thus clear that he was not making a confessional statement from any position of weakness or resignation, or out of remorse. He was a hero in his own eyes, and in those circumstances it is not possible to hold that the confession was not voluntary. It may further be noted that, though the counsel for TA-1 questioned the voluntariness of the confession, he did not say that the statements made therein were untrue in any manner. (Para 511) In the course of trial, after 58 prosecution witnesses had been examined and the next witness was about to enter the witness box on 20-7-2009, TA-1 in the dock expressed a desire to have a word with his counsel, K. After a brief consultation that lasted for about half a minute, K informed the court that TA-1 wanted to say something to the court directly. On being asked to speak by the court, TA-1 said that he was accepting his guilt. The Special Public Prosecutor objected to entertaining any plea of guilty at that stage, on the grounds that the stage of Section 229 CrPC was already over. The court, however, rightly overruling the objection , allowed TA-1 to make a statement, which was recorded after giving him due caution. (Para 512) The second confession by TA-1 is once again a long statement but it does not have the alleged organised structure found in the first confessional statement. What is of importance is that, though structurally and sequentially the statement made in the court is completely different from the confessional statement made before the Magistrate, it has broadly the same contents. It is true that in the confessional statement he presents himself as the central figure in almost all the episodes while in the statement before the court he appears to be perceptibly retreating to the background. The lead role in and the overt acts are attributed to others rather than to himself.

The killing of the navigator on the boat Kuber that he owned up to almost with pride before the Magistrate is now assigned to DA-9 with TA-I not even present in the engine room. Significantly, however, as regards his joining of Lashkar-e-Toiba, the formation of the conspiracy , the preparation and training for the attack on Mumbai, as well as the identities of the men in the organisation , there is hardly any omission in TA-1 's statement made in the court. Further, in the statement to the comt, though there is mention of the hand- prepared maps, there is no mention of their source. There is no reference to TA-2 and TA-3 as the maker and the deliverer (respectively) of those maps. In TA-I's statement before the court there is no reference at all to his family but the reason for this is not far to seek. His Pakistani identity and nationality having been acknowledged there was no need for TA-I to remind the Pakistani establishment of his nationality by giving details of his family and their addresses. The court, of course , did not accept the statement that was sought to be made as the plea of guilty because it was a very diluted and partial admission of only some of the charges. It, accordingly, proceeded with the trial. (Paras 513 to 517) While dealing with the statements made by TA-I, it may also be noted that, finally, in the statement recorded under Section 313 CrPC, he denied the entire prosecution case and also retracted his two previous statements. It is evident that by the time the statement under Section 313 CrPC was recorded towards the end of December 2009, the Jihadi sheen had worn off and the desire to live was again exe1ting its pull on TA- I. The submission of TA- I's counsel cannot be accepted to eschew TA-1 's confessional statement made before the Magistrate completely from consideration. Thus the confessional statement recorded by the Magistrate is voluntary and truthful, except insofar as it relates to the other two accused, TA-2 and TA-3. (Paras 518 and519) ZF.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 33 Held: The evidence of conspiracy in present case may be broadly classified under three heads: (i) the confessional statement by TA-1; (ii) the objective findings in the vessel Kuber, the inflatable mbber dinghy, the different places of attack by the other groups of terrorists and the locations of bomb explosion in the two taxis; and (iii) the transcripts of the phone conversations between the terrorists and their collaborators and handlers from across the border. Evidence under any of these three heads is sufficient to bring home the charges relating to conspiracy against TA-1. (Para 522) Allegedly the intercepted conversations transc1ibed in the transc1ipts concerned began after TA-1 had been taken into police custody. It was therefore contended that with the arrest of TA-1, his link with the other alleged conspirators was snapped, and it could no longer be said that he continued to be a part of the conspiracy and that in that situation the conversation among the alleged co-conspirators cannot be used against TA-1. (Para 523) But in the present case the phase of planning the attack and training for it which form the core of the conspiracy , took place in Pakistan and the terrorists including TA-1 came to Mumbai in execution of the main objects of the conspiracy. TA-I was apprehended while he was on a killing spree in execution of the objects of the conspiracy and the transcripts of the phone conversation of the other terrorists, associates of TA-I and their foreign collaborators, relate to a time when the speakers were not only free but were actively involved in trying to fulfil the objects of the conspiracy. The transcripts are by no means any confessional statements made under arrest and they are fully covered by the provisions of Section I O of the Evidence Act. There is no reason not to take them into consideration in support of the charge of conspiracy against TA- I. (Para 525) State v.

In addition, he has been separately convicted under Section 121-A IPC for conspiracy to commit offences punishable by Section 121 and Section 122 IPC for collecting arms, etc. with intention of waging war against the Government of India, and has been given life sentences under these two sections. (Para 526) In its nmrower sense, \"Government of India\" is only the executive limb of the State. It comprises a group of people, the administrative bureaucracy that controls the executive functions and powers of the State at a given time. Different Governments , in continuous succession , serve the State and provide the means through which the executive power of the State is employed. The expression \"Government of India\" is surely not used in this narrow and restricted sense in Section 121 IPC. The expression \"Government of India\" is used in Section 121 IPC to imply the Indian State, the juristic embodiment of the sovereignty of the country that derives its legitimacy from the collective will and consent of its people. The use of the phrase \"Government of India\" to signify the notion of sovereignty is consistent with the principles of Public International Law, wherein sovereignty of a territorial unit is deemed to vest in the People of the territory and exercised by a representative Government. (Para 537) Mohd. Arif v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2011) 13 sec 621 : (2012) 2 sec (Cri) 766, referred to Earlier the word used in Section 121 (as well as all the other sections referred to above) was \"Queen\". After the formation of the Republic under the Constitution it was substituted by the expression \"Government of India\" by the Adaption of Laws Order of 1950. In a Republic, sovereignty vests in the People of the country and the lawfully elected Government is simply the representative and a manifestation of the sovereign , that is , the People. Thus , the expression \"Government of India \", as appea1ing in Section 121 , must be held to mean the State or interchangeably the People of the country as the repository of the sovereignty of India which is manifested and expressed through the elected Government.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 35 [Ed.: It is really mystifying why the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950 did not simply substitute \"Queen\" with \"Republic of India\".] The expression, \"in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy\" referred to in the Report of the Law Commission that examined the draft Penal Code in 1847 is very significant to understand the nature of the violent acts that would amount to waging war. In \"waging war\", the intent of the foreign enemy is not only to disturb public peace or law and order or to kill many people. A foreign enemy strikes at the sovereignty of the State, and his conspiracy and actions are motivated by that animus. (Para 540) State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu, (2005) 11 SCC 600 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1715, followed Law Commission Report that examined draft Penal Code in 1847; A History of the Criminal Law of England, Vol. 3 at p. 242, referred to It was wrongly submitted that if an offence comes within the definition of \"terrorist act\" under Section 15 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, it would automatically fall out of Section 121 IPC. It was also an extreme submission that the incorporation of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, should be viewed as deemed repeal of Section 121 IPC. As explained in Navjot Sandhu, (2005) 11 SCC 600, a \"terrorist act\" and an act of \"waging war against the Government of India\" may have some overlapping features, but a terrorist act may not always be an act of waging war against the Government of India, and vice versa. The provisions of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and those of Chapter VI of the Penal Code, including Section 121, basically cover different areas. (Para 542) State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu, (2005) 11 sec 600 : 2005 sec (Cri) 1715, followed The primary and the first offence that TA-1 and his co-conspirators committed was the offence of waging war against the Government of India. It does not matter that the target assigned to TA-1 and DA-1 was CST Station (according to the counsel for TA-1, no more than a public building) where they killed a large number of people or that they killed many others on Badruddin Tayabji Marg and in Cama Hospital. What matters is that the attack was aimed at India and Indians. It was by foreign nationals. People were killed for no other reason than they were Indians; in case of foreigners, they were killed because their killing on Indian soil would embarrass India. The conspiracy, in furtherance of which the attack was made, was, inter alia, to hit at India; to hit at its financial centre; to try to give rise to communal tensions and create internal strife and insurgency; to demand that India should give up Kashmir; and to dictate its relations with other countries. It was in furtherance of those objectives that the attack was made, causing the loss of lives of a large number of people and injury to an even greater number of people. Nothing could have been more \"in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy would do\".

The High Comt confitmed the death sentence on five counts given to TA-I by the tiial court. (Paras 546 and 54 7) As to the charge of waging war against India and TA-I being personally responsible for the killing of 7 people, including navigator of wooden boat, Kuber, those are fully in accord with the findings in the present appeal, an:ived at independently, and hence, the High Court was quite justified in taking those facts into account for determining the punishment for TA- I. (Para 552) It is indeed con:ect that TA-1 is quite young, but having said that one would think that nothing was left to be said for him. However, the counsel for TA-1 has more things to say. If the said submission is taken one step further it would almost appear as if it was a conspiracy by destiny that pushed TA-1 to commit all his tenible deeds, and all those who were killed or injured in Mumbai were predestined to be visited by his violence. The Court has no absolute belief in the philosophical doctrine of predetermination and, therefore, the said submissions are unacceptable. The Court must judge the actions of TA-I and the offences committed by him as expressions of his free will, for which he alone is responsible and must face the punishment. (Paras 553 and 554) [Ed.: The philosophical theory of predetermination that all events of this world at any particular time are fixed and predetermined, may either spring from the idea of theological determinism or the idea of causal determinism. Theological determinism believes that God foresees the future, which is therefore, in some sense already a fact. Causal determinism is the idea that every event is necessitated by causes antecedent to present point of time, thus giving rise to an endless cause and effect stream. And this cause and effect is governed by the laws of nature. Some philosophers argue that if cause and effect govern everything, there is no scope for any \"chance\" or \"objective probability\". Philosophers differ as to whether objective chance and probability are compatible with the idea that everything is predetermined. When human actions are examined, some philosophers say that determinism seems to be a threat to human free agency. However, others like David Hume go on to argue that determinism is a necessary condition for freedom. There is long tradition of compatibilist arguing that freedom is fully compatible with physical determinism. However, there are equally numerous and vigorous responses by those who are not convinced. See in this regard: (a) Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy by Simon Blackburn at page 298, and (b) web address http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ as verified on 5-10-2012.J ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

He joined the Lashkar-e-Toiba around December 2007 and continued as its member till the end , despite a number of opportunities to leave it. This shows his clear and unmistakable intention to be a part of the organisation and participate in its designs. Even after his arrest he regarded himself as a \"watan parast\", a patriotic Pakistani at war with this country. Where is the question of his being brainwashed or acting under remote control? TA-I was not acting like an automaton. It is true that he is not educated but he is a very good and quick learner, has a tough mind and strong determination. He is also quite clever and shrewd. Unfortunately, he is wholly remorseless and any feeling of pity is unknown to him. He kills without the slightest twinge of conscience. Leaving aside all the massacre, reference may be made only to the casualness with which TA-I and his associate DA-1 shot down Gupta bhelwala and the shanty-dwellers Thakur Waghela and Bhagan Shinde at Badruddin Tayabji Marg; the attempt to break into the wards of Cama Hospital to kill the women and children who were crying and wailing inside; and the nonchalance with which he and DA-1 gunned down the police officer Durgude on coming out of Cama Hospital. (Para 555) The saddest and the most disturbing part of the case is that TA-I never showed any remorse for the terrible things he did. As seen earlier, in the initial weeks after his arrest he continued to regard himself as a \"watan parast\", a patriotic Pakistani who considered himself to be at war with this country, who had no use for an Indian lawyer but needed a Pakistani lawyer to defend him in the court. He made the confessional statement before the Magistrate on 17-2-2009, not out of any sense of guilt or sorrow or grief but to present himself as a hero. He told the Magistrate that he had absolutely no regret for whatever he had done and he wanted to make the confession to set an example for others to become fidayeen like him and follow him in his deeds. Even in the course of the trial he was never repentant and did not show any sign of contrition. The Judge trying him had occasion to watch him closely and has repeatedly observed about the lack of any remorse on the part of TA- I. The High Court, too, has noticed that TA-I never showed any remorse for the large-scale murder committed by him. This, forecloses the possibility of any reform or rehabilitation of TA- I. The alternative option of life sentence is thus unquestionably excluded in the case of TA-I and death remains the only punishment that can be given to him. (Para 556) If the present case is examined in the light of M achhi Singh, ( 1983) 3 SCC 470 decision, it would not only satisfy all the conditions laid down in that decision for imposition of death sentence but also present several other features that could not have been conceived of by the Court in Machhi Singh case. It can even be said that every single reason that the Supreme Court might have assigned for confirming a death sentence in the past is to be found in this case in a more magnified way. (Para 561) This case has the element of conspiracy as no other case. TA-I was part of a conspiracy hatched across the border to wage war against the Government of India and lethal arms and explosives were collected with the intention of waging war against the Government of India. The conspiracy was to launch a murderous attack on Mumbai regarding it as the financial centre of the country; to kill as many Indians and foreign nationals as possible; to take Indians and foreign nationals as hostages for using them as bargaining chip in regard to the terrorists' a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 39 demands; and to try to incite communal strife and insurgency; all with the intent to weaken the country from within. (Para 562) The case presents the element of previous planning and preparation as no other case. For execution of the conspiracy, TA-1 and 9 other dead accused, his accomplices, were given rigorous and extensive training as combatants. The planning for the attack was meticulous and greatly detailed. The route from Karachi to Mumbai, the landing site at Mumbai, the different targets at Mumbai were all predetermined. The nature of the attack by the different teams of terrorists was planned and everyone was given clear instructions as to what they were supposed to do at their respective targets. All the terrorists, including TA-1, actually acted according to the previous planning. A channel of communication between the attacking terrorists and their handlers and collaborators from across the border, based on advanced computer technology and procured through deception, was already arranged and put in place before the attack was launched. This case has the element of waging war against tl1e Government of India and the magnitude of the war is of a degree as in no other case. And TA-1 is convicted on the charge, among others, of waging war against the Government of India. (Paras 563 and 564) This case has shocked the collective conscience of the Indian people as few other cases have. The number of persons killed and injured is not only staggeringly high but also as in no other or in extremely few cases. The offences committed by TA-1 show a degree of cmelty, bmtality and depravity as in very few other cases. TA-1, as also the other 9 terrorists, his co-conspirators, used highly lethal weapons such as AK-47 rifles, 9 mm pistols, and grenades and RDX bombs. As to the personality of the victims, all the persons killed/injured were harmless, defenceless people. What is more, they did not even know TA-1 and TA-1 too had no personal animus against them. He killed/injured them simply because they happened to be Indians. Clearly TA-1 never showed any repentance or remorse, which is the first sign of any possibility of reform and rehabilitation. (Paras 565 to 566 and 569 to 572) In short, this is a case of terrorist attack from across the border. It has a magnitude of unprecedented enormity on all scales. The conspiracy behind the attack was as deep and large as it was vicious. The preparation and training for the execution was as thorough as the execution was mthless. In terms of loss of life and property, and more importantly in its traumatising effect, this case stands alone, or it is at least the very rarest of rare to come before the Supreme Court since the birth of tl1e Republic. Therefore, it should also attract the rarest of tl1e rare punishment. (Para 573) Against all this, the only mitigating factor is TA-l's young age, but that is completely offset by the absence of any remorse on his part, and the resultant finding that in his case there is no possibility of any reformation or rehabilitation.

Bharat Chaganlal Raghani, (2001) 9 SCC 1, paras 1 and 63 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 377, distinguished on facts Putting the matter once again quite simply, in India death as a penalty has been held to be constitutionally valid, though it is indeed to be awarded in the \"rarest of rare cases when the alternative option ( of life sentence) is unquestionably foreclosed\". Now, as long as the death penalty remains on the statute book as punishment for certain offences, including \"waging war\" and murder, it logically follows that there must be some cases, howsoever rare or one in a million, that would call for inflicting that penalty. That being the position the case of TA- I is but a case which would attract the death penalty. To hold back the death penalty in this case would amount to obdurately declaring that the Supreme Court rejects death as lawful penalty even though it is on the statute book and held valid by the Constitutional Benches of the Supreme Court. Thus there is no option but to hold that in the facts of the case the death penalty is the only sentence that can be given to TA-I. The convictions and sentences of TA-I passed by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court is therefore, affirmed. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. (Paras 577 to 579) State of Maharashtra v. Mohd. Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab, (2011) 2 AIR Born 648, affirmed Per Prasad, J. (supplementing) In all human affairs absolute certainty is myth. Ordinarily, the El Dorado theory of \"absolute proof' being unattainable, the law accepts for it probability as a working substitute. Hardly does one come across a case where the court does not resort to \"certain probability\" as working substitute for proof beyond all reasonable doubt. However, in the case in hand, the evidence, oral and documentary makes me believe that \"absolute certainty\" may not necessarily be a myth or fake in all cases and can be a reality. Here, I am more than certain that the planning and conspiracy to commit the crime were hatched in Pakistan, the perpetrators of crime were Pakistani trained at different centres in that country, and the devastation which took place at various places in the city of Mumbai, were executed by TA- I in furtherance thereof. (Paras 599 to 601) [Ed.: Regarding the myth of El Dorado, the web address <http ://www.unexplainedstuff.com/Places-of-Mystery-and- Power/El-Dorado.html>, reflects as follows \"Europeans of the sixteenth century presumed that somewhere deep in South America was a vast city called El Dorado that contained unimaginable mineral riches. Several Spanish conquistadors made perilous, often deadly journeys to find it. Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618), the English raconteur, explorer, and visionary, claimed in a book he published in 1596 that he knew the whereabouts of El Dorado. But in spite of such valiant efforts, El Dorado seems to persist only as a symbol of the rapacious greed with which the English and Spanish beheld the New World ... \".

Mr Ramachandran, cool and clinical, gently tried to persuade the Court to his point of view. In the course of the hearing of the case, which was spread over 13 weeks, not once were the voices raised, not once was the counsel of the other side inte1TUpted and contradicted on a statement of fact. In my twenty years on the Bench I have not heard a serious case debated in such a congenial atmosphere as created by the counsels for the State and appellant in tl1is case. (Para 592) Mr Ramachandran, appearing for TA-I, was assisted by Mr Gaurav Agrawal and a small team of juniors. Mr Subramanium, representing the State of Maharashtra, was assisted by Mr Ujjawal Nikam, the Special Public Prosecutor who conducted the trial and a team of juniors. The juniors' teams also showed remarkable preparation and resourcefulness. Any query on facts was answered in no time with reference to volume number and page number from the records that appeared like a small mountain. The Supreme Court shows its indebtedness and gratitude to both the counsel and their team. (Para 593) In this case there were heroes like Tukaram Ombale, Hemant Karkare, Ashok Kamte, Vijay Salaskar and Sandeep Unnikrishnan, who lost their lives in the fight against terrorism. We salute every policeman, every member of the security forces and otl1ers who laid down their lives saving others and helping to catch or neutralise the ten terrorists. We have great admiration for the courage and sense of duty shown by the policemen and the members of the security forces who received injuries in discharge of their duties and we extend our deepest sympathies to them for their injuries. We compliment all those who showed great presence of mind and professionalism and, caring little for their own safety, saved countless lives or photographed the terrorists on their killing spree thus providing unimpeachable evidence for the court. We mourn the death of 148 civilians, both Indians and foreign nationals, who fell victim to the orgy of terror unleashed on the city, and extend our heartfelt condolences to their families. We also extend our deepest sympathies to all the 238 people who suffered injuries at the hands of the terrorists. We also greatly compliment the resilient spirit of Mumbai that, to all outward appearances, recovered from the blow very quickly and was back to business as usual in no time. In the course of hearing of the appeal we also came to know the trial Judge Shri Tahiliani. From the records of the case he appears to be a stem, no-nonsense person. But he is a true flag-bearer of the rule of law in this country. The manner in which he conducted the trial proceedings and maintained the record is exemplary. We seriously recommend that the trial court records of this case be included in the curriculum of the National Judicial Academy and the Judicial Academies of the different States as a model for criminal trial proceedings. We direct the Maharashtra Government to pay a sum of rupees eleven lakh to Mr Raju Ramachandran and rupees three lakh fifty thousand to Mr Gaurav Agrawal as token remuneration for their very valuable assistance to the Court. The payments should be made within two months from today*. (Paras 594 to 596) * Ed.: But see Mohd . Ajmal Amir Kasab v.

From the transcripts , especially those from Taj Hotel and Nariman House , it is evident that the terrorists who were entrenched at those places and more than them , their collaborators across the border were watching the full show on TV. In the transcripts there are many references to the media reports and the visuals being shown on the TV screen. The collaborators sitting in their hideouts across the border came to know about TA-1 being caught alive from Indian TV: they came to know about the killing of high-ranking police officers also from Indian TV. At one place in the transc1ipt , the collaborators and the terrorists appear to be making fun of the speculative report in the media that the person whose dead body was found in Kuber was the leader of the terrorist group whom his colleagues had killed for some reason before leaving the boat. At another place in the transc1ipt the collaborators tell the te1Torists in Taj Hotel that the dome at the top ( of the building) had caught fire. The terrorists holed up in some room were not aware of this. The collaborators further advise the terrorists that the stronger they make the fire the better it would be for them. At yet another place the terrorists at Hotel Taj tell the collaborators that they had thrown a grenade. The collaborators reply, \"the sound of the grenade has come , they have shown the grenade , the explosion has taken place, people are wounded\". At yet another place the collaborators tell the terrorists at Hotel Oberoi that the troops were making their position very strong on the roof of the building. At yet another place the collaborators tell the terrorists at Taj Hotel the exact position taken by the policemen (close to a building that belonged to the Navy but was given to the civilians) and from where they were taking aim and firing at them (the terrorists) and advised them the best position for them to hit back at those policemen. There are countless such instances to show that the collaborators were watching practically every movement of the security forces that were trying to tackle the terrorists under relentless gunfire and throwing of grenades from their end.

All the channels were competing with each other in showing the latest developments on a minute-to- minute basis, including the positions and the movements of the security forces engaged in flushing out the terrorists. The reckless coverage of the terrorist attacks by the channels thus gave rise to a situation where on the one hand the terrorists were completely hidden from the security forces and they had no means to know their exact position or even the kind of firearms and explosives they possessed and on the other hand the positions of the security forces, their weapons and all their operational movements were being watched by the collaborators across the border on TV screens and being communicated to the terrorists. (Para 394) In these appeals, it is not possible to find out whether the security forces actually suffered any casualty or injuries on account of the way their operations were being displayed on the TV screen. But it is beyond doubt that the way their operations were freely shown made the task of the security forces not only exceedingly difficult but also dangerous and risky. (Para 395) Any attempt to justify the conduct of the TV channels by citing the right to freedom of speech and expression would be totally wrong and unacceptable in such a situation. The freedom of expression, like all other freedoms under Article 19, is subject to reasonable restrictions. An action tending to violate another person's right to life guaranteed under Article 21 or putting the national security in jeopardy can never be justified by taking the plea of freedom of speech and express10n. (Para 396) The shots and visuals that were shown live by the TV channels could have also been shown after all the terrorists were neutralised and the security operations were over. But, in that case the TV programmes would not have had the same shrill, scintillating and chilling effect and would not have shot up the TRP ratings of the channels. It must, therefore, be held that by covering live the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in the way it was done, the Indian TV channels were not serving any national interest or social cause. On the contrary they were acting in their own commercial interests putting the national security in jeopardy. (Para 397) It is in such extreme cases that the credibility of an institution is tested. The coverage of the Mumbai terror attack by the mainstream electronic media has done much harm to the argument that any regulatory mechanism for the media must only come from within.

(for himself and Prasad, J.; Prasad, J., supplementing)- The appellant, Mohammed Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab alias Abu Mujahid (hereinafter referred to as \"the appellant\" or as \"Kasab\"), who is a Pakistani national, has earned for himself five death penalties and an equal number of life terms in prison for committing multiple crimes of a horrendous kind in this country. Some of the major charges against him were: conspiracy to wage war against the Government of India; collecting arms with the intention of waging war against the Government of India; waging and abetting the waging of war against the Government of India; commission of terrorist acts; criminal conspiracy to commit murder; criminal conspiracy, common intention and abetment to commit murder; committing murder of a number of persons; attempt to murder with common intention; criminal conspiracy and abetment; abduction for murder; robbery/dacoity with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt; and causing explosions punishable under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. He was found guilty of all these charges besides many others and was awarded the death sentence on five counts, life sentence on five other counts, as well as a number of relatively lighter sentences of imprisonment for the other offences. 2. Apart from the appellant, two other accused, namely, Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahamed, both Indian nationals, were also arraigned before the trial court and indicted on the same charges as the appellant. At the end of the trial, however, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to death as noted above (vide judgment and order dated 3-5-2010/6-5-2010 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Greater Mumbai in Sessions Case No. 175 of 2009). The other two accused were acquitted of all charges. The trial court gave them the benefit of the doubt as regards the charges of conspiracy and abetment of other offences by conspiracy, and further held that the prosecution completely failed to establish those other charges that were made directly against them. 3. The judgment by the trial court gave rise to a reference to the Bombay High Court under Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\"CrPC\"), registered as Confirmation Case No. 2 of 2010. In addition to the reference, two appeals also came to the High Court from the judgment and order passed by the trial court, one by the appellant against his conviction and sentences (Criminal Appeal No. 738 of 2010) and the other by the State of Maharashtra against the acquittal of the other two accused (Criminal Appeal No. 606 of 2010). The High Court, by its judgment and order dated 21-2-20111, confirmed the death sentences given to the appellant by the trial court and dismissed both the appeals. The High Court upheld the judgment and order passed by the trial court in all material aspects: it sustained the appellant's conviction and confirmed the punishments given to him by the trial court, but * Ed.: Prasad, J. delivered a supplementing opinion as well. 1 State of Maharashtra v.

From the judgment of the High Court two appeals have come to this Court: one is a jail appeal by Kasab and the other is by the State of Maharashtra. The State's appeal seeks to challenge the acquittal of the other two accused by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court. The other two accused are impleaded in the State's appeal as Respondents 1 and 2. Kasab was unrepresented in the appeal preferred by him from jail and this Court, therefore, appointed Mr Raju Ramachandran, Senior Advocate, assisted by Mr Gaurav Agrawal, to represent him. He was thus able to get legal assistance of a standard and quality that is not available to a majority of Indian nationals approaching this Court against their conviction and sentence. 5. We may also state here that since it is a case of death sentence, we intend to examine the materials on record first hand, in accordance with the time-honoured practice of this Court, and come to our own conclusions on all issues of facts and law, unbound by the findings of the trial court and the High Court. 6. According to the prosecution, a sinister conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan and in furtherance of that conspiracy a savage attack was unleashed on Mumbai by a team of ten terrorists, including Kasab, who landed on the city's shores via the Arabian Sea. The attack began on 26-11-2008 at about 9.15 p.m. and it ended when the last of the attackers, who was holed up in Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, was killed by Indian security forces at about 9.00 a.m. on November 29. The brutal assault left Mumbai scarred and traumatised and the entire country shocked. The terrorists killed one hundred and sixty-six (166) people and injured, often grievously, two hundred and thirty-eight (238) people. 2 The loss to property resulting from the terrorist attack was assessed at over rupees one hundred and fifty crores (Rs 150 crores ). The dead included eighteen ( 18) policemen and other security personnel and twenty-six (26) foreign nationals. The injured included thirty-seven (37) policemen and other security personnel and twenty-one (21) foreign nationals. Of those dead, at least seven (7) were killed by the appellant personally, seventy-two (72) were killed by him in furtherance of the common intention he shared with one Abu Ismail (deceased Accused 1) and the rest were victims of the conspiracy to which he was a party along with the nine (9) dead accused and thirty-five (35) other accused who remain to be apprehended and brought to court. 3 7. The case of the prosecution is based, of course, on investigations by the police, but a good deal of it also comes from the confessional statement of the appellant recorded under Section 164 CrPC. The confession of the 2 A complete list of people killed and injured is appended at the bottom of the judgment as Schedule I, forming part of the judgment. a b C d e f g 3 A complete list of the accused in three categories i.e. (i) the three who faced the trial, (ii) the nine who died in course of commission of the crimes, and (iii) the thirty-five (35) who remain h to be apprehended is appended at the bottom of this judgment as Schedule II, forming part of the judgment. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 49 appellant may be broadly divided into two parts, one relating to the conspiracy, planning and preparation for the attack, and the other relating to the actual attack on Mumbai, in execution of the conspiracy of which the appellant along with his \"buddia\" 4 , the accomplice Abu Ismail, was a part. So far as the attack on Mumbai is concerned, every statement made by the appellant is corroborated over and over again by objective findings and evidences gathered by the prosecution. But the conspiracy and the preparation for the attack took place in Pakistan and, therefore, it was impossible for any agency of this country to make investigations in regard to that part of the case. Nevertheless, the investigators have been able to gather extensive material to corroborate even that part of the appellant's confession. 8. It would thus be convenient to present the case of the prosecution by beginning with the appellant's confessional statement. The recording of the confessional statement 9. The appellant was brought before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai, on 17-2-2009, to make his confessional statement. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate referred him to Mrs Sawant Wagule, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Third Court, Esplanade, Mumbai, before whom he was presented for recording his confessional statement in CR No. 198 of 2008 of Detection of Crime Branch, Mumbai [one of the twelve (12) cases registered in connection with the offences committed by the invading group of terrorists] at 10.45 a.m. on the same day. 10. Mrs Sawant Wagule proceeded to take his statement very slowly and with great circumspection. First of all, she had the appellant completely insulated from the police. She explained to him that from that point he was in her custody and not in the custody of the police. She asked him whether he was ill-treated or abused by the police in any manner and why he wanted to make the confessional statement. To her first question the appellant replied in the negative, and as for the reasons for him making a confession he said he would explain everything when his statement was recorded in detail. The Magistrate further satisfied herself that the appellant was willing to make the confessional statement voluntarily and not under any pressure, coercion or allurement by the police or anyone else. Nonetheless, she did not take his statement on that day but told him that she wanted him to reflect further on the matter, for which purpose she was giving him 24 hours' time. She then remanded him to judicial custody where he was not accessible to the police or any other agency. 11. When the appellant was brought back to her on February 18 at 11 a.m., she had another long exchange with him. In the preliminary exchanges on the previous day she had found that the appellant had no difficulty in following or speaking in Hindi; thus, the interaction between the Magistrate and the appellant took place, in question and answer form, in simple, everyday spoken Hindi. The Magistrate, having satisfied herself that the 4 A term used by the appellant; vernacular adaptation of buddy. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

She a explained to him that he was under no compulsion to make the confessional statement and further, that whether he made the confessional statement or not, he would not be handed back to the police. She confirmed once again that the appellant wished to make the statement of his own volition and not under any influence. 12. The appellant told her his name and gave his address of a place in b Pakistan. She asked him about his education and where, when and how he was arrested by the police. She asked him why was he brought to her and in reply he said that he wanted to make a confessional statement. She asked for which offence he wanted to make confession. He replied that on 26-11-2008, he and his accomplices made a fidayeen attack on Mumbai City and he wanted to make a confession about the attack and the conspiracy behind it. c She asked when he felt like making a confession. He told her that the thought of making the confession came to him when he was a1rested by the police. He added that he had absolutely no regret for whatever he had done. He wanted to make the confession to set an example for others to become fidayeen like him and follow him in his deeds. The Magistrate cautioned him by saying that he should make the statement only if he wished to do so. She d further cautioned him by saying that any confessional statement made by him would be taken down in writing and it would be used as evidence against him and that might lead to his conviction. The appellant said that he was aware of the consequences. The Magistrate again asked him whether the police had given any inducement to him to make the confessional statement, such as by offering to make him an approver. He replied in the negative. She then asked e if he needed an advocate while making the confession. Once again, he answered in the negative. 13. Even after this lengthy and detailed interaction, the learned Magistrate did not take his confession on that day but gave him a period of 48 hours for further reflection, telling him that during that period he would not be in police custody but would be kept in jail in her custody. She advised f him to reconsider the matter with a composed mind. She then remanded him to judicial custody with the direction that he be produced before her on 20-2-2009, at 11 a.m. 14. The appellant was produced before the Magistrate as directed, on February 20 at 10.40 a.m. The Magistrate repeated the entire gamut of explanations and cautions at the end of which the appellant said that he still g wanted to make his confession. It was only then did the learned Magistrate proceed to record the statement made by the appellant under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The statement could not be fully recorded on February 20 and it was resumed on February 21 at 10.40 a.m. On that date, the recording of the statement was completed.

After recording his statement, she also gave such certificates as required under sub-section ( 4) of Section 164 CrPC. 15. Coming now to the main body of the confessional statement, it is in the form of a statement made by the appellant with only minimal interjections by the learned Magistrate. She occasionally asked the appellant to clarify the meaning of some uncommon words or code words used in the conspiracy. The appellant's statement, made before the Magistrate over two days is long and rambling, at points repetitive and full of seemingly superfluous details that would appear quite unnecessary if one is to take a limited view of the case and judge the culpability of the appellant only on the basis of the events in Mumbai. To that end, it would be quite simple and convenient to give a brief summary of the appellant's confessional statement. But such an approach will not do justice to the case and we intend to take a look at the full statement of the appellant with all its repetitions and details. We do so to be fair to both the prosecution and the appellant. The details given by the appellant have a bearing on the prosecution case, according to which conspiracy, conspiracy to wage war against India and waging war against India are some of the main crimes in the case, and the details given by the appellant throw a great deal of light on the commission of those crimes. Further, the details in the appellant's statement are relevant to the submission that the confessional statement is not truly voluntary but that the appellant was manipulated into making that statement. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that no accused making an admission of his guilt would ref er to those unnecessary details and that the great detail of the confessional statement only shows that it was not the appellant but the prosecution that was speaking through his mouth. We, therefore, scan the confession as it is, in full, unabridged and unadorned. The Kasab narrative Family background 16. The appellant started by g1vmg his name as Mohammed Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab. He was born on 13-9-1987.

He lived in the village with his abbu Mohammad Amir Shaban Kasab, his ammi Noor-e-Elahi, younger brother Munir and younger sister Surraiya. He gave his father's mobile phone number. He had an elder sister and an elder brother, both of whom were married. The sister lived with her husband in a village in Pathankot, District Okara, and the brother lived in Lahore with his wife. He gave the names of the spouses of the elder sister and the elder brother and their respective addresses. 17. After the immediate family he gave the names of his three paternal uncles, elder to his father, and their sons, who lived in Village Mohammad Yar Chishti, Pathankot, District Okara, Pakistan .

He then gave the names of his mamoon (mother's brother) and his three sons and a daughter and their address; and the name of his khaloo (mother's sister's husband), his address and mobile phone number. 19. He gave the name of another sister of his mother whom he called \"Mamo\" and her address. 20. He had two paternal aunts who were manied. He gave their names and their addresses. He said that his mamoon and mousi (mother's brother and sister) had grown-up children. 21. Kasab added that his house at Faridkot had been taken by his father who earned his livelihood by plying carts. Kasab was fond of watching TV and Hindi movies; he named a number of popular Indian films that he had seen many times. He was in the habit of chewing tobacco. He was good friends with the village doctor, Mazhar, who had a dispensary near Faridkot Bus-stop. 22. After dropping out of school in the year 2000, Kasab and his friend Dittu started working as labourers in Faridkot. In 2001, he and his abbu went to Lahore in search of employment. In Lahore he lived with his father and uncle, Ghulam Rasool, in a house they rented from Haji Qamar. He gave the detailed address of the house. On his father's instructions, Kasab started working as a labourer at \"Mazdooron Ka Adda\". He worked there for about five years. In the year 2005, his father and uncle returned to their village. Kasab continued to stay in Lahore alone, living in rented accommodation. During this period he used to visit his village home. On one such visit, he quanelled with his abbu over the money earned by him. After the quanel he left the home and started living at Ali Hajveri Dargah in Lahore. Kasab's friend Shafique got him a job in Welcome Tent Service. He gave the full address of the establishment, the name of its owner and the mobile phone numbers of the owner and his son. He added that the owner of the establishment used to call him \"Balka\". It was here that Kasab met and befriended Muzaffar Lal Khan, who also worked there.

In November 2007, Kasab and Muzaffar Lal Khan went to Rawalpindi in search of better employment and took rented accommodation a b C d e f in Bangash Colony. It was here, around the month of December, that they saw members of Lashkar-e-Toiba going from door to door under the name of Jamat-ul-Dava, collecting hides of goats sacrificed on Eid-ul-Zuha. They were asking people to donate the goat hides to help achieve independence for Kashmir. Kasab and his friend developed great respect for those people. They g thought that those people were fighting for the liberation of Kashmir and they, too, should do something for their people. When they were working at Sarai Alamgir members of Jamat-ul-Dava were organising camps at different places where they would go to listen to their speeches. He explained that after Lashkar-e-Toiba was banned in 2002, it started its activities in the name of Jamat-ul-Dava. At this time, Kasab and Muzaffar Lal Khan first thought of h undergoing training for Jihad. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In December 2007, they took the address of the office of Lashkar-e- Toiba from a moulvi and reached its office at Raja Bazaar, Rawalpindi. He added that the office was near Bangash Colony. There were two persons in the office who asked them the purpose of their visit. They replied that they wanted to undertake Jihad. The office people took their address in full and asked them to come the following day, with their clothes and other belongings. They returned the following day. On that day, a person in the office gave them a slip of paper with \"Daura-e-Suffa, Markaz-e-Toiba, Muridke\" written on it. He gave them directions for Muridke and told them to go there. They left for Muridke and, after travelling by bus for six hours, they reached Muridke Bus-stand. From there, they walked for about a kilometre- and-a-half to reach the camp site. To the person there, they showed the letter and said that they had come for Daura-e-Suffa. After subjecting them to a search, he took them inside the office. There they showed the letter to a person called Fahadullah (wanted Accused 8). He wrote down their names and addresses and admitted them for the training. 25. Daura-e-Suffa training lasted for twenty-one (21) days. There were thirty (30) other boys, apart from Kasab and his friend, doing the training. During this, they were first converted from Sunni (sect of Islam) to Ahl-e- Hadis and were given lessons in the Hadis (a study of the things said by the Prophet Muhammad and descriptions of his daily life). An Ustad conducted physical exercises. Besides, they were given lectures and lessons on Jihad. In those sessions Fahadullah and Mufti Sayeed (wanted Accused 13) were the Ustad. The training took place between December 2007 and January 2008. In the course of the training, Ustad Abu Kafa (wanted Accused 5) introduced them to Hafiz Sayeed, the Ameer of Lashkar-e-Toiba (wanted Accused 1), Operational Commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi (wanted Accused 2), Area Commander Abu Al-Kama (wanted Accused 4), Muzzamil alias Yusuf (wanted Accused 6), Training Incharge Abu Umar Sayeed (wanted Accused 18) and Abu Hamza (wanted Accused 3). Kasab added that Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi was known as \"Chacha\" and \"Lakhvi\". At that time Kafa told them that Abu Umar Sayeed arranged the training camps of Lashkar-e-Toiba. [At this point the learned Magistrate interrupted him to ask the meaning of the word Ameer. He said it meant leader.] 26. Kasab said that Ameer Hafiz Sayeed exhorted them by saying that all Mujahedeens must fight for the independence of Kashmir; Zaki-ur-Rehman announced that the time had come for Jihad, adding that their organisation had been fighting in Kashmir for the last fifteen ( 15) years but the Hindustani Government was not allowing Kashmir to be independent. It had, therefore, become necessary to fight a war against Hindustan to capture Kashmir. Zaki- ur-Rehman Lakhvi asked them if they were ready to wage the war. They all said they were ready for the war. At that time, Abu Al-Kama told them that they had to attack the major cities of Hindustan; that they would wage war against Hindustan from within, so that it is weakened from the inside. He added that anyone who would die in this war would go to paradise.

They travelled for twelve (12) hours by bus to reach Mansera Bus-stand from where they had to walk into the hilly region. There, at the entrance to the camp they were subjected to a search. They showed Fahadullah's note to the person at the gate and were allowed into the office. The person in the office wrote down detailed b information concerning them in a register. After staying there for the day, they were taken to Buttel Village in a van. From there the driver of the van led them to the top of the hill on foot - a walk of about thirty (30) minutes. 28. In this second training of twenty-one (21) days they did physical exercises and practised running and climbing over mountains. They were also given training in dismantling and assembling \"Kalashan\", rifles and pistols C and taught how to fire these weapons. [Here the Magistrate asked him the meaning of \"Kalashan\".

He said that he remained to do \"Khidmat\" of the Mujahedeens. The \"Ustad'' for the trainees who came there during Kasab's \"Khidmat\" were Abu Abdul Rehman (wanted Accused 9), Yusuf (wanted Accused 15), Abu Anas (wanted Accused 10) and Abu Bashir (wanted Accused 11).

He also gave them the address of the Lashkar-e-Toiba training camp at Muzaffarabad. 33. All of them travelled 16/17 hours in a bus to Muzaffarabad. Kasab added that Muzaffarabad is in POK. From there they walked for about an hour and, passing through a Lashkar-e-Toiba hospital called Neelam Dariya, they reached Sevai Nala. At that place there were 10/12 houses and a masjid of Lashkar-e-Toiba and the settlement was called \"Baitul Mujahedeen\". They gave the rukka (chit) to a person called Sayeed and entered the training camp, which was also called \"Maskar Aksa\". The camp was situated on Chehalbandi Hills of Muzaff arabad. There was high security in this training camp and restrictions on moving in or out of the camp without the permission of the \"Ustacf'. Abu Muavia (wanted Accused 28) was the \"Ustacf' of this training, which was conducted in the months of May, June and July 2008. 34. Kasab told the Magistrate that this training was of two-and-a-half- months in course of which they were turned into solid \"Jihadis\". They were given lessons in Hadis, Namaz and Quran. In addition, they were taught to dismantle and assemble Kalashans and many kinds of rifles and pistols, and to fire from those weapons, to operate rocket launchers and the use of hand-grenades. They were also given training in the use of satellite phones, GPS systems and map-reading. The physical exercise comprised staying without food for 60 hours while climbing mountains with heavy loads on the back. He added that the training was very arduous, so much so that ten (10) Mujahedeens fled from the training camp. Abu Muavia and Abu Hanzala (wanted Accused 31) were the \"Ustacf' for this Daura. 35. During that training, a person unknown to Kasab visited the camp. At that time, Ameer Hafiz Sayeed, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Kafa were present there. Ameer Hafiz Sayeed and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi embraced the visitor, and Ustad Abu Muavia and Abu Hanzala saluted him in soldier style. Kafa introduced him to the trainees as Major-General Saab (wanted Accused 20) adding that the persons who were giving them training were his men. Major-General Saab asked them their names and inquired about their training. He asked whether they had any complaints. They all answered that they had none. Major-General Saab left after talking to them for about an hour. [At this point, the Magistrate asked Kasab for the name of Major-General Saab. He said they were not told his name.] 36.

The Mujahedeens were shown a CD on the laptop demonstrating how Salauddin had made a fidayeen attack in Kashmir. Thereafter, Abu Al-Kama explained to them in detail how fidayeen attacks a were made in Kashmir. 38. Ameer Hafiz Sayeed selected them and gave them new names. He named Kasab \"Abu Mujahid\" and Imran Babar from Multan of Punjab region \"Abu Aqsa\"; Nasir of Faisalabad was named \"Abu Umar\" and Nazir Ahmed \"Abu Omair\", Hafiz Arshad of Multan Road, Punjab, was called Abdul Rehman \"Bada\" alias Hayaji, Abdul Rehman (Chhota) of Multan Road, b Arabwala , was called \"Saqib\", Soheb from Narowala, Shakkar Garb, Punjab, was given the name \"Abu Soheb\". Some other colleagues of Kasab, who came from different places in Pakistan and whose names he did not recall but whom he identified with reference to the places from which they came, were similarly given pseudonyms by Hafiz Sayeed. 39. On the same day in the evening they were taken to the office of Baitul c Mujahedeen. 40. The fifteen ( 15) selected persons then left for Markaz-e- Toiba, Muridke, for the Daura-e-Ribat training. In this session, which lasted for one month, they were given intelligence training, such as gathering knowledge about the target, keeping watch on him, following him and dodging if d someone were to follow them. Kasab described one of these tricks to the Magistrate, telling her that if they suspected that they were being followed, they would switch on the indicator light on the right and then suddenly take a left turn. That is how they would find out if they were being followed. They learnt how to use fake identities while on a mission. Training Incharge Abu Sayeed gave special attention to this training. He would frequently come to them and make queries about the training. e 41. During the training two of Kasab's colleagues, Nasad and Abu Muavia, left the camp and went away. 42. Abu Kafa and Imran (wanted Accused 12) were the Ustad of this Daura. During this training, Major-General Saab came there twice. He watched them train and encouraged them. The Daura was completed in the f end of August 2008. At that time Muzammil alias Yusuf and Abu Al-Kama had also come there. Major Saab asked them if they could swim, to which they answered in the affirmative. Then Major Saab asked Kafa to give them marine training. Kafa said he would do so. 43. A few days later, in September 2008, Kafa took them to Karachi by train. There they were lodged in a house in Azizabad mohalla. It was there in g the month of September 2008, that Ramzan started. Kafa took all the thirteen (13) Mujahedeens to the creek from where they all sailed to the sea at Karachi on two small boats. Here, they were put on a boat with an engine attached to it . On that boat a person called Hakim Saab (wanted Accused 14) gave them three days' marine training.

He replied that in order to deceive the naval officers of the enemy they would say they were fishermen.] 44. After the marine training, Kafa took them back to Baitul Mujahedeen. There, Ameer Hafiz Sayeed and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi asked them about the marine training. 45. Three days later, Ameer Hafiz Sayeed and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi sent six (6) Mujahedeens from among them (whose names Kasab told the Magistrate) for a fidayeen attack in Kashmir. On the following day, Abu Hamza introduced three men to their group: Ismail Khan from Dera Ismail Khan, Punjab, Fahadullah and Javed from Okara, Punjab. Hafiz Sayeed named them Abu Ismail, Abu Fahadullah and Abu Ali. Abu Hamza told the group that these three were fidayeens like them; they had also taken training like them and they were also going with them to carry out the attack on Hindustan. 46. On the thirteenth (13th) Roza Hafiz Sayeed, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Muzammil alias Yusuf, Al-Kama, Abu Hasan, Abu Kafa and Abu Umar Sayeed called them to the office of Baitul Mujahedeen. Ameer Hafiz Sayeed addressed them there. He said that the time for Jihad had come and they were now required to consider how best to launch the attack on Hindustan. After him Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi spoke and said that the economic strength of Hindustan lay in Bombay and it was therefore necessary to direct the attack on Bombay. He added that they had taken good marine training and hence they would attack Bombay from the sea route. Major-General Saab also came to this meeting. He embraced Ameer Hafiz and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and they talked to each other at some distance from the rest of the group. After a while they came to the group and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi said that Major- General Saab wanted to see their preparedness. Immediately, each of them was given a \"Kalashan\" and a loaded magazine. Major-General Saab asked Ameer Hafiz to have the targets fixed at which Ameer Hafiz directed Kafa to fix ten (10) targets. Major-General Saab said that when he shouted \"fire\" they should fire a single shot and when he shouted \"fire\" twice they were to make \"rapid firing\". 47. All of them took position. Major-General Saab watched them taking position and then he shouted \"fire\". Each of them fired a single shot. Except Imran Bahar, everyone shot the target. Ameer Hafiz Sayeed rebuked Imran Bahar severely. Major-General Saab, too, told Imran Bahar to practise shooting properly. Major-General Saab then asked everybody to take position. They all resumed position and Major-General Saab shouted \"fire\" twice. All of them emptied their magazines. Major-General Saab then walked up to the targets and inspected them closely. He asked who had fired at (target) No. 4. Kasab said it was he. Major-General Saab complemented him saying that he had destroyed the target entirely.

Then Kafa introduced them to a person called Zarar Shah (wanted a Accused 7). Kasab and Ismail asked him about Zarar Shah, at which he told them that Zarar Shah and Ibrahim were the Ameer of the media wing of their organisation. Zarar Shah was a computer expert. He could use computer technology to make a call from Pakistan appear, deceptively, as if it was being made from some other country. Zarar Shah and Ibrahim had set up a high technology media room. In this room they had collected maps, CDs and b other information concerning the major cities of every country in the world on the ba sis of which they selected the targets and advised Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi. 49. Ameer Hafiz Sayeed and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi then divided the ten (10) Mujahedeens into five (5) \"buddiyas\". [The Magistrate asked what a \"Buddiya\" was. Kasab said \"Buddiya\" meant a pair.] 50. The Buddiyas were: (1) Kasab and Ismail Khan; (2) Imran Babar and Nasir; (3) Soheb and Nazir Ahmed; (4) Hafiz Arshad alias Hayaji and Javed; and (5) Abdul Rehman (Chhota) and Fahadullah. C d 51. Then, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi told them that on the twenty-seventh (27th) Roza they were to go and make the fidayeen attack on Bombay. Ameer Hafiz Sayeed said to them that for going from Karachi to Bombay , a Hindustani boat would have to be hijacked and they would go to Bombay by that Hindustani boat. He added that the \"maali halat\" of Hindustan was based on \"videshi sailaniyon\" . Therefore, in order to weaken the \"maali halat\" of Hindustan it was necessary to attack, among other places, those places frequented by \"videshi sailaniyon\". [At this point the Magistrate interrupted to ask the meanings of \"maali halat\" and \"videshi sailani\". Kasab e translated the two expressions as \"money power\" and \"foreign tourists\".] 52. Ameer Hafiz Sayeed told them that they would fire from \"Kalashan\" while also throwing hand-grenades at VTS, Malabar Hill, Taj Hotel at Co lab a, Leopold Hotel, Oberoi Hotel and N ariman House Building where Israelis stayed in Bombay. He added that while firing they should specially target the Americans, the British and the Israelis because those people had f greatly oppressed the Muslims. At VTS there would be a very large crowd and while firing there they should not think of whether their targets were Muslims or Hindus. They should just open \"brush fire\" without any thought as to who they targeted. However, while firing at the hotels they should take care that no Muslim was killed in their attack. Then, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi asked the two \"buddies\" who were assigned the attack on the Taj Hotel and g the Oberoi Hotel to set the two hotels on fire and to cause damage to them on a large scale. Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi said that before launching the attack they must fix the RDX bombs around their targets. The bomb blasts would cause traffic jams and slow down the movement of the police coming to the rescue, and would thus make it easier for them to kill the policemen, besides many other people. h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ameer Hafiz Sayeed fixed the time for the attacks at 7.30 p.m. When Kasab asked why the attack should take place at that particular time, Hafiz Sayeed explained that this was the time when the targeted places would be most crowded, and insisted that the attack must take place at 7.30 p.m. Kafa told them that the ten (10) Mujahedeens, would be given ID cards with fake Hindu names and that they would go to Hindustan with those fake ID cards. On the way, they would also tie sacred threads around their wrists like Hindus do. When Ismail asked about the need for ID cards and threads, Kafa replied that with those ID cards nobody could stop them and they would be easily successful in their mission. And the threads on their wrists would deceive the police. 54. Continuing his story, Kasab told the Magistrate that at that meeting they decided that he and Ismail would begin firing at VTS to make piles of dead bodies. From VTS they would go to Malabar Hill and start firing there. Hafiz Arshad and Javed would do the firing at Hotel Taj; Fahadullah and Abdul Rehman (Chhota) at Hotel Oberoi; Imran Babar and Nasir at Nariman House; while Soheb and Nazir would begin firing at Hotel Leopold and then join Hafiz Arshad and Javed at the Taj Hotel. Further, while going to VTS he would plant an RDX bomb under the driver's seat in the taxi; Nazir Ahmed and Javed would similarly place the bombs in the taxis they would hire to Leopold Hotel and Taj Hotel respectively. The taxis used by them would thus explode at some other place and no one would have any clue regarding how they came and where they came from. The Buddiyas at Nariman House, Oberoi Hotel and Taj Mahal Hotel would talk to the media and falsely tell them that they had taken some people hostage and (on that strength) would ask the Hindustan Government to allow Kashmir to be free. They would deceive the media into believing that they were Hindustani Muslims in large numbers and would thus generate fear. 55. Ameer Hafiz said Abu Hamza would teach them how to plant RDX bombs and how to cause blasts. 56. Ameer Hafiz Sayeed, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Muzammil alias Yusuf, Abu Al-Kama, Abu Umar Sayeed, Kafa, Abu Hamza and Zarar Shah then took the ten (10) Mujahedeens to a big hall. In that hall there were two or three TVs. Zarar Shah told them that this was the control room of the media wing. Zarar Shah showed them the different roads of Bombay and their different targets on a big TV screen. He showed VTS and Malabar Hill to Kasab and Ismail Khan on a CD. He also gave them detailed information about the roads leading to VTS and Malabar Hill. Kafa used Google Earth on a laptop to show them how to go from Badhwar Park in Mumbai to VTS and from VTS to Malabar Hill. Kafa also showed them some maps that were drawn by hand and told them that Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed in Hindustan ( Accused 2 and 3) had prepared those maps and sent them from there. He said that with the help of those maps they would easily reach the places targeted by them. Having told them how the maps were obtained, Kafa explained the maps to them. Kasab asked where Sabauddin and Fahim were. Kafa said both of them were arrested in Hindustan.

Then, on the basis of one of the maps, he explained how long it would take them to go from a Badhwar Park to VTS and from there to Malabar Hill. Kafa told them that Cooperage Ground and Azad Maidan fall on the way to VTS and told them to mention those places to the taxi driver. Kafa gave similar information to the other \"buddiyas\" on the basis of the CD, Google Earth and the maps sent by Sabauddin and Fahim. 57. On the day of the fifteenth (15th) Roza, Abu Hamza and Kafa took b the ten (10) Mujahedeens to the hills of Muzaffarabad. There they practised how to take position and fire with Kalashans. They were also taught how to make the tiffin bomb from RDX, how to fix a blast timer into it and how to set off the bomb. At that time, on the instructions of Ameer Hafiz Sayeed, Abu Hamza and Kafa gave more firing practice to Imran Bahar. 58. The same night they returned to Baitul Mujahedeen. c 59. On the day of the sixteenth (16th) Roza, Kafa asked them to shave and cut their hair. They were given new clothes, shoes and socks. On Kafa's instruction they cut off the labels of the new clothes. Kafa also gave them watches set to Indian time. On the same day, Kafa had their photographs taken. 60. On the day of the seventeenth (17th) Roza, Kafa took them to d Karachi City by train and there they went to a house in Azizabad mohalla. Lying in the house was an Urdu magazine called Taibat that featured the names of the six (6) Mujahedeens who had gone on the Kashmir Mission and been martyred there. Kasab asked Kafa about them. Kafa said that their colleagues had become martyrs in the encounter with the Hindustani army e and that Allah would rest their souls in heaven. 61. On the day of the eighteenth (18th) Roza, Kafa brought ten (10) timers and explained to them how to fix a battery in the timer and how to set the time. On Kafa's instructions they affixed their names on one timer each, after which Kafa took the timers back from them. At that time, according to the plan, Kafa also gave all of them ID cards with their Hindu names. f Kasab's ID card showed him as Sameer Choudhary, son of Dinesh Choudhary of Arunodaya Degree College, Bangalore. Ismail's ID card described him as N aresh Verma, son of Vilas Verma of Arunodaya Degree College, Hyderabad. All the ID cards were of Arunodaya College. Kasab listed the different fake Hindu names given to the rest of his colleagues. 62. Kafa took them back to the Karachi harbour and they stayed on the g sea for one day. On that expedition, Hakim Saab taught them how to dismantle, assemble and run a small inflatable boat. He showed them how to take out the sea-valve and sink a boat.

He could make their mission successful, according to the plan, and there was no need for him to worry. Kasab further said that he had longed for it for so many years and asked Lakhvi not to create any obstrnctions. At this, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi started laughing and said that he knew from the beginning that he was a firm \"Jihadi\", but he asked him to wait for some time. The next day Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi left, b though the Mujahedeens continued to stay in the Azizabad house. During those days Imran Babar would make them repeat the names on their ID cards. Of them, Imran Babar alone was properly educated and he could, therefore, read and write English. 64. They celebrated \"Ramzan Eid\" in the Azizabad house. During this period Abu Hamza taught them how to plant a bomb under the seat in a c moving car and gave training to Kasab, Javed and Nazir Ahmed on how to plant a bomb under the (driver's) seat while sitting in the back seat of the car.

Zarar Shah replied that those numbers were of Hindustan. He added that they had obtained the SIM cards from Hindustan by tricking some people there. He added that the SIM cards would get activated on reaching Bombay. He asked them to use the phones on reaching Bombay. Kasab asked about the numbers on which they could talk to them.

He also gave each of them one (1) \"Kalashan\", eight (8) magazines, two hundred and forty (240) rounds, eight b (8) hand-grenades, one bayonet (Kasab called it \"sangeen\"), one (1) pistol with three (3) magazines, twenty-one (21) rounds, one (1) water bottle, one (1) kg raisins, one (1) headphone and three (3) nine (9) volt batteries along with a charger. He also gave each of them an RDX bomb of eight (8) kg that was kept in a tiffin box in a small sack. He also gave each \"buddy\" a GPS system and a small pouch to everyone to tie around the waist. c 69. All of them took their goods and cleaned and serviced the \"Kalashan\" and the pistol; put thirty (30) rounds in each magazine of their \"Kalashan\" and seven (7) in those of the pistol. As trained, they joined two (2) magazines together with tape so as to easily replace the magazine being emptied while firing from \"Kalashan\". They then packed all the \"aslaha\", the other goods and their new clothes in the large sack. Everyone's sack, d containing the bombs and the goods, was kept for the night in the Lashkar-e- Toiba's car. Ismail asked all of them to keep their ID cards with Hindustani names in their pockets, and they did as instructed. 70. At night, Abu Hamza and Kafa told Ismail to note down the \"tul\" and \"chourai\" while on their way to Bombay so that they could reach Bombay with the help of GPS without difficulty. Ismail made the notes in his diary, as e instructed by them, in Kasab's presence. The journey to Mumbai by sea 71. On November 22, they woke at six (6) in the morning and offered namaz. Then they left for Karachi, along with Kafa and Abu Hamza, to make the \"fidayeen\" attack on Bombay. After walking for about thirty (30) minutes they reached a creek. Zaki-ur- Rehman Lakhvi was present there. He told them that the \"Aaqa\" (master) Hafiz Sayeed and all of them had worked very hard for that mission. Their efforts must bear fruit. They had been trained fully in every skill. They must not be let down. That was their responsibility. Zaki-ur-Rehman further told them to switch on the mobile phones on reaching Bombay. He said that the \"buddiyas\" targeting Nariman House, Taj Hotel and Oberoi Hotel would communicate with the media. They (Zaki-ur- Rehman and the other conspirators) would tell them afterwards what to say to them. They (Zaki-ur-Rehman and the other conspirators) would also send email to the media and challenge the Hindustani Government. Zaki-ur- Rehman then handed over to each \"buddy\" the maps sent by Sabauddin and Fahim. Ismail kept the map that showed the way to reach VTS and Malabar Hill.

Thereafter, Zaki-ur-Rehman prayed for them saying that he put them under the protection of Allah and Allah would protect them. He further prayed that Allah might let them complete the desired work fully. He then gave instruction to Ismail to take out the sea-valve before leaving the Hindustani boat so that it would sink into the sea. Zaki-ur-Rehman then took Ismail aside and talked to him privately. 72. At around seven (7 .00 a.m.) in the morning a small wooden boat arrived to take them. After sailing in that boat for an hour and a half, they were transferred to a bigger boat and the small boat went back. Hakim Saab and his three colleagues were also there in the big boat. At about 9.00 p.m. they boarded an even bigger vessel , Al-Hussaini, while Hakim Saab and his three colleagues returned in the second boat. There were seven (7) persons on the Al-Hussaini from before, of whom three were called Murshad (wanted Accused 16), Aaquib (wanted Accused 17) and Usman (wanted Accused 19). They were all members of Lashkar-e-Toiba. Murshad gave them the sacks containing the bombs, and the \"Kalashan\" that were packed in the Karachi House. Murshad also gave Ismail a rubber speed boat, a pump to fill air in the rubber boat, life jackets, blankets, rice, flour , oil, pickle, milk powder, matchboxes, detergent powder , tissue papers , bottles of Mountain Dew cold drink, dental cream, spray paint, towels, shaving kits, tooth brushes, etc. They spent that night on Al-Hussaini. [At this point the court time was over but Kasab's statement was incomplete. The Magistrate, therefore, sent him back to judicial custody. He was again produced before her on the following day, 21-2-2009, at 10.40 a.m. The Magistrate once again satisfied herself that he had been insulated from any external influence and would make the statement completely voluntarily. She then resumed taking down his statement.] 73. Continuing the narrative where he stopped on the previous day, Kasab said that on November 23, at about 12.00 p.m. they had travelled by Al-Hussaini for about half an hour (sic) when they saw a boat coming towards them. Usman waved a broken engine belt, indicating to the people on that boat that they were in need of help and, on the pretext of seeking their help in changing the broken belt, they approached that boat and captured it. The name of the Hindustani boat was \"Kuber\". Four persons on that boat were taken hostage by Hakim Saab and Usman and were brought aboard the Al-Hussaini. They also brought from the Kuber TV set and VCR and some other articles lying on it to the Al-Hussaini. Then all ten (10) fidayeens along with all their belongings boarded the Kuber. The \"Nakhva\" (navigator) of Kuber was also put in their custody. Then , on Hakim Saab's instructions, Ismail checked the amount of diesel on Kuber. The \"Nakhva\" told him that there were seven hundred (700) litres of diesel in its tank and another four ( 4) drums filled with diesel on board. Ismail asked him whether that would be sufficient to take them to Bombay to which he replied that that may not be sufficient to carry them to Bombay. Hakim Saab told Ismail that there might arise the need for more diesel, and asked his three colleagues to transfer the iron drums and plastic cans filled with diesel from Al-Hussaini to Kuber. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Thereafter, according to plan, they sailed for Bombay, with the help of GPS and the \"tul\" and \"chourai\" that were given to them, and with the assistance of Amarchand Solanki, the N akhva of Kuber. a 75. On Kuber, Imran Babar was assigned the work of cooking and the other nine (9) men were divided by Ismail in groups of three each for guard duty. Kasab was in the group with Ismail Khan and Nasir. Each group was given guard duty for two hours on rotation basis. Ismail also noted down in his diary the hours assigned to each group, mentioning the members of each group by the names given to them by Hafiz Sayeed. b 76. After sailing for some distance, they tied the \"Nakhva's\" hands, blindfolded him and made him sit near the engine. The three groups guarded the Kuber against any unfriendly intrusion round the clock and they also kept a watch on Amarchand, the \"Nakhva\". Ismail and Javed were sailing the boat with the help of the \"N akhva\". During the voyage they were talking to Abu Hamza on the satellite phone. And Ismail was verifying with the aid of GPS c that they were sailing in the right direction. They were also feeding the \"Nakhva\". They filled diesel in the engine of the Kuber thrice on the journey to Bombay, with help from the \"Nakhva\". 77. On November 26, at 11.00 a.m., according to plan, they tied red- yellow coloured threads around their wrists. Around 4.00 p.m. on that day d they neared Bombay and its tall buildings came within sight. Kasab shames the butcher 78. According to plan, Kasab called Abu Hamza on the satellite phone. He told him that they had reached Bombay and asked what was to be done with the \"N akhva\". Abu Hamza laughed and said he should do whatever he wanted. Kasab then told Ismail that it would be better to kill the \"N akhva\". e Ismail agreed with him. Kasab then asked Soheb and Nasir to hold the \"N akhva\" by the legs in the engine room. He himself yanked him by the hair and pulling his head down cut his neck. He then hid his body in the engine room. 79. Meanwhile, Ismail, Fahadullah, Javed and Nazir Ahmed began inflating the rubber speed-boat with the pump. After half an hour, when the boat was filled with air, it was lowered into the sea. They wore the new clothes purchased from the market in Karachi. Kasab put on a red T-shirt and, over it, a blue T-shirt with a cap attached to it and green cargo pants. Like him, the others also put on the new clothes purchased from the market in Karachi. They all put on red life jackets and yellow waterproof trousers. They left behind the clothes they had travelled in on the Kuber. Kasab left a white shal war and a white shirt that he had been wearing earlier. All of them offered namaz and then, according to plan, they all took out their mobile phones from the bags and switched them on. But there was no network on the sea.

They left the Kuber at a distance of about four (4) nautical miles from Bombay and sailed for Bombay on the speed-boat. Ismail was sailing the speed-boat. The speed-boat had the engine of Yamaha Company. Nazir Ahmed, with the aid of GPS, was showing the way to Bombay. On the way, Ismail said that first he and Kasab would leave for VTS by taxi, then Soheb and Nazir Ahmed would go to Leopold Hotel by taxi, and then Javed and Hafiz Arshad would go to the Taj Hotel by taxi. Imran Babar and Nasir would walk to Nariman House. Last of all, Fahadullah and Abdul Rehman (Chhota) would go to Oberoi Hotel in the speed-boat. Ismail asked Kasab, Soheb and Javed to place RDX bombs, according to plan, under their taxi drivers' seats. He told the others to place their bombs near the targets. 81. After sailing for about an hour and a half or two hours they reached the Bombay shore. According to plan, Abu Ali jumped out and anchored the boat to the shore. First, Ismail and Kasab alighted from the speed-boat. They took their bags. Both Ismail and Kasab removed their life jackets and waterproof trousers and threw them into the sea. After getting off the boat, Kasab put on his shoes. Following Kasab and Ismail, the others also got off the speed-boat. At that time it was about 9.00 p.m. and according to the plan they were late by about an hour-and-a-half. 82. On getting down from the boat they came across two persons.

Ismail and Kasab took their bags and walked up to the road. They took a taxi. Ismail sat in the front and Kasab sat in the back seat. Ismail asked the driver to take them to VTS. He started talking to the driver. Meanwhile Kasab fixed two nine (9) volt batteries to the wire of the timer in the bomb in the bag. He placed this bag, containing the bomb, under the driver's seat. He had set the time of explosion for after an hour and fifteen minutes. 84. They reached VTS within fifteen to twenty minutes and were annoyed to find the crowd at the station far less than what they had seen on the CD. Ismail tried to communicate with Abu Hamza on his mobile but the mobile did not show any network. Ismail then tried to make the call from Kasab's mobile but his mobile, too, did not work. Ismail kept Kasab's mobile with him and both of them entered and came inside the passage. They saw the stairs going upwards. The people there had come with large bags and from that they gathered that this platform was for long-distance trains. There was a toilet nearby. Kasab gave his bag to Ismail and went to the toilet. When he came back, Ismail went to the toilet carrying the small bag containing the bomb with him.

Then they saw a car with a yellow light coming towards them from the opposite direction. Seeing that car, both of them hid in the bushes, taking the cover of the wall behind them. As soon as that car came near them, they fired at it; at the same time shots were fired from the car, hitting Kasab on both his hands. When the firing from the car stopped they looked at the car and found that the persons inside the car were policemen and all of them were dead. They tried to open the car's rear door but it did not open. Kasab was injured and he stood leaning on the vehicle, shaking his hands, while Ismail fired a round of \"brush fire\" on the road behind the car. Ismail then went near the car and pulled out the dead bodies of the driver and the policeman sitting behind the driver. Kasab pulled out the dead body of the policeman sitting next to the driver and threw it on the ground. There were no rounds left in Ismail's \"Kalashan\" and, therefore, he picked up the policeman's \"Kalashan\" from the car. He started the car and drove at full speed. He told Kasab that bullets had hit him on the legs and in the armpits. 90. After some time they reached the chowk and found a large crowd comprising both policemen and the public. Ismail fired at the policemen and the public while continuing to drive the car. After some time it appeared that the back right tyre of their car was punctured. Ismail was, nevertheless, driving the car at a very high speed. Then, on seeing a white car approaching from the opposite direction, Ismail stopped their car. Kasab fired from his \"Kalashan\" in the air and both of them got out of the car. He went towards the white car and, pointing the \"Kalashan\" at the driver, asked him to stop the car. The driver immediately stopped the car. Ismail pulled him out. At the same time the person sitting next to the driver and the woman sitting on the back seat also got out. All this while, Kasab was giving cover to Ismail. Having thus snatched the car, Ismail sat on the driver's seat and Kasab quickly sat next to him and they left. At this point Kasab asked Ismail where they had to go. Ismail said they had to go to Malabar Hill. Kasab further asked where exactly in Malabar Hill. Ismail said he would tell him on reaching Malabar Hill. 91. After going for some distance, Kasab saw that they were travelling on a road going along the sea and then he realised that this road was shown in the map by Sabauddin and Fahim as going towards Malabar Hill. While they were driving at full speed, going in the direction of Malabar Hill, they saw the barricade on the road and policemen standing around the barricade. The policemen had seen their car moving at great speed from a long distance and were asking them to stop by raising their hands and blowing their whistles. Realising that it was impossible to cross the barricade by smashing against it, Kasab asked Ismail to stop the car at some distance from the ban·icade and to keep the headlights on so that the policemen would not be able to see either them or the number of their car. Ismail stopped the car at some distance from the barricade and kept the headlights on. The policemen were shouting at them and were asking them to switch off the headlights. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Looking around, Kasab saw that the road divider on his right was very low and thought they could cross it by driving the car at very high speed. He advised Ismail accordingly. Ismail immediately switched on the a water spray on the wind screen and started the wiper. He took the car a little ahead and turned it to the right in the direction of the road divider. He drove at full speed but the car did not go over the divider and stopped there. At the same time the policemen charged at them from both sides. Realising the gravity of the situation they both raised their hands. But the policemen kept coming at them. Seeing this Ismail tried to pick up the \"Kalashan\" but it was b kept below and he could not take it out. He then picked up his pistol, which was kept on the seat, and fired at the policemen. At the same time, Kasab saw a policeman coming towards him; he opened the door of the car and got hold of his \"Kalashan\". The police had started firing. A policeman tried to snatch the \"Kalashan\" from him. In the struggle, Kasab fell down but he had his finger on the trigger and he pressed it. The bullets hit a policeman holding a c rifle and he collapsed on the ground. The other policemen beat him with lathis and snatched the \"Kalashan\" from his hands. Ismail was injured in the police firing and he too was overpowered. 93. Kasab said that he and Ismail were then brought to the hospital in an ambulance. In the hospital he learnt that Ismail died by police bullets. He gave his and Ismail's names to the police and the doctors and also told them d that they were Pakistanis. 94. He concluded his statement before the Magistrate by saying that the doctors in the hospital cleaned and bandaged his wounds and got him admitted in the hospital. There the doctors took away his blood-smeared clothes and gave him hospital clothes to wear. When the police asked him about his colleagues and how they reached Bombay he told them everything. 95.

The inflatable rubber dinghy on which the terrorists came to Mumbai landed at a place called Badhwar Park. The dinghy's arrival at that particular place could not possibly be by accident or by chance. Badhwar Park was evidently selected as the landing site for the terrorists with great care and with consideration of its immense strategic potential for the attack on their g chosen targets. It is also clear that the selection of Badhwar Park as their landing place was not made by the attackers themselves but by someone else among the conspirators. The selection of the landing place for the dinghy was clearly based on a good deal of reconnaissance and survey work; and whoever selected the spot for landing had undoubtedly made himself fully familiar not only with the Mumbai shoreline but also the city. h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Badhwar Park is a settlement of fishermen and at that place the sea comes more deeply into the land mass, forming a kind of a vesicle. Hence, the water is calm and, this being a fishermen's colony, a group of young people arriving from the sea is not likely to arouse any suspicion or even attract much attention. Further, the place abuts a main road. A sandy slope from the water, not more than ten ( 10) metres in length, takes one to the road where taxis are readily available. The CST Railway Station is at a distance of 3.5 km from Badhwar Park and by a taxi it takes fifteen to twenty (15-20) minutes to reach there. The Taj Hotel is at distance of 1 km and Leopold Cafe nine hundred (900) metres. Nariman House, to which the two (2) terrorist went walking, is at a distance of 0.5 km. Nariman Point, where the last pair took the dinghy by sea after the other eight had alighted at Badhwar Park, is 0.55 nautical miles (1 km) from there; and from the point where the last pair got off the dinghy, Oberoi Hotel and Trident Hotel are at a distance of three hundred (300) metres. The last pair walked to these hotels. 98. Kasab had said to the Magistrate that on getting down from the boat they had come across two persons. They had enquired about them and even while Abu Ismail tried to rebuff them Kasab told them that they were students. One of these two men that Kasab met was Bharat Dattatray Tamore (PW 28). He lived in the Fisherman Colony, Cuffe Parade. He was a permanent employee of Hotel Taj Mahal, Colaba, where he worked as Mukhadam. He lived in Chawl No. 2 which was situated very close to the sea shore at about fifteen (15) minutes walking distance from the Taj Hotel. He deposed before the court that since his chawl was very close to the shore, for going anywhere he had to go along the shore quite close to the water. On 26-11-2008, he left his house at about 9.15 p.m. for the hotel, where his duties commenced at 10.00 p.m. and ended the following morning at 7.00 a.m. On the way to the hotel he saw an inflatable boat on the shore. In the boat there were ten ( 10) people who were in the age group of twenty to twenty-five (20-25) years. He saw eight out of them alighting from the boat. Each of them was carrying a sack and a handbag. Two of them proceeded towards the main road ahead of the others. They appeared strangers to the place and he asked them where they came from. One of them said they were students while the other responded by roughly asking in reply as to how he was concerned about them. He added that the two persons who had not alighted took the boat towards N ariman Point. He returned to his home next morning at about seven (7.00 a.m.). On the way he came across four (4) policemen near the Badhwar Park Railway Officers' Colony who were talking about the inflatable boat. He then told them what he had witnessed the previous evening. He later identified the appellant in the test identification parade held on 28-12-2008. He also identified the dead body of the other person at the mortuary of J .J. Hospital. He also identified the appellant while deposing in court, as one of the persons who had alighted from the boat. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

He was twenty-four (24) years old and a fisherman by profession. He stated before the court that he had a fishing boat and on 26-11-2008, at about 9.15 p.m. he, along with a few relatives, had gone out to sea on his boat to fish. On nearing Nariman Point around 9.45 p.m. they saw a seemingly abandoned rubber boat. There were some life jackets in the boat and it was fitted with a Yamaha engine. Buffeted by the sea waves, it was bouncing against the tetrapod. Lest the owner of the boat might suffer its loss they towed it to their fishing trawler and brought it to the jetty near the fishermen's colony at Badhwar Park (that is, to the point where it had first landed!). He informed the coast guard about the abandoned boat found by him. He further said that the police had arrived there and they took charge of the boat under a panchnama. We shall deal with the seizure of the boat by the police and the articles found in it in due course. Suffice here to note that the rubber boat (Article 156) was shown to the witness in court and he duly identified it as the one that he had found abandoned at Nariman Point and had towed back to the Fishermen's Colony, Badhwar Park. He also indicated the yellow strip of paint on the black body of the boat, on the basis of which he was able to identify it. 100. From Badhwar Park the appellant, Kasab, and his accomplice, Abu Ismail, took a taxi and proceeded to CST. Kasab told the Magistrate that he occupied the back seat of the taxi and, on the way to CST, had put the RDX bomb under the driver's seat, setting the time of blast for after an hour and fifteen minutes. We shall see the fate of the taxi, its driver and the passenger, who occupied it after Kasab and Abu Ismail, presently under the marginal heading \"The Vile Parle Blast\". But, for the present, the appellant and his \"buddy\" are on a spree of mass killings at CST. Slaughter at CST: Fifty-two (52) dead and one hundred and nine (109) injured a b C d e 101. In regard to the CST episode, like all other parts of the case, the prosecution has gathered a very large amount of evidence: ocular, forensic and of other kinds e.g. CCTV recordings. 5 They have documented practically every action and movement of the two killers from the point when Abu Ismail f threw the first hand-grenade 6 at the passengers on the platform till they went 5 To reconstruct the events at the CST the prosecution has examine fifty-three (53) witnesses. Leaving aside the forensic experts and other witnesses of a formal nature such as panch witness, the number of eyewitnesses who gave ocular accounts of the events is not less than twenty-five (25) . Out of these, ten (10) are policemen and members of Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Home Guard; among them three (3) are injured witnesses. Of the remaining fifteen (15), nine g (9) are passengers, of whom eight (8) are injured witnesses. Of the remaining six (6), four (4) are railway employees, of whom two (2) are injured. The remaining two (2) are photographers from the Times of India, one of the prime English dailies of the country. 6 According to the appellant's confessional statement before the Magistrate, before lobbing the hand-grenade at the crowd of passengers, Abu Ismail had placed the bag containing the RDX bomb, with the timer set for blast, among the passengers' luggage . Fortunately, however, the bomb failed to explode. The bomb along with the bag was later seized after it was diffused by h the bomb disposal squad, but that forms part of the forensic evidence to which we will advert to in due course. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On the basis of the ocular evidence alone (not taking into account for the rnornent the other evidences) the prosecution has presented before the court a vivid and photographic (figuratively and actually) account of the CST events. Here we propose to examine in slightly greater detail four witnesses whose evidence , in one way or another, has sorne special features , and then to take an overview of sorne rnore witnesses to construct a broad picture of the massacre at CST. 102. Before proceeding to examine the witnesses it rnay be appropriate to say a word about the way rnost of the witnesses identified the appellant. The appellant, Kasab, and his accomplice, Abu Ismail, seemed to rnak:e an odd pair in that Abu Ismail was quite tall, about six (6) ft in height, and Kasab is barely over five (5) ft. The difference in their height appears to have struck almost anyone who saw thern together. Although different witnesses described thern by their complexion (both Abu Ismail and Kasab are described as fair), age (Abu Ismail is said to be between 22 and 25 years and Kasab between 22 and 24 years), built of body (Abu Ismail as rnediurn built, Kasab as strongly built), their apparel and the bags they were carrying, almost everyone referred to their heights, calling Abu Ismail as \"the taller\" and Kasab as \"the shorter\" one. Many witnesses called thern \"lamboo\" (tall) and \"butka\" or \"tingu\" (short). Witnesses 103. Now the witnesses: Bharat Ramchandra Bhosale (PW 49) is the informant in connection with the offences cornrnitted at CST. At the tirne of the assault on CST he was an Assistant Inspector of Police attached to the CST Railway Police Station. The police station is situated within the premises of CST in the passage between the rnain hall of local lines and the rnain hall of rnain lines. On the night of November 26 and 27, he was on duty at the police station and he reported for duty at 2030 hrs. At about 2150 hrs, while he was corning out of the PS, he heard the sound of firing frorn the rnain hall of the rnain line railway station. The rnain hall is at a distance of about fifty to sixty (50-60) ft frorn the PS. He proceeded to the rnain hall frorn the side of the taxi stand (north). Police Inspector Shashank Shinde (one of the policemen killed in the attack), who was also on duty at that tirne, proceeded to the hall frorn the side of the SBI ATM (south). On corning to the rnain hall he saw the two terrorists indiscriminately firing frorn AK-47 rifles at the passengers sitting in the rnain hall. Many people were lying injured in pools of blood; rnany of thern were crying. Those who were still on their legs were trying to flee the rnain hall. Bhosale said that he first saw the two terrorists when they were firing frorn a spot near the public toilet. He described the location of the public toilet and went on to say that when he first saw the two terrorists they were in the rnain hall at a distance of about forty ( 40) ft. There was sufficient light in the rnain hall for hirn to see thern. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

He said that one of them was short, aged about twenty-two to twenty-four (22-24) years with long hair that came down to his neck; he had a fair a complexion and was strongly built. He was wearing a blue T-shirt and was carrying a Rexene bag. He was holding an AK-47 rifle. The other terrorist was taller than the first one. He was also fair and of medium built. He was aged about twenty-two to twenty-five (22-25) years. He was wearing a black T-shirt and he too was carrying a Rexene bag. He was also carrying an AK- 47 rifle. b 105. At this point, the witness paused in his narration to identify the appellant as one of the two terrorists who was described by him as short, strong built and who was wearing a blue T-shirt. 106. The witness was then shown the identity card recovered from Abu Ismail (Article 61) 7 . He identified the photograph as that of the other terrorist, the accomplice of the appellant. 107. The witness proceeded with his narration and said that he rushed back to the police station to ask for additional force. As he came near the entrance door of the police station he was fired at by the terrorists. One of the bullets pierced through his right upper arm and struck the wall near the table of the police station's House Officer. He intimated the railway police helpline about the assault by the terrorists and asked for additional force. 8 He also intimated the Commissioner of Police, Railways, on his walkie-talkie. 108. He then came back to the main hall accompanied by Police Constable Nalawade who had a carbine with him. He saw Police Inspector Shinde lying injured near the SBI ATM. Also lying injured in the main hall were about one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five (100-125) passengers. 109. By the time he came back to the main hall of the main lines, the two terrorists had moved in the direction of the main hall of the local railway station. Constable Nalawade fired three rounds towards them from his carbine. Constable Nardele (PW 58) also fired eight rounds at them from the main hall of the main lines while the terrorists were in the main hall of the local lines. The appellant and his associate were, however, not hit and they continued to proceed towards Platform No. 1 of the local lines. By then, the additional police force had come and the public had also come to their help. The injured persons were being taken to hospitals. The witness himself was admitted to St George's Hospital for treatment of the firearm injury in his right upper arm. 110. He later came to learn that Police Inspector Shinde and M.N. Chaudhary of RPF were also among those who were killed as a result of the firing by the two terrorists. He also learnt that the appellant and his associate had also used hand-grenades at the railway station. 7 The fake identity card with Hindu name given to each member of the group of terrorists by Abu Kafa befor e leaving for Mumbai. 8 Independently establi shed through mobile phone call records.

His statement was recorded at the hospital and on that basis a formal FIR was drawn up in regard to the CST episode. He identified his statement (Ext. 219) and the formal FIR (Ext. 220). 112. He further told the court that he had earlier identified the appellant in the test identification parade held at Arthur Road Prison on 28-12-2008. 113. In reply to a court question, Bhosale said that though he was carrying a 9 mm pistol, loaded with nine rounds, he did not fire at the terrorists because there was a strong risk of the passengers getting killed or injured by his firing. 114. Vishnu Dattaram Zende ( PW 65) is the railway announcer. His job is to make announcements of the arrival and departure of trains on a public address system. For that purpose he sits with his colleagues in a cabin on the mezzanine floor, almost at the centre of the main hall of the local lines, facing the full expanse of the main hall and beyond it up to Platforms Nos. 1 to 7 of the local lines. Perched in his office Zende had a completely unobstructed view through the glass screen of his cabin and he was able to see all that happening down below in the main hall and the local lines platforms on the fateful evening of 26-11-2008. Here it must also be noted that showing great devotion to duty and remarkable presence of mind Zende saved countless people from death or injury by constantly announcing on the public address system that the railway station was under terrorist assault and by advising passengers alighting from local trains that continued to arrive at the station while the attack was underway to not go towards the main hall but to exit through the rear side of the local lines platforms. 115. Deposing before the court, he began with a succinct description of CST from inside. He then proceeded to tell the court that on 26-11-2008, he was on duty from 3.00 p.m. to 11.00 p.m. At about 9.55 p.m. he heard a big explosion. He guessed that it was a bomb and looked outside the window of his cabin. He saw passengers from the main line hall running towards the local lines. Among them some were bleeding. Some were trying to rescue others who were unable to flee or move on account of injuries. 116. He further stated before the court that he saw two terrorists corning from the direction of Platform No. 7. He could see one of them from a distance of 15 to 20 ft as he came near the entry gate of Platform No. 4. The other was following him. Both were firing. At that point he suspended his announcements because the terrorists, from where they were at that time, could see him and fire at him. He then saw the shorter of the two terrorists sit down on the floor of the main hall, load his gun with a magazine, throw his bag in the hall and resume firing. 117. Zende added that, to avoid being shot at by the terrorists, he and his colleagues sat down on the floor of their cabin. Nonetheless, shots were fired in the direction of their cabin and one of the bullets smashed the glass pane and went right through, piercing the plywood partition at the back of the cabin. They continued sitting on the floor for about an hour-and-a-half. All the while they were in contact with their officers on the telephone. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

He then gave a description of the two terrorists and identified Kasab as the person who loaded his rifle sitting down on the floor of the main hall and who threw away his bag. He was then shown the identity card, a Article 61. He identified the photograph as that of the taller terrorist who was accompanying the appellant. He was shown a black haversack, Article 219. He identified it as the bag that the appellant had thrown away in the main hall of the local lines. 119. While dealing with the CST episode we must take note of the two other witnesses. Their evidence is extraordinary in that they did not only b witness the incidents but also made a visual record of the events by taking pictures of the two killers in action and also of their victims. The pictures taken by these two witnesses, without anything else, are sufficient to conclude the issue of identification of Kasab and Abu Ismail ( deceased Accused 1) as the killers of CST. Both the witnesses are professional photographers working with the Times of India group. Both of them, caring c little for their own safety and displaying exemplary professionalism, followed the killers practically at their heels. Their ocular testimony together with the photographs taken by them provides a graphic picture of the carnage at CST. 120. Sabastian Barnal D 'Souza ( PW 61) is one of the two photographer witnesses. He stated before the court that on the evening of 26-11-2008, he was in his office on the fourth floor of the Times of India Building, which d stands opposite the CST Railway Station. The main gate of the Times of India Building faces Platform No. 1 of the local railway station and one gate of CST Railway Station opens in front of the Times of India Building. At about 9.50 p.m. he came to know from one of his colleagues that a gunman had entered Taj Hotel and was firing there randomly. On this information, two photographers immediately proceeded to the Taj Hotel. D' Souza and his e colleague also came out of the office. As they came out of the main gate of the building, they heard the sound of firing at CST Railway Station. D' Souza jumped over the road divider and entered Platform No. 1 of the local railway station, carrying a Nikon digital camera. The railway station was deserted and there were no passengers on the platforms. A local train was standing on Platform No. 1. He crossed through the train and reached Platform No. 2. f There were no trains on Platforms Nos. 2 and 3. He proceeded to the main hall of the local railway station and walked up to the exit of Platform No. 6 in the main hall. There he found one policeman in uniform and another person accompanying him in plain clothes. They were looking towards the passage between the main line and the local line. It was at this point that he saw, at a distance of about one hundred (100) ft, in the passage between the main lines g and the local lines, two persons who were firing from guns held by them. They were near the booking window of local railway line in front of CST Police Station while he himself was at the exit of Platform No. 6 of the local line. At this juncture, one of the policemen9 fired at the two gunmen. h 9 As we shall see presently this was Assistant Sub-Inspector Sudama Aba Pandarkar (PW 62). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

At a nearby bookstall, the owner started to pull down the shutter and, as he was doing so, he was hit by a bullet and fell down. D'Souza took a picture of the fallen bookstall owner. 122. D'Souza then described the two gunmen and the way they were dressed. He identified the appellant in the dock as the shorter of the two gunmen. He added that both were carrying guns. 123. He further said to the court that he wanted to take photographs of the gunmen and, therefore, he entered one of the compartments of the train standing on Platform No. 6. The policeman in uniform and the other person accompanying him in plain clothes were still there. He thought the man in plain clothes was also a policeman. He saw the plain clothes man 10 taking the gun from the policeman in uniform and taking position to fire at the appellant and his companion. He took pictures of the policeman in uniform and the plain clothes man. He asked the two policemen to enter the train compartment because he thought they had taken a position that was quite dangerous. 124. He further said that since the gunmen were coming towards the local lines, he went to Platform No. 4. He told the court that during the course of the incident he took over one hundred (100) photographs but most of them were blurred. He was not using the flash-gun and the light was not good for taking photographs. In course of the deposition he was shown the photographs taken by him and he identified those photographs. 125. The photograph showing the bookstall owner felled by a bullet was marked Ext. 238. A set of three photographs showing the policeman in uniform and the plain clothes man taking aim with the rifle was marked collectively as Ext. 239. A set of three photographs of the appellant taken by D' Souza from behind a pillar was collectively marked as Ext. 240 11. A set of four photographs in which Kasab is shown with the other gunman Abu Ismail (deceased Accused 1) was marked collectively as Ext. 241. A photograph showing two persons lying dead or injured was marked Ext. 242 12. A set of 10 photographs taken by him after the gunmen had gone over to Platform No. 1 of the local lines, showing dead or wounded passengers lying in the main hall of the main lines, was collectively marked as Ext. 243. 126. He told the court that pictures taken by him were saved in the memory card of his camera. He had prepared a CD of the photographs from the memory card, to produce in court. The printouts were taken from the CD. 10 As we shall see presently this was Police Constable Ambadas Pawar (one of the policemen falling down to the tenorists' bullets). 11 All the three pictures clearly show Kasab, carrying a haversack on his back and an AK-47 in his hands . In the first picture he is shown moving forward, with the left hand raised and the right hand holding the AK-47 with the bairel pointing downwards.

Sriram Ramakant Vernekar (PW 102), the other photographer witness, works as a press photographer with the Times of India. He stated before the court that on 26-11-2008, he was in the office at the Times of India Building, opposite CST Railway Station. At about 10.00 p.m., on hearing the sound of firing, he picked up his camera and rushed towards CST Station. He approached the station from the subway gate. He saw two persons firing in the directions of the railway office and booking office. He took pictures of the two gunmen from near the entrance to the main hall from the subway porch. As they were moving in his direction, he got out of the station and, crossing the road divider, came on the side of the Times of India Building. 130. He told the court that he had seen the two gunmen in front of Platform No. 6 when he took their first photograph. He produced before the court four enlarged printouts of the photographs taken by him which were collectively marked, for the purpose of identification only, as Ext. 410. 131.

At the time of occurrence, they were on duty at different places in the vast premises of CST. On hearing the explosion and the gunshots and on seeing the passengers fleeing for their lives, they realised that a terrorist attack was underway at the railway station and proceeded from their respective stations towards the spot where the assault was launched. On the way, some of them came across each other. A few were lucky to escape unharmed and some survived even after receiving grave injuries to tell the story before the court; some others laid down their lives while trying to tackle the assailants either completely unarmed or carrying antiquated weapons that failed them at the most crucial moment. 135. Harshad Punju Patil (PW 59) was a Police Constable and on that date he was on patrolling duty in the ladies' compartment in the local trains. He was carrying a .303 rifle and ten (10) rounds. When the terrorists' attack took place, he was waiting for the train on which he was on duty near the Police Help Centre in the main hall of the local lines, in front of Platform No. 3. Soon after the firing started, Police Inspector Shashank Shinde of the CST Railway Police Station came there and told them that two terrorists were firing in the main hall of the main station. Police Constables Nardele and Gavit were also there. Both of them were carrying carbines. Shashank Shinde proceeded towards the main line station accompanied by N ardele and Gavit. Patil started loading the ten (10) rounds in his rifle. He then saw the two terrorists coming towards the local railway station from the main lines' side. 14 Ext. 410-D clearly shows Kasab coming down from the foot-overbridge. The picture was taken with a flash and, therefore, it shows Kasab both startled and angry with the haversack hanging from the shoulder and tl1e AK-47 held in both hands ready to fire. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

At that point, Jillu Baddu Yadav (PW 54), a Head Constable of the RPF, also arrived there, proceeding from his place of duty at the General Manager Gate of the CST Railway Station. He himself was unarmed but he saw Patil carrying a rifle with him. He saw one of the assailants sitting down on the floor of the main hall of the local station and loading his rifle with a magazine. Yadav asked Patil to fire at the terrorist. He b did not know that Patil's rifle bolt had jammed and it would not open. Thinking that Patil was trying to avoid firing at the terrorist, Yadav took the rifle from him and tried to fire at the terrorist who was sitting down on the station floor, loading the magazine into the rifle, but the rifle did not fire as it had locked. Meanwhile, the other terrorist also arrived at the spot and they fired in the direction ofYadav and Patil. He and Patil then took cover behind c a pillar from where he threw one plastic chair towards the two terrorists. In retaliation they again fired back towards them while proceeding in the direction of Platform No. 1 of the local railway station. 136.

He again tried to fire, but in the meanwhile his carbine was locked. He could not fire from it any longer. He then went to the armoury, got his carbine unlocked and loaded it with more rounds. But by the time he came back to the main hall of the local lines, the terrorists had already left the local railway station. 138.

Within a few minutes the explosion took place followed by firing, and he saw many passengers running wildly. In the meantime, Shashank Shinde came to the Police Help Centre. He told them that the railway station was under attack by the terrorists. Shinde asked Pandarkar to load his .303 rifle. Pandarkar accompanied Shinde towards the main line. He saw a terrorist who was about 6 ft in height coming from the side of the taxi stand and firing towards the railway police station. At that time he was standing in front of the railway police station. He fired two rounds at him from his .303 rifle but the shots did not hit him. At this point, Police Constable Ambadas Pawar, who was also accompanying Shinde, took the rifle from Pandarkar and fired one round at the terrorist. At the same time Pandarkar saw the other terrorist (the appellant) corning towards them from the side of Platform No. 8 (main line). He was shorter in height than the other terrorist. He was firing from his AK-47 rifle. Pandarkar, Constable Ambadas Pawar and PI Shinde went towards Platform No. 7 through Platform No. 6 and came near the ATM of Indian Bank. Both the terrorists started firing at them from AK-47 rifles. One of the bullets pierced through Pandarkar's left chest and exited from the back. He fell down as a result of the bullet injury.

On hearing the explosion and the gunshots she along with Shinde (killed), API Bhosale (PW 49), PSI Khandale and other policemen went towards the main hall of the main lines. She saw two te1Torists in the main hall and she saw the taller of the two throwing a hand-grenade at a crowd of passengers. The grenade exploded, causing injuries to a large number of passengers. Both the te1Torists were continuously firing from AK-47 rifles. She and Bhosale, therefore, proceeded towards the railway police station to call for additional force. While on way to the police station, Bhosale was hit by a bullet in his left upper arm and he fell down. She tied a handkerchief to his wound and helped him in getting back on his feet. At that time, she saw both the te1Torists proceeding in the direction of the local railway station. More than hundred (100) passengers lay badly injured in the main hall of the main lines. 147.

On descending from the foot-overbridge, they came to Badruddin Tayabji Marg, which is a long, meandering road, a part of which runs along the premises of Cama Hospital. Cama Hospital has large premises, on which there are a number of buildings including a six-storeyed structure called the New Hospital Building. The entry to Cama Hospital is from Mahapalika Road on its western side, and Badruddin Tayabji Marg runs along the back of its premises. The prosecution, with the aid of eleven (11) eyewitnesses, has traced practically every step taken by Kasab and Abu Ismail from the moment they came out of CST, entered Cama Hospital and eventually left the hospital. We, however, propose to examine only some of these steps, to get a broad idea of how the two were moving around killing people, completely mindlessly. 158.

Gupta bhel-vendor was also near the gate selling snacks of bhelpuri. At about 10.30 p.m. they saw two persons coming on to Badruddin Tayabji Road from the direction of the Times of India Building. One of them was \"lamboo\" (tall) and the other was \"butka\" (short). Both were carrying bags on their shoulders. Suddenly, they started firing. The butka man fired straight at them, and he shot Gupta bhelwala in full view of Waghela. Waghela was frightened and ran towards his hut. His friends also ran away from the spot. Back in his hut, Waghela told his mother about the incident. He shut the doors of his hut and peeped out from the little gap between the frame of the door and the panels. He saw the butka fellow standing near his brother's shanty, adjoining Waghela's own hut, and firing at it. He heard his brother cry out. He saw the lamboo fellow firing in the lane. After some time, he saw both of them going towards the gate of Cama Hospital. 159. After a while, Waghela went to his brother, Thakur Waghela's shanty. He found his brother lying in a pool of blood.

The tall man fired towards the window from where she was looking at them. One of the bullets hit the right wrist of a hospital servant, Hira J adhav. She was immediately removed to the casualty ward on the ground floor of the hospital. Kulathe further said that she informed the CMO on duty, Dr Archana, that two terrorists had entered the hospital building. She then rushed back to her ward and closed all the doors from inside. She also locked the ward's collapsible (iron grill) gate. Moreover, since the ward had windows on all sides, all twenty (20) patients who were in the ANC ward at that time were moved to the pantry for their safety. 163.

Another security guard, Baban U gade, was also there. As Funde was standing with U gade near the collapsible gate, he saw the appellant and one other person coming towards them. The appellant fired a shot at U gade from his rifle. The shot hit U gade in the abdomen and he fell down. Funde was scared and ran up the stairs to the fifth floor, where he took shelter in a ward, hiding behind a stand which is used for drying clothes. The appellant, however, followed him there and, putting the barrel of his rifle on his head, ordered him, \"Utho\" (get up). The appellant then asked Funde to proceed towards the bathroom. Funde saw one person lying in a pool of blood in front of the bathroom with a tall man standing near him. The appellant made him enter the bathroom where three (3) persons were already confined 21 . The bathroom was then bolted from outside. After two to three (2 or 3) hours, the police arrived there and opened the bathroom. Funde narrated the incident to the police. 166.

His encounter with the two terrorists has something uncanny about it. Fate seemed to force his every step towards meeting the terrorists and when he actually stood face-to-face with them, quite certain of death, he did not go down without fighting. Tough, two-and-a-half times the age of his opponents, completely unarmed and untrained in any kind of fighting, he put up a fight nonetheless. Unfortunately, his attempt could not succeed against an armed and trained killer. He was stabbed and shot and left behind by the terrorist in the belief that he was dead or would soon die. Shrivardhankar, however, survived to tell the story and to identify his assailant. 168. Shrivardhankar worked as a Senior Clerk at the Mantralaya at the time. Apparently a devotee of Hazrat Sayyed Shah Baba (a Muslim saint), after leaving his office at 6.00 p.m. on 26-11-2008, Shrivardhankar went to the Urs at the saint's Dargah (shrine), situated behind Metro Cinema. He left the Dargah at 10.30 p.m. and proceeded to CST via the Metro subway and St Xavier's College to catch a train home. On approaching the gate of Cama Hospital at Mahapalika Road, Shrivardhankar saw many people running in panic and learnt about the incident of firings at CST.

As soon as he reached the fifth floor, the luckless man found himself standing in front of a man holding a gun and a knife, and carrying a bag on his shoulder. He was about five feet six inches (5' 6\") tall and had short hair. He was wearing a jacket. He put his knife on Shrivardhankar's neck. b Shrivardhankar realised that the man would kill him in any case and, therefore, decided to fight. He tried to hit the man in the groin with his knee and also attempted to hit him with his bag. The bag, however, slipped out of Shrivardhankar's hand and the killer struck him two (2) times on the neck with his knife, causing bleeding. The killer caught hold of Shrivardhankar's collar and pushed him down. He inflicted a third knife-blow on his back and c also shot a bullet in his back.

The generator room is situated on the terrace of the building. At about 10.00 p.m., when he was on the terrace, Tikhe heard the sound of firing from the ground floor. On hearing the gunshots he immediately went inside the enclosure where the solar system is installed and locked its collapsible gate. He was still inside the enclosure when, around 11.00 p.m., the two terrorists arrived on the terrace. He saw them clearly in the light of the electric bulb of 200 watts that was lit on the terrace.

Therefore, Tikhe opened the gate and came out of the enclosure. The tall man was also holding a gun. Tikhe then identified the appellant as the short man who had pointed his gun at him. 174. When Tikhe came out of the enclosure, the appellant asked him the way out from the hospital. Tikhe told them that there was only one staircase that alone could be used to exit the hospital. The tall fell ow, who was keeping a watch, suddenly shouted \"Police!\" and started firing towards the stairs. The appellant held his gun against Tikhe's back and pushed him towards the stairs. The appellant and his tall partner brought Tikhe to the landing between the sixth floor and the terrace. From there, Tikhe saw three to four (3-4) policemen in front of the lift on the sixth floor. Tikhe raised his hands apprehending that he might be killed by the police if they suspected him of being a terrorist. A staff member of Cama Hospital, namely, Kailash (PW 111), was also with the policemen and he identified Tikhe to the police as one of the hospital staff. The police fired at the appellant and his tall partner forcing them to retreat to the terrace. In that time, Tikhe escaped and came down to the sixth floor landing. He told the police that there were two terrorists. 175. The appellant then started firing at them from above. He also threw a hand-grenade on to the sixth floor. The splinters from the hand-grenade hit Tikhe on his neck and he sustained a bleeding injury. Some policemen were also injured from the explosion of the hand-grenade. The appellant and his tall partner kept firing at the policemen. Tikhe saw a police officer and another policeman getting shot and falling down in front of the lift. After some time, the terrorists again threw down a hand-grenade and fired indiscriminately in the direction of the lift. The other policemen and the officers were also injured by the second explosion and the firing. 176. At this point, Tikhe came down to the second floor. He was accompanied by two policemen and by Kailash. One of these policemen went further down but the other stayed with them. After being given first aid they were shifted to GT Hospital. From there, Tikhe was taken to KEM Hospital for treatment as hand-grenade splinters were lodged in his neck. He was treated as an indoor patient for seven (7) days. 177.

On the way to CST he got information about the rnovernents of the terrorists and, in light of this information, he and his tearn reached Carna Hospital a little after 11.00 a p.rn. Date carne to learn that the terrorists had gone up to the terrace of Carna Hospital building and, therefore, he took the lift to the sixth floor landing, frorn where stairs led up to the terrace 23 . There, he had an encounter with the two terrorists who were at that tirne on the terrace of the building, holding Tikhe there. 179. On reaching the sixth floor, instead of rushing to the terrace, Date picked up an iron object lying there and threw it towards the door of the terrace, to check the position of the terrorists. In response, a burst of firing frorn an automatic weapon carne frorn the terrace door. Shortly thereafter, Date saw a bulky person (Tikhe) corning down to the landing on the stairs between the terrace and the 6th floor. Date challenged the bulky person but Kail ash (PW 111) identified hirn as a rnernber of the hospital staff. The bulky person indicated that there was somebody behind hirn. Date asked hirn to bend down and then fired over his head towards the terrace. That forced the terrorists to go back to the terrace. Taking advantage of the situation, Tikhe carne down to the sixth floor landing. In the rneantirne, a grenade was thrown frorn the terrace. It exploded on the sixth floor in front of the lift causing d injuries to sorne police officers, including Date, and also to Tikhe. b C 180. Date's tearn comprised seven (7) police officers and policemen. All of thern were armed with firearms. Date's Operator Tilekar and Police Constable Khandelkar had one carbine each. Date himself was wearing a bullet-proof jacket and he had a carbine with twenty (20) rounds. But all this did not prove sufficient to take out Kasab and Abu Ismail or even to stop e thern. The two terrorists were able to overcome the police and to escape frorn the tight spot in which they had landed - the terrace that had only one (1) exit by the stairs. This was because, besides having superior fire power, they had the great advantage of hand-grenades. Grenades exploding in the very small landing area badly injured the policemen who had no cover or shelter there. f 181. Date stated before the court that, after the first hand-grenade exploded, his officers continued to fire towards the terrace. But shortly afterwards, another hand-grenade was thrown, which caused injuries to almost all officers who were present there, including Date. The injured police officers, policemen and staff rnernbers of Carna Hospital were asked to go down. More (killed) could not go down because he was badly injured and g unconscious. Police Constable Khandelkar (killed) also could not go down as he, too, was badly injured.

Accordingly, they came to Metro junction where they came across Additional Police Commissioner Date (PW 118). a Date asked them to go back and collect bullet-proof jackets and arms and ammunition from Azad Maidan Police Station as information had arrived by then that the terrorists had reached the terrace of Cama Hospital building and were firing from there. As directed by Date, Kadam, Shelke (PW 141) and some others went back to Azad Maidan Police Station where they collected two bullet-proof jackets and some firearms and ammunitions. b 188. Returning to the scene of firing, they decided to go to the front gate of Cama Hospital (instead of going to the back side), expecting the terrorists to exit the hospital from its main gate. Kadam stated that he was accompanied by PI Thorawade (PW 128), PSI Shelke (PW 141), and Police Constables Utekar and Rathore. Constable Gawade was driving the Bolero vehicle (called Peter-12 7 Azad Maidan) in which they came there. The vehicle c was parked on the left side of the road facing Metro junction and they took position by the side of the vehicle. 189. At about 11.45 p.m., the policemen saw two persons corning out of Cama Hospital. Kadam first saw them on the footpath of Cama Hospital and Thorawade when they were near the gate of St Xavier's College adjoining the d hospital. Kadam said that one of them was \"lamboo\" (tall) and the other was \"butka\" (short). In the meantime, they saw a motorcycle driving on Mahapalika Road from Metro junction towards CST. It was driven by a police constable and a police officer was on its pillion. The officer got down near the gate of St Xavier's College and, according to Kadam, the motorcycle went ahead. (According to Thorawade, the constable made a U-turn and went e back towards Metro.) The officer who got down from the motorcycle started directing people coming from the direction of CST to return. He seemed to have asked the lamboo and the butka also not to proceed further but to go back. But they continued moving towards him and fired at him from a distance of about fifteen to twenty (15-20) ft. The officer collapsed to the ground. This confirmed to Thorawade and Kadam that the two persons who f had come out from Cama Hospital were the terrorists whom they had been watching for. Thorawade started firing at them from his service pistol. Kadam also fired one round from his pistol and then he stopped because Thorawade was firing at the terrorists. The terrorists fired back in retaliation. 190. Thorawade told the court that he tried sending messages to South Control from the wireless installed in his Bolero police vehicle but, due to g heavy traffic on the network, he was unable to send the message. Therefore, Thorawade went to the Metro junction where two to three (2-3) police vehicles were available.

After a short while, one police vehicle (Qualis) appeared from Badruddin Tayabji Road and took right turn on Mahapalika Road towards Metro junction. Thorawade saw the two terrorists in that vehicle. The person who was sitting on the right side was firing at the large crowd assembled at Metro junction. One policeman and another person were injured due to firing from that vehicle. 28 192. In the meanwhile, Kadam had remained in front of Cama Hospital. He went on to state before the court that he saw a white car with a red beacon approaching Mahapalika Road from Badruddin Tayabji Road but, immediately thereafter, he saw the car going backwards on Badruddin Tayabji Road. The lamboo and the butka fired at that car. One of them also threw a hand-grenade towards the white car. Thereafter, both of them proceeded towards Rang Bhavan Lane on (BT Road). The officer who was shot near the gate of St Xavier's College was later identified from the name plate on his uniform as Durgude. Kadam then identified Kasab in the dock as the butka who had fired at Durgude and who was accompanying the lamboo. Kadam further stated that he had earlier identified the appellant in the identification parade on 27-12-2008, and had also identified the dead body of the lamboo on 6-1-2009, at J.J.

Maruti Madhavrao Phad (PW 139) was the driver of the \"white car with red beacon\" which Kadam had seen coming from Badruddin Tayabji Road towards Mahapalika Road and then going in the reverse direction. It was actually a white Honda City car, a government vehicle allotted to one Bhushan Gagrani, IAS, Secretary, Medical Education and Drugs Department (PW 140). Phad was the driver on duty for the vehicle. On 26-11-2008, at 6.30 p.m. the car was, as usual, parked in the premises of \"High Rise Building\" situated on Badruddin Tayabji Road. Between 11.30 p.m. and 11.45 p.m., Phad received a call on his mobile from Gagrani, asking him to bring the car to his residence to take him to Mantralaya to attend an emergency meeting that seems to have been called as news broke of the terrorists' attack on Mumbai. As directed, Phad took the car from its parking place on Badruddin Tayabji Road and proceeded towards Mahapalika Road on his way to Gagrani's residence. As he approached Mahapalika Road, Phad saw two persons, one tall and the other short, firing on the road. He, therefore, stopped the car and began to reverse. At this, those two persons fired at his vehicle. Phad's right hand was on the steering wheel. Two bullets pierced the car's windscreen and hit him on his right hand. He continued to reverse the vehicle, ducking down to save himself from the volley of bullets, but a third bullet hit him on the left side of his waist. He also realised that the left front wheel of the car was punctured. He, therefore, locked all four doors of the car by means of the central locking switch and, pretending to be dead, lay down on the driver's seat. At this time, he heard an explosion near the car. 28 Abu Ismail was firing at the crowd assembled at the Metro junction while driving the Qualis h police vehicle which the two tenorists had snatched after killing all but one of its occupants.

After some time, he saw them from the rear windscreen of the car near the SBI office a behind him. His car was standing on the road in a slanting position but there was enough space on both sides for vehicles to pass. As the two terrorists approached \"High Rise Building\", they took cover behind bushes abutting that building. At the same time, Phad saw a police vehicle approaching his vehicle from behind i.e. from the side of the SBI office on Badruddin Tayabji Road. As soon as the police vehicle came close to the two persons hiding in b the bushes, they started firing indiscriminately at the police vehicle. At the same time, the shorter fellow seemed to have sustained a bullet injury, probably from the firing from the police vehicle. His gun fell down. The butka, however, picked up the gun and resumed firing at the police vehicle. 194. Firing from the police vehicle stopped, and the taller man went to the vehicle and opened its right front door, pulling the driver on to the road. c He also pulled down another person from the vehicle's middle seat. The butka fell ow went to the left side of the vehicle and pulled down the person sitting on the left front seat.

Phad stated before the court that he had witnessed the above incident from a distance of about one hundred and fifty (150) ft. The police vehicle thus taken over by the two terrorists proceeded towards Mahapalika Road. Apprehending danger from those two persons, Phad pretended to be dead and continued lying in his vehicle.

When the car did not come, he again called Phad but he did not turn up. Therefore, Gagrani went to Mantralaya in his personal vehicle. At about 12.15 a.m. he tried to contact Phad once again. This time, he got a response from the driver who told him that he had been fired at in the car; that the car was stranded in the vicinity of Rang Bhavan; and that he was lying injured inside it. Gagrani then tried to contact the Police Control Room but could not get through as the number was continuously engaged. He then contacted the Superintendent of GT Hospital and requested him to provide help to Phad. After an hour he was informed that Phad had been admitted to the hospital with bullet injuries. 200.

In cross-examination on behalf of the appellant, Jadhav stated that while proceeding on Badruddin Tayabji Road he had seen one white car with a red beacon. The exchange of fire between the occupants of the police vehicle and the terrorists had taken place in front of the ATM centre. He further stated that, at the time of the exchange of fire, his carbine was on single fire mode and he had no opportunity to put it on burst fire mode. Jadhav, Salaskar, Karkare and Kamate had fired at the terrorists in retaliation. The AK-47 held by the appellant had fallen down from Jadhav's firing. The appellant, however, picked up the gun and resumed firing at them. J adhav also said that while the Qualis was being driven by the terrorists, Yogesh Patil was lying on his knee.

The bullets pierced the middle seat and riddled the body of Yogesh Patil and he died as a result. Jadhav was not injured in that firing. Jadhav said that the appellant must have fired ten to fifteen (10-15) shots in that burst. He also stated that the lamboo had pulled Salaskar and the appellant had pulled Kamate out of the vehicle. Karkare was pulled out by the lamboo assisted by the appellant. While pulling him down from the vehicle the appellant had cursed him, using foul language, saying that he was wearing a bullet-proof Gacket).

Arasa and Ajgaonkar had a cornrnon friend Siddharth Umashankar (PW 238) who worked as Sales Manager in Oberoi Hotel. When the two terrorists, namely, Abdul Rehman (Chhota) and Fahadullah, entered Oberoi Hotel and started shooting there, Umashankar, along with other guests and staff members, escaped through the exit door in the lobby area. They went to Inox multiplex, which is a few minutes' walking distance from the Oberoi. When Ajgaonkar called him on the telephone, Umashankar asked him to come to Inox and take him away from there. Ajgaonkar contacted Arasa and asked him to come with his car so that they could go to Inox to fetch 30 For this part of the case the prosecution examined six (6) witnesses.

From Mahim they proceeded to Inox with Arasa driving, Ajgaonkar occupying the front a left seat and his wife Megha sitting in the back. They were going to rescue Umashankar but they themselves had a brush with death when they came across the two terrorists face-to-face. 213. They reached Rajani Patel Road, Nariman Point, at about 0015 hrs on 27-11-2008. They saw a Qualis police vehicle approaching them from the opposite direction. When the Qualis was about sixty (60) ft away, someone b from the police vehicle shouted at them to stop. Simultaneously, a shot was fired in the air from that vehicle. The Qualis stopped and two persons got down from it and approached their car. The person who had got out from the left side of the police vehicle came in front of their car. He asked Arasa to get out of the vehicle. The other person, who had been driving the Qualis, pulled Arasa out of the Skoda car, holding him by his collar. In the meantime, Samit c and Megha had already left the car and were sitting on the footpath. As Arasa got out of the car, he realised that he was carrying the key. He, therefore, immediately threw the key away. 214. The person who had come out of the Qualis from the left side was shorter than the other person. Arasa identified the appellant in court as the same short person who had come to him and asked for the car's key. When d Arasa had thrown away the key, it had landed near the car's rear right wheel. Arasa picked up the key and gave it to the appellant. The two men drove away in the car: the appellant sat in the front left seat and his partner drove the car. 215. Let us now see the description of the occurrence by Ajgaonkar. He stated in his deposition before the court that, when the Qualis stopped, two persons got down from it and approached their car. One of them was taller and the other was shorter. He identified the appellant as the shorter person who approached their car along with his associate who was taller than him. The taller man approached Arasa while the appellant stood in front of the car. The appellant ordered them to get out of the car (\"Gadi se bahar aao\"). The taller fellow pulled Arasa out by his collar. In the meantime, Ajgaonkar and his wife got down from the car and went to the footpath on the left side of the car. The taller fellow occupied the driver's seat and the appellant sat on the front left seat. The taller fellow, however, could not find the car keys and, hence, the appellant got down from the car and demanded the key from Arasa. Arasa picked up the key which he had thrown near the car and gave it to the appellant. Thereafter, both of them drove away in the Skoda car. The terrorists proceeded towards Inox theatre. 216. Arasa further told the court that, at about 3.00 p.m. on 27-11-2008, he received a phone call from PSI Zende (PW 148) of Marine Drive Police Station, asking him to come to the police station. Accordingly, he went and reached there at about 3.45 p.m. He was taken to the spot from where the car was taken from him.

He told the court that the car was in proper condition when it was snatched away from his custody. 218. As seen above, both Arasa and Ajgaonkar identified the appellant in court. Both said that they had earlier identified him in the test identification parade. Arasa was one of the witnesses in the test identification parade held on 28-12-2008, and Ajgaonkar on 14-1-2009. Both had identified him in a group of seven (7) persons of similar height and built. The identification was made in the presence of the SEO and two panchas. Vinoli Chowpaty 31: one dead, one injured 219. Kasab and Abu Ismail along with eight (8) others (the dead accused) were seen landing on the shore of Mumbai on 26-11-2008, between 9.15 and 9.30 p.m. Kasab and Abu Ismail snatched the Skoda car near Vidhan Sabha around 12.15 a.m. on November 27. They came to Mumbai armed to the teeth; they had the great advantage of complete surprise and were also aided by a lot of luck. They were thus able to have a free run for over three (3) hours, killing innocent people and policemen at will. However, their run would soon come to end as a team of policemen were waiting, determined to stop them, caring little for their own lives. Abu Ismail was killed in their last encounter with a police team, but Kasab was taken alive in custody. 220. We propose to examine here three (3) witnesses who were members of the police team that stopped Kasab and Abu Ismail travelling in the stolen Skoda car and took them in custody. 221. Bhaskar Dattatray Kadam (PW 1) was a Sub-Inspector of Police attached to DB Marg Police Station. On 26-11-2008, at about 2200 hrs, Senior Police Inspector Nagappa Mali told him that terrorists had attacked some parts of South Mumbai and directed him to go to Girgaon (Vinoli) Chowpaty along with members of the Crime Detection Branch and to do a nakabandi there by putting up barricades. As directed by Mali, Kadam proceeded to Vinoli Chowpaty accompanied by six ( 6) members of the Detection Branch. On reaching there, he found API Hemant Bavthankar (PW 3), Peter Mobile Operator Sanjay Patil, Peter Mobile Driver Chandrakant Kamble, Girgaon Chowpaty Beat Incharge ASI Pawar, ASI Koch ale, Head Constable Chavan, PN Naik and some other policemen already present there and barricades already put up.

The police team was receiving messages regularly through wireless a on the Peter Mobile Van. They received a message that two terrorists were proceeding towards Chowpaty from Vidhan Bhawan via Marine Drive in a Skoda car. At about 0030 hrs they spotted a Skoda car on Marine Drive coming from South Bombay towards Chowpaty. Having been alerted in regard to the Skoda, all the policemen, including Kadam, signalled to the driver to stop the car. The car stopped at a distance of about fifty (50) ft from b the barricades. The police team shouted to tell the driver that there was a nakabandi and they would check the car. They asked the driver to put off the headlights and to put on the inside lights of the car. Instead of following these directions, the driver of the car did just the opposite. Not only were the headlights kept on but the wipers and the water spray on the windscreen were C also switched on. Therefore, it became difficult to see anything inside the car. Then, in a bid to escape, the driver tried to take a U-turn just before the barricades. However, the car could not climb over the road divider; it dashed against it and stopped . Kadam and six (6) other policemen rushed towards the car and surrounded it. The driver and the other person who was sitting on the front left seat raised their hands pretending surrender but, when Kadam d approached the driver, he started firing at him through the lowered window. Kadam fired back from his service revolver. At that time Kadam was about ten to twelve (10-12) ft from the driver of the car. Kadam told the court that he shot the driver of the Skoda car and injured him. 223. The other occupant of the Skoda car, who was sitting on the front left seat, opened the door on his side and got out of the car. While getting out, e he deliberately fell on the road. ASI Tukaram Omble and API Sanjay Govilkar were proceeding towards the car's front left door. The person who had got out of the car from the front left door started firing at Tukaram Omble with an AK-4 7 rifle. Even as he was being fired at, Tukaram Omble threw himself bodily upon his assailant. Tukaram Omble and Govilkar were injured by shots from the AK-47 rifle. Other members of Omble's and f Govilkar's team started hitting the assailant with lathis. They succeeded in disarming him. His AK-47 rifle was snatched away from him by policemen and he was taken into custody. 224. Within ten (10) minutes of this occurrence, Senior Police Inspector Mali, PI Sawant (PW 31), PI Surulkar, API Yadav, API Gawade (PW 4), PSI g Gaikwad (PW 24) and PSI Warang (PW 27) reached the spot. Two (2) ambulances also reached there within the same time. 225. Omble and Govilkar, who had sustained injuries, were sent to hospital in the Peter Mobile Van.

He was unconscious at that time as he was injured by the bullets. It needs to be clarified here that Article 12, the AK-47 rifle which was identified by Kadam (PW 1), Govilkar (PW 2) and Bavthankar (PW 3) as having been recovered from the leg space below the driver's seat of the Skoda car actually belonged to the slain police officer Ashok Kamte, Additional Police Commissioner. Abu Ismail evidently picked it up while switching from the Qualis to the Skoda, leaving his own AK-47 rifle in the damaged Qualis. 251. Arun Balkrishna Jande (PW 7) who was working at Naigaon Police Armoury at the relevant time deposed before the court that Article 12, the AK-4 7 rifle and the magazine were issued to Ashok Kamte, Additional Commissioner of Police on 4-8-2008. He identified Article 12, the AK-47 rifle from the number on its butt (94) and the body (LY8860) on the basis of the entry (Ext. 76) made in the register maintained in the armoury. The empty magazine with it also bore the same number. 252. On the other hand the AK-47 rifle along with a magazine (labelled Articles 427 and 428 respectively) that was recovered from the damaged Qualis police vehicle under seizure panchnama (Ext. 529) belonged to Abu Ismail and he had carried it with him from Pakistan. This becomes clear from the ballistic analysis of the bullets recovered from dead bodies which shows that one Ashrafali, who was killed at CST and Ashok Kamte, who was killed in the Qualis police vehicle were hit by bullets fired from the AK-47 rifle, Article 427. This is also in conformity with what the appellant stated in his confession before the Magistrate that as they left the Qualis police vehicle, Abu Ismail left behind his AK-4 7, the magazines of which had emptied by then and picked up the AK-47 of one of the officers lying dead in the vehicle. Vile Parle blast: Two dead, three injured 253. Before concluding the narration of crimes directly committed by Kasab in the company of Abu Ismail, we must take note of another event. A taxi bearing Registration No. MH 01 G 7792 was blown up by a bomb blast on western express highway, Vile Parle (East), near Swan City Club at slightly after 10.45 p.m. on 26-11-2008. The explosion destroyed the vehicle and instantly killed its two occupants (the driver and a passenger). 254. The explosion was witnessed by Shyamsunder Rambharat Choudhary ( PW 171 ), Balkrushna Ramchandra Bare ( PW 490) and Sheldon Alman (PW 491). As a result of the explosion, Choudhary suffered a bleeding injury on his right shoulder, Bare sustained injuries on his face below the eyelid, and on the forehead, nose and ear, and Alman on his left hand. Choudhary and Bare were admitted as indoor patients and treated at Cooper Hospital, and Alman at Holy Spirit Hospital. 32 According to the post-mortem of Abu Ismai (Ext. 97) there were six (6) bullet wounds on his person; among the other parts of the body, he was hit on the right eye and on the rear side of head, the front portion of the arm of the right hand shoulder and also at a distance of seven (7) cm down from the right hand shoulder. It would thus appear that he was hit by shots fired by both, Kadam and Bavthankar. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The two occupants of the taxi i.e. the driver and the passenger, who lost their lives in the explosion, were Umar Shaikh and Laxminarayan Goyal3 3 respectively. a 256. In the narration of this painful and gory tale, one comes across brntal and mindless killings at every step but there are some killings, like the present one, that stand out as especially sorrowful. Shaikh was a taxi driver eking out a livelihood by plying a taxi of which he was not even the owner, and Goyal was a lawyer from Hyderabad who had come to Mumbai in connection with some professional work. The only fault of the taxi driver was b that he was hired by the two messengers of death to carry them from Badhwar Park to CST and of the passenger that on that chaotic night in Mumbai, when death seemed to be lurking around every corner, he had thought that a taxi would be a safer mode of transport than the local trains. 257. As noted above, Goyal had come to Mumbai in connection with some professional work and he was due to go back to Hyderabad by a train c leaving CST in the evening of 26-11-2008. He reached CST but missed the train. His sister-in-law Usha Sharad Chaudhary (PW 168) lived in Mumbai at Charkop, Kandivali (W). Goyal called her from his mobile 34 phone to tell her that there was some incident of firings at CST and he had missed his train and he was coming back to her place. On account of the city being under tenorist attack, she asked him not to travel by any local train but to take a d taxi. After five (5) minutes, he called her again to tell her that he had boarded a taxi and left C ST. 258. Usha Sharad Chaudhary was quite anxious and called Goyal from her mobile phone again at about 10.30 p.m. He told her that he had reached Dadar. At about 11.45 p.m., Usha Sharad Chaudhary received a phone call from Goyal's daughter Diksha, who stayed at Walkeshwar, Mumbai, saying that she had last spoken to her father at about 10.45 p.m. and thereafter her father's phone was not reachable. That was the last anyone spoke to or heard from Goyal. His mutilated body was later found at Cooper Hospital. 259. Umar Sheikh, too, while carrying Goyal in his taxi, was called by his friend Irshad Ahmed Shaikh (PW 169) on his mobile at about 10.00 p.m. on 26-11-2008. Irshad had given his driving licence for renewal to Umar (the deceased) and he was enquiring whether it had been renewed. Umar told him that the friend to whom he had given the licence for renewal had not brought it back and added that in view of all the disturbances in the city it was good that he (Irshad Ahmed Shaikh) would not be driving on that night. At this Irshad, asked him why, in that case, was he proceeding to Kandivali with a passenger in his taxi? Umar told him that it was only because the passenger seemed to be in trouble and he had made a very earnest request to take him to Kandivali by any means. In the morning of 27-11-2008, Irshad Shaikh learnt from TV news that there had been a bomb blast in a taxi at Vile Parle. He and some friends went in search of Umar Shaikh and found his dead body at Coroner's Court at Cooper Hospital. 33 Their identity was established by DNA profiling of the remains of the bodies found in the destroyed taxi. 34 All calls established through mobile call records. e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The above is a broad account of the havoc wrought by Kasab and Abu Ismail over a period of slightly more than three (3) hours, beginning with their arrival at Badhwar Park and ending with their being apprehended at Vinoli Chowpaty. It must, however, be made clear that the above account is based only on part of the ocular evidence led by the prosecution before the trial court. Besides the depositions referred to above, the prosecution has an enormous volume of other evidence such as: articles recovered and seized from places through which the two terrorists passed, and the places where they stopped; the vehicles they used until they were finally caught; medical and forensic reports, CCTV recordings, phone call records, station diary entries, police logs, etc. We see no reason, however, to refer to all that evidence since, on the basis of the ocular evidence discussed above alone, we have no doubt that the appellant, personally and jointly with Abu Ismail, is directly responsible for killing at least seventy-two (72) people 35 and causing injuries of various kinds to one hundred and thirty (130) people 36 . 261. All the witnesses discussed above ( except those relating to the Vile Parle and Mazgaon taxi blasts) had a life and death encounter with the appellant and his associate, Abu Ismail (deceased Accused 1), at close quarters. The physical appearance of the two terrorists was etched on their minds. All the witnesses gave a detailed description of the two terrorists to the court. They described them by their complexion, age, body-built and height, stating that one of them was tall and the other was short. All of them identified the appellant in court as the shorter of the two assailants. They also identified Abu Ismail from the photograph on the fake identity card, Article 61. They also stated before the court that they had identified the appellant in the test identification parades held. We accept their testimony without any hesitation. 262. From the forensic evidence it further appears that of the seventy-two (72) dead, at least six (6) persons fell to shots fired by the appellant. 37 We, therefore, see no difficulty whatsoever in holding him guilty of multiple murder, murder with common intention and abetment, attempt to murder with common intention and abetment, abducting in order to murder, robbery with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt, and several other allied offences under the Penal Code (IPC), committing terrorist act punishable under Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, as well as 35 One (1) the \"Nakhva•• on the Kuber; fifty-two (52) at CST; seven (7) , \"Cama In\"; nine (9), \"Cama Out\"; one (1) at Vinoli Chowpaty; and two (2) in the Vile Parle taxi blast. 36 One hundred and nine (109) at CST; ten (10), \"Cama in \" ; seven (7), \"Cama out \" ; one (1) at Vinoli Chowpaty; and three (3) at Vile Parle taxi blast. 37 From the ballistic analysis of the AK-47 bullets recovered from dead bodies, (only such that were not fragmented and were capable of identification), it came to be established that at least six (6) persons , namely , Sitaram Sakhare , Rahamtulla Ibrahim , Vinod Madanlal Gupta , Ambadas Ramchanclra Pawar, Abbas Rajab Ansari (at CST) and Tukaram Gopal Omble (at Vinoli Chowpaty) were hit by shots from the AK-47 rifle, Article 10, held by the appellant. Ashok Kamte, according to the forensic evidence , was hit by shots fired from Article 427, the AK-47 rifle used by Abu Ismail. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Nothing will please Mr Raju Ramachandran, Senior Counsel a appearing for the appellant, more than stopping at this stage. As a matter of fact, he made a fervent plea to segregate the case of the appellant from the other eight (8) dead accused. He urged that, for the purpose of this appeal, the Court need not go into the offences committed by the eight (8) other dead terrorists who, though, arrived together with the appellant and Abu Ismail at Badhwar park, but went their separate ways from there. The learned counsel b submitted that the appellant's culpability should be judged, and the commensurate punishment for him should be determined only on the basis of the offences directly attributable to him. In other words, he would like to confine the case only to acts committed by the appellant along with the dead Abu Ismail from the time the two landed at Badhwar Park until they were caught at Vinoli Chowpaty. c 264. Mr Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the State of Maharashtra, was quite shocked by the suggestion made by Mr Ramachandran. Mr Subramanium submitted that stopping at this stage of the case would amount to shutting out the prosecution unheard. The learned counsel submitted that the offences committed by the appellant in the company of the dead Abu Ismail can never be properly appreciated in d isolation. The appellant and his companion, the dead Abu Ismail, were part of a close-knit team of ten (10) terrorists who arrived together on the soil of Mumbai in a highly organised way and attacked their various targets in furtherance of a common conspiracy. The learned counsel submitted that the full magnitude of the case would only be clear as the prosecution unfolds the evidence relating to conspiracy. He submitted that, as the evidence relating to e the other aspects of the case and the five (5) other venues of violence is set out before the court, it would become clear that a much larger and ominous conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan, the aim of which was to destabilise the country and to wage war against the Government of India. It would also be clear that all ten ( 10) terrorists, including Kasab and Abu Ismail, who spread out from Badhwar Park in pairs, were acting in concert and in execution of f the larger conspiracy. Seen thus, the appellant would appear equally culpable for the carnage and other offences committed by the other terrorists of the team at different places, though admittedly he was not physically present at the venues of those crimes. Mr Subramanium submitted that the course suggested by Mr Ramachandran would do grave injustice to the prosecution, nay, to the people of the country who came under a completely unprovoked g attack and suffered a war waged against them that was encouraged, monitored, and guided from minute to minute from a command post based in a foreign land. 265. We are of the view that Mr Subramanium is clearly right. The suggestion made by Mr Ramachandran that the appellant should only be held liable for acts committed by him in the company of Abu Ismail is based on h the premise that the appellant and Abu Ismail were acting independently and ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 107 separately from the other terrorists who, on arriving at Mumbai, went to four different targets. It is contended that though all ten (10) terrorists arrived in Mumbai together, on the same inflatable rubber dinghy, each of the five pairs into which they divided themselves must be held liable for the actions of the pair alone and not for what the other four pairs might have done, because each pair went in a different direction from the landing site. The underlying assumption is that the five pairs were not connected to each other by a common conspiracy and that they were not acting in furtherance of a conspiracy that was keeping them bound together even after they had separated physically in order to execute their assigned roles under the conspiracy. We find no basis for such an assumption, even in light of the prosecution evidence discussed so far. Further, it would be wrong to proceed on such an assumption even without taking into account the evidence of conspiracy that the prosecution has to present with reference to the other aspects of the case and the other venues of the terrorist attack. 266. We, therefore, deem it necessary to proceed with the matter further and to examine the other venues of carnage. But we propose to scrutinise the other aspects of the case and visit the other four places of terrorist violence primarily with the view to see what the prosecution has to offer by way of evidence of conspiracy and in support of the various other charges against the appellant. We do not propose to discuss the evidence relating to the offences committed by the other eight (8) dead terrorists at those places in any great detail for the simple reason that, being dead, they were not on trial. 267. After landing at Badhwar Park, the appellant and Abu Ismail, the leader of the group (deceased Accused 1), went to CST by a taxi. At the railway station they killed as many people as they could and then left via the foot-overbridge to Badruddin Tayabji Marg. They overcame any efforts by the police to stop them on the sixth floor of the Cama Hospital building, at the main front gate of the hospital and on Badruddin Tayabji Marg near Rang Bhavan Lane. In the process, they killed, among many others, three (3) senior police officers and grabbed the Qualis vehicle in which they were trying to intercept the two terrorists. They were unable to go very far in the Qualis as one of its wheels was destroyed in the gunfire. They then commandeered another vehicle, a Skoda, from its occupants at gun-point. They were driving the Skoda on Marine Drive when they were finally caught at Vinoli Chowpaty. 268. The road on which they were travelling goes to Malabar Hill and their car was headed in that direction. In his statement before the Magistrate, the appellant had said that as they sat in the Skoda after seizing it from its occupants he had asked Abu Ismail where they had to go. Abu Ismail said that they had to go to Malabar Hill. The appellant further asked where exactly in Malabar Hill, but Abu Ismail said that he would tell him on reaching Malabar Hill. There is no other evidence that their destination was actually Malabar Hill. It is also not clear as to where exactly they intended to go once they reached Malabar Hill or who was/were their target(s) there.

Later he also named them and referred to their respective roles in his confessional statement before the Magistrate.

Next, they proceeded to the sixth floor where they took Kuttalam Rajgopalan Ramamoorthy (PW 184) into captivity.

Ramamoorthy first said that he was a teacher at which the tenorists mocked him, saying how could he stay at the Taj on a salary of rupees twenty thousand a month . They sarcastically asked him whether he was a smuggler and whether he was teaching his pupils how to kill Muslims. Ramamoorthy finally disclosed his true identity. Before he was able to escape, Ramamoorthy had a most harrowing time with his captors, and one may appreciate his plight by recalling a few verses from a contemporary poem reflecting the feelings of a person taken as one of the hostages by the tenorists: \"I feel entrapped Just like you do. You by your acts and I by you. You target me yet you are blind product of an imprisoned mind. Your freedom comes with your last breath for me, when I escape from death.

They then entered the upper floors of Nariman House without difficulty. Nariman House is a six (6) storeyed (ground plus five) building. It is a residential-cum-prayer house used by Israeli people for temporary accommodation. An Israeli priest called Gabriel Holtzberge lived there permanently with his wife Rivka and their two (2) year old son Moshe. They had two (2) employees. One was Kazi Zakir Hussain ( PW 239 ), who was provided accommodation on the ground floor, and the other was a woman called Sandra. Besides these two, they had a watchman called Kesari who, however, was not present at the time of the occurrence on 26-11-2008. 278. On the date of the occurrence there were four guests, two males and two females, staying with the Holtzberge couple at Nariman House. 279. The dinner, on 26-11-2008, was over by 8.00 p.m. and by 9.45 p.m. Hussain was going down to his accommodation after he and Sandra had finished their day's work. On the stairs he saw a person armed with a gun standing on the landing area between the first and second floors. The gunman fired a shot at Hussain but he was not hit. Hussain immediately returned to the first floor where Sandra was still in the hall. On entering the first floor hall, Hussain shut the door from inside. Gabriel, Rivka and their four guests were at that time on the second floor. Hussain and Sandra hid themselves in the store room, bolting the door from inside and putting off the lights. They came out of the store room at 11.00 a.m. on 27-11-2008. All through the night and in the morning there had been sounds of gunshots being fired from inside the building. While they were trying to get out of the building, they heard the child Moshe crying on the second floor. They went up and found Moshe on the second floor hall. Sandra picked up the boy and brought him out with them. On coming out of Nariman House they were immediately taken to Colaba Police Station. 45 280. It was their exemplary courage, humanity and loyalty to their employers that saved the child Moshe from certain death at the hands of the two terrorists. 281. The Nariman House episode indeed presents a shining example of good and proper human conduct in the face of grave personal danger, but there were also many tragic killings of innocent people at Nariman House . The two terrorists took Gabriel, Rivka and their guests as hostages. They first tried to use them as bargaining chips to start some sort of negotiation with the Indian authorities but, when they were unable to start any negotiation and as they came under the heat of the security forces' operation, they simply killed all their hostages as being expendable baggage and encumbrances in their fight against the security forces. 44 Both the bombs planted by the terrorist s exploded causing considerable damage; see Rambuval Chandrapati Yadav (PW 202). 45 See the evid ence of Kazi Zakir Hussain (PW 239). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Mohammad Salim Harharwala ( PW 206) lived along with his a family at 73/4, Faridun Court Building, SBS Road, Colaba, which is very close to N ariman House. Apprehending danger and feeling insecure at Faridun Court because of the incident of firings in Nariman House, he shifted with his family to a flat on the fourth floor of Colaba Court, which is situated in front of Nariman House. This, unfortunately, turned out to be a fatal decision. In the Colaba flat, he and his parents were standing near a window b facing Nariman House when, at about 10.30 p.m., his parents were hit by bullets fired directly from Nariman House. They were taken to St George's Hospital where they were declared dead. 284. From N ariman House the terrorists made random firings in all directions and threw hand-grenades at adjoining buildings, roads and lanes c that resulted in many injuries. 285. There is another aspect of the N ariman House episode to which we shall advert in greater detail in the latter part of the judgment. From N ariman House the two terrorists, Imran Babar in particular, were in regular contact on the mobile phone with their handlers and corroborators across the border. At one stage, the controllers even tried to use one of their hostages, Norma d Shvarzblat Robinovich (a Mexican citizen, later killed), as an intermediary in an attempt to start some sort of \"negotiation\" with the Indian authorities. The collaborators tried to tutor her as to what she should speak to the Indian authorities on the telephone. She was told not to disclose her own position or the position of her captors inside the house and further not to disclose the number of hostages taken by them but to persuade the Indian authorities to e stop the operation by the security forces and to negotiate with her captors in order to save the lives of the hostages. 286. Apart from the collaborators and handlers, Imran Babar also engaged in dialogues with India TV, a popular news channel in the country, and with one Levi from the US who apparently intervened as a self-styled f mediator to try and save the lives of the Jewish hostages. 287. The two terrorists holed up in Nariman House, Imran Babar alias Abu Aqsa and Nasir alias Abu Umar, were finally killed by security forces in the night of 28-11-2008. But, by then, they had been able to kill nine (9) people [of whom five (5) were foreign nationals] and injure seven (7) people. Hotel Oberoi: thirty-five (35) dead, twenty-four (24) injured 288. Fahadullah ( deceased Accused 7) and Abdul Rahman \"Chhota\" alias Saqib (deceased Accused 6) entered Hotel Oberoi at about 2155 hrs on 26-11-2008 and started burst firing in the hotel lobby.

The hotel staff in Kandhar Restaurant, situated on the mezzanine floor, heard and saw them firing in Tiffin Restaurant. At that time there were fifty to sixty (50-60) guests in Kandhar Restaurant. The staff members closed the door of Kandhar Restaurant and bolted it from inside and started taking out the guests from the rear (service) door. From Tiffin Restaurant the two terrorists proceeded towards Kandhar Restaurant but they found the restaurant's entrance door locked from inside. They fired at the closed doors. One of the shots pierced through the glass pane and hit Dinaj Sharma, one of the hotel staff, on her right forearm. They eventually succeeded in breaking open the door and entering Kandhar Restaurant but by that time, fortunately, all the guests in the restaurant had been evacuated and the two terrorists found only two hotel employees, namely, Jorden and Pradeep Rammurthy Bengalorkar (PW 212). They threatened them that they would kill them if they tried to run away. Then they asked Bengalorkar to pour liquor on the tables and other items of furniture from the bottles in the bar counter and handed a lighter to Jorden, telling him to set fire to the furniture soaked with liquor. The lighter did not work and they asked Jorden to make the fire with matchsticks. Jorden took out a matchbox from his pocket and tried to set fire to the table cloth. The poor fellow was so nervous that he was unable to start the fire but, in the process, he burnt his own hands. As he was wringing his hands and crying that his hands were burnt, one of the two terrorists, evidently annoyed at his lack of efficiency as an arsonist, fired a burst of bullets, killing him on the spot. They then asked Bengalorkar to set the furniture on fire. He somehow succeeded in setting fire to a table. The terrorists then asked him to take them to the floor where the hotel's VIP guests were staying. Bengalorkar entered the lift, as bidden by the terrorists, but as their attention was momentarily diverted in throwing hand-grenades he quickly pressed the down button of the lift. The lift door thus closed and the lift started descending even as the terrorists fired at its closed door. Bengalorkar thus gave the slip to the terrorists and saved himself by his presence of mind. 289. Fahadullah and Abdul Rahman \"Chhota\" then went to the upper floors of the hotel in search of any VIP guests staying there. They were unable to find any but they got holed up there and fought the security forces till they were finally killed at about 7.00 a.m. on 28-11-2008. A complete and ocular account of the final encounter of the two terrorists with the National Security Guard (NSG) Commando may be seen in the evidence of Rajesh Ganpat Kadam ( PW 215) who was the Assistant Chief Security Officer, Hotel Oberoi, and who was accompanying the NSG Commandos headed by Colonel Rathi and Lt. Colonel Sharma in the final encounter with the terrorists. Before Fahadullah and Abdul Rahman \"Chhota\" were killed, they had left behind thirty-five (35) people as dead [of whom ten (10) were foreign nationals] and twenty-four (24) injured [of whom seven (7) were foreign nationals]. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It may also be noted here that once the terrorists had taken position at their respective targets of attack it did not prove easy to neutralise them or to take them out. Maharashtra Police was quite unequal to the task and, consequently, MARCOS (Naval) Commandos were called in at Hotel Taj. Finally, the whole operation at all the three places, Hotel Taj, Hotel Oberoi and N ariman House, was handed over to the National Security Guards who were able to clear the sites but not before the terrorists gave them a stiff resistance. The second of the two terrorists at Hotel Oberoi was killed at about 7.00 a.m. on 28-11-2008. Nariman House was cleared in the night of November 28 and Hotel Taj, thereafter, at about 9.00 a.m. on November 29. 293. The prosecution has documented the episodes at Leopold Cafe, Hotel Taj, Hotel Oberoi and N ariman House , as well as the Mazgaon taxi blast as exhaustively as it has documented the incidents at CST, \"Cama in\", \"Cama out\", \"Skoda robbery\" and \"Vinoli Chowpaty\" relating to the appellant and his dead companion Abu Ismail. 294.

The Police Inspector Bhagwat Kachru c Bansode (PW 208) is another substantive witness. The rest are formal witnesses and panch witnesses. 298. Having thus examined the other venues of the terrorists' violence, we fail to see how it can even be suggested that the appellant and his dead accomplice, Abu Ismail, were acting separately and that their actions were not connected in any manner with the offences committed at the other places d by the other eight (8) terrorists with whom they jointly made the sea journey to Mumbai's shore. To us it is obvious that all five (5) teams were bound together and each team was acting in execution of a common conspiracy. 299. Earlier it was observed that the landing site for the terrorists at Badhwar Park was selected with great care. Here it must be added that the e selection of the targets for attack was made with even greater care. CST is a place where people would be present in large numbers, completely defenceless and helpless, within a relatively small and confined space. The appellant and Abu Ismail went to CST for numbers and, according to plan, they were able to kill fifty-two (52) and wound one hundred and nine (109) people. The intention was plainly to shock and create terror. f 300. From CST, the appellant and Abu Ismail were headed for Malabar Hill, presumably with the intent to take captive some very important person there, which would put enormous pressure on the Government of Maharashtra and the Central Government. 301. Of the other two teams, one went to Leopold Cafe and then to the Taj Hotel, and the other to the Oberoi Hotel. Leopold Cafe is a highly popular eating and drinking establishment, frequented not only by Mumbaikars but also by domestic and international tourists in large numbers. The Cafe is open to the pavement, and it is known as a place where one can sit at leisure over a cup of coffee or a glass of beer, and watch bustling Mumbai pass by on the pavement and road just outside. The attack on Leopold was meant to kill in large numbers, including foreign tourists. g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Hotel Oberoi is a modern, super-luxury hotel. These are places where the upper crust of the country rubs shoulders with its colleagues and peers from across the globe. The attack at those two hotels and at Leopold Cafe had a dual purpose. First, the killing of wealthy and powerful Indians and foreigners would not only send shock waves across this country but would also attract international attention, which is the greatest prize and inducement for any tenorist group. Secondly, the terrorists hoped to take some \"very important people\" as hostages 47 , there, this would, they believed, enable them to negotiate with the Indian authorities regarding some highly vague and fantastic demands. 303. The attack at Nariman House was intended to somehow involve Israel in the matter and to further internationalise the issue by killing the Jewish and Israeli citizens living there. For a short while, the tenorists who had taken possession of N ariman House seemed to be succeeding in their objective as they were able to establish contact with someone called Levi in the US, who appears to have rushed in as a self-styled intermediary, negotiating to save the lives of the people taken hostage by the tenorists. 304. Thus seen, the attacks at all five targets appear to be integrally connected with each other and the appellant and Abu Ismail are as much part of the offences committed at the other places as they are responsible for the offences committed by them directly. It may even be said that even if the appellant was apprehended without firing a single shot and without personally committing any offence on the soil of India, he would still have been connected through conspiracy to the offences committed by the other four teams of tenorists in whose company he came to Mumbai. But the above discussion is meant only to reject the contention made on behalf of the appellant that, for the purpose of this appeal, there is no need to go beyond the acts directly attributed to him and his dead associate, Abu Ismail. The real and far more tangible evidence of conspiracy is yet to unfold in the following part of the judgment. 46 It is reported that it was at the Taj Mahal Hotel ballroom that, on 20-2-1918, at her eighteenth birthday party, Ruttie had accepted Mr Jinnah's hand in marriage while the band was playing the Chopin tune, So Deep is the Night. It is also reported that both Mr Jinnah, the creator of Pakistan, and Mrs Sarojini Naidu, the President of the Indian National Congress, often held court at Taj Mahal Hotel. Mr Jinnah also had an intimate connection with Mazgaon, where the bomb planted by two terrorists in a taxi exploded, killing three (3) and wounding nineteen (19) people. It is reported that Mr Jinnah devoted Thursday afternoons to visiting the grave of his wife Ruttie at the Khoja Shiite Isna'ashri Cemetry, situated at Mazgaon, Mumbai. One wonders what Quaied-e-Azam would have thought of the terrmist attack on his favourite city in the subcontinent and especially on Taj Mahal Hotel, with which he had a personal relationship of a very intimate kind. 47 In conversations (Talks Nos . 3 and 4) on mobile phones between the terrorists at Hotel Taj and their collaborators from across the border, the latter gleefully tell the former that a minister was trapped inside the hotel and that, on the orders of the Prime Minister, a helicopter was likely to come to his rescue, and further that the terrorists should find and catch him and not allow him to flee. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On the basis of the information received from the appellant a search was mounted for \"the abandoned Indian boat\" and it was found and brought to Sassoon Dock in Mumbai with the assistance of the Coast Guard. The abandoned boat was first sighted at 1640 hrs at a distance of six (6) nautical miles (south-west) from the Mumbai shore by Commandant Malhotra ( PW b 26) of the Coast Guard, who made a reconnaissance by helicopter at the request of the Additional Commissioner of Police Jagannathan ( PW 37).

He produced the office copy of the d Creek Pass bearing his signature (Ext. 201). He further stated that the owner of the vessel was one Hiralal Masani and its Tandel was Amar Singh Solanki. 313. Vinod Babula[ Masani (PW 43) stated that his was a fishing family and owned six (6) boats, including MV Kuber. He added that he looked after the family business. Masani further stated that the Kuber and another fishing boat of the family called Maa had gone out to the sea on 14-11-2008. Both e boats were scheduled to return to Porbandar within ten (10) to twelve (12) days. The boat Maa returned to Porbandar on November 25 but there was no information about the Kuber. The Tandel of Maa only said that the two boats had separated as a result of a storm in the sea. Masani first heard of the Kuber's fate at 5.00 p.m. on 27-11-2008, on getting a phone call from a Coast Guard Officer in Mumbai who made a detailed enquiry from him about the f boat and asked him to come over to Mumbai.

He had marked the satellite phone and the five (5) GPS devices sent for data retrieval and analysis as Q-119, Q-120, Q-121, Q-122, Q-123 and Q-124. Q-119 and Q-120 were marks given by him to the satellite phone and the GARMIN GPS device recovered from MV Kuber. Q-123 and Q- 124 were the other GARMIN GPS devices that were recovered from Taj Hotel. Q-121 was, in all probability, recovered from Nariman House and Q-122 b from Oberoi Hotel. Q-121 and Q-122 were Magellan GPS devices and the data in those devices were irretrievable as the internal batteries of the two devices had discharged. 330. Jackson stated before the court that his examination of the satellite phone and the five GPS received by him from the Mumbai Police C commenced from 11-2-2009, and was completed on 18-2-2009 . He explained to the court that to retrieve the data from a GPS device, the device must be connected to a computer and the data is then copied on the computer. Software is then used to examine the data copied on the computer. He stated that he had made his report after examining all the devices. He had copied the data from the GPS devices on the computer and, from the computer, d recorded the data on a CD. He identified the CD, Article 517, in court. He also identified the physical copy (\"Derivative 2\") that bore his signature and was marked Ext . 601 collectively . He further explained to the court that the waypoints on GPS were locations that might be latitude and longitude and those waypoints could be saved on the GPS. He further stated that he had prepared the maps with the help of the GARMIN software on the basis of the e waypoints retrieved from the GPS , Q-120. 331. Jackson said that \"JALA 1\" and \"JALA 2\" were the names used by the user of GPS Q-120. The waypoints list of Q-120 showed that the waypoints between Karachi and Mumbai were saved on the device. The route shown on p. 36 of the annexure to his report showed the intermediate waypoints stored by the user and those waypoints were between Karachi and Mumbai. The first waypoint was in the ocean of the Gulf of Karachi and the last waypoint was in Mumbai. He added that p. 38 of the annexure to his report showed the track back route from Mumbai to the Gulf of Karachi. Page 38 showed the waypoints of the journey of the user from \"OCEN 1\" to \"OCENA\". He explained that \"OCEN 1\" was the coast of Pakistan and \"OCENA\" was the coast of Mumbai. 332. The maps prepared by Jackson (PW 152) were based on printouts of computer-generated images. To make the maps even more explicit, the prosecution examined Sandeep Siddhlilngappa Shivangi (PW 161 ).

From the rubber dinghy that touched Mumbai's shore at Badhwar Park, we return to CST. We have earlier seen the absolute mayhem created by a the appellant and his associate, the dead Abu Ismail, at CST Railway Station. We now revisit the place looking for any evidence of conspiracy that might bind them with the other eight terrorists who were on a similar murderous spree at other venues in the city. What we find at CST appears quite innocent, something as ordinary as a piece of foam, pink-coloured foam. But that piece of foam inseparably connects the appellant to the other eight terrorists. As we b proceed further, we will find the pink foam running like a thread through all the episodes and connecting them as integral pieces of one single, horrible drama. 340. We may recall here that the pink foam first appeared among the many articles found and seized from MV Kuber. In Ext. 182, the seizure panchnama regarding the articles found and seized from the Kuber, it is listed C at Serial No. 10 as \"Six (6) pieces of pink-coloured foam of different sizes\". Serial No. 13 of the panchnama mentions a \"six (6) inch stainless steel pair of scissors\". 341. The pink foam is also present at CST. While dealing with the attack on CST in the earlier pages of the judgment, it was noted that before opening fire from his AK-47 rifle, Abu Ismail, the dead companion of the appellant d Kasab, had put a bag carrying the RDX bomb among the passengers' luggage in the waiting hall. Luckily, however, the bomb did not explode. After the carnage was over, the authorities collected the passengers' unclaimed belongings, lying scattered all over CST Railway Station, and put them all at one place. It appears that the bag containing the bomb was also picked up and was kept along with this collected baggage. In the process of returning e the luggage pieces to their respective owners who came forward to claim their belongings by-and-by, a suspicious red-and-black sack bag was discovered lying in the baggage. When the bag was inspected by police officials, it was found that it contained explosives which were later diffused by personnel of the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad. A seizure panchnama, Ext. 269, was drawn up on 3-12-2008, at 1900 hrs in the f presence of two panchas, namely, David Raj Thomas and Sham Ratan Dhake. From the panchnama it appears that inside the red-and-black nylon sack bag, there was a locked square tin box containing the indigenous explosive device (JED).

One of the articles seized from the terrace of the Cama Hospital building was a blue, purple and black-coloured Rexene bag that could be carried on the back by fastening the belts around the shoulder and the waist. The bag had the words \"CHANGING THE TIDE\" printed on it. Inside the bag, there were several articles including a pink foam piece \"51 cm x 193 cm x 1 cm in size\". 54 343. It may further be noted that two (2) other bombs placed by the terrorists near and around Taj Hotel had failed to explode. One bag containing the explosive was picked up from near a tree near Quni Tourism Chowki at a distance of fifty (50) metres from the porch of New Taj Hotel; and the other was found near Gokul Restaurant in Gokul Wine Shop Lane in front of State Bank of Hyderabad. Both the bags containing explosives were seized under the panchnama dated 27-11-2008, Ext. 736, in the presence of panchas Hiteshchandra Vijaykumar Awasthi and Amarnath Ramvilas Yadav. 344.

It is obvious that the foam was used to provide padding and cushion to the IEDs and the hand-grenades kept in the bags so as to prevent them exploding accidentally while the terrorists were carrying them on their a person. 348. The foam pieces recovered from the Kuber and found in the bags that were picked up from CST, the terrace of the Cama Hospital building and the two bags containing unexploded IEDs found near Hotel Taj and seized under the panchnama, Ext. 736, were sent for chemical examination at the Forensic Science Laboratory. b 349. Rajendra Ramchandra Mavle (PW 247) is the forensic expert who deposed before the court that all the foam pieces tallied with each other in respect of hue (appearance) and physico-thermal characteristics. He further stated to the court that the foam pieces were examined by him under \"Differential Thermal Analyser\" and that they were found to be similar in thermal characteristics. Mavle concluded that the source of all the foam c pieces was the same. He identified his report before the court, marked as Ext. 1013. 55 Intercepted phone call records 350. The most clinching evidence regarding conspiracy comes from the recordings of intercepted telephone calls between the terrorists and their co-conspirators and collaborators sitting in a foreign land that, in light of the overall facts and circumstances of the case, can only be Pakistan. Unlike the appellant and his dead companion, Abu Ismail (deceased Accused 1), who were constantly on the move, the other terrorists had gone to Hotel Taj, Hotel Oberoi and Nariman House and were holed up there, even taking hostages for some time. From their respective positions they were in regular contact with their collaborators and were constantly receiving moral support, tactical advice and guidance from them by means of mobile phones. 351. The phone calls made by the terrorists from Hotel Taj, N ariman House and Hotel Oberoi came to be noticed and were intercepted by a watchful member of the Anti-Terrorist Squad. 352. Nivruti Tukaram Kadam (PW 242) was an Inspector of Police attached to the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), Mumbai. He was looking after the technical wing of ATS, which was assigned the tasks of collecting intelligence, phone interceptions and data analysis. On the night of 26-11-2008 to 27-11-2008 , he was on duty in his office at Nagpada, Mumbai. 55 See Ext. 182 and PW 41, Gorakh Nalawade (for seizure of the foam piece s on Kuber), Ext. 269 and PW 74, Pandharinath Yeram (for seizure of the foam pieces from CST) , Ext. 486 and PW 115, Nazimuddin Sheikh (for seizure of the foam pieces from Cama Hospital) and Ext. 736 and d e f g PW 182 Prakash Bhoite (for seizure of the foam pieces from Hotel Taj): The foam pieces were numbered in the forensic science laboratory as Ext. 75 of DNA-443B-08 in Ext. 1011 (on Kuber), Ext. 1 M.494-08 in Ext. 1012 (from CST), Ext. 53 of BL No. 990/C/08 in Ext. 1009 (from Cama Hospital) and Ext. 1 ofM.516-08 and Ext. 3 of M.516-08 in Ext. 1010 (from Hotel h Taj) .

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA ( Aftab Alam, J) 131 At midnight of 26-11-2008, he received information that terrorists were making regular calls from Mobile Phone No. 9910719424. 353. In normal circumstances, a telephone interception can only be done after getting sanction from the Government but in an emergency, interception is permissible with the approval of the immediate superior who, in this case, was the officer in charge of ATS. 354. Hemant Karkare, Special IG, was the chief of ATS and, as seen above, he was killed by the appellant and Abu Ismail around midnight of 26-11-2008, when the two terrorists had snatched a Qualis police vehicle after killing him and two other officers and policemen who were travelling in that vehicle. Following the killing of Karkare, Param Bir Singh (PW 241), Additional Commissioner of Police and Karkare's deputy, had assumed charge in his place. Hence, Kadam (PW 242) obtained Param Bir Singh's written permission for intercepting calls from Mobile Phone No. 9910719424. The permission granted by Param Bir Singh was later accorded post-facto sanction by Chitkala Zutshi (PW 253), who was at that time the Additional Chief Secretary, Home Department, Government of Maharashtra. 355. On the basis of the permission granted for interception, directions were given to the service provider of the aforesaid phone number (Bharti Airtel) and to all other service providers, since the number was in \"roaming\", to transfer all calls from or to that number to the police landline number 02223053162. The calls made from or to the aforesaid mobile number thus diverted to the police landline could then be heard on headphones or the speaker of a computer with the aid of appropriate software. ATS office had software called \"Shogie\" installed in the office computer for that purpose. 356. Kadam stated before the court that the first conversation recorded by him from that mobile number commenced at 0104 hrs on 27-11-2008, and the last call from that mobile number was recorded by him at 1027 hrs of 27-11-2008. He further stated before the court that the conversation was being heard by him personally and being recorded on the hard disc of the computer simultaneously. The recordings from the hard disc of the computer were copied on to CDs and the conversations recorded on the CDs were later transcribed on paper. 357. He further told the court that, from the conversations made from mobile phone number 9910719424, he could make out that the callers from that phone were speaking from Hotel Taj and that their names were Ali, Umar, Abdul Rehman and Soheb. The two persons on the other end were called Vashibhai and Kafabhai. 358. In course of the night, Kadam came across two other mobile phone numbers, 9820704561 and 9819464530. The first of these two was being used by the terrorists at Hotel Oberoi and the second by those at Nariman House . After obtaining the necessary permissions in regard to those two phone numbers following the same procedure, Kadam intercepted and recorded the conversations made from those two phone numbers also.

The total recordings of intercepted phone calls were spread over twelve (12) hours and thirty-three (33) minutes. 359. The CDs recording the intercepted phone conversations were played in court on a laptop and, on comparing the recorded voices with the written transcripts, Kadam told the court that, except for a very few minor errors, the transcripts were accurate. He then proceeded to identify all the different CDs recording conversations from the three different mobile numbers and the transcripts of conversations made from those CDs. 360. Significantly, Kadam told the court that all the calls from the above three mobile phones were made to a single number, 012012531824, which later investigation revealed to be the number of private corporation based in New Jersey, USA, with the domain name Callphonex. The Callphonex 361. Kadam (PW 42) told the court that the collaborators of the terrorists appeared to be speaking from telephone number 012012531824. As the international code would indicate, the number was based in US. Clarification about the number comes from the evidence of Nizar Al-Sharif, who was examined by the prosecution as PW 156 . 362. The evidence of this witness was recorded through audio-video linkage. The witness was sitting in Room No. 222 of Hotel Fairfield Inn, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, where video conference facility was available. Geoffrey Maron, the Special Agent of FBI who was earlier examined as PW 153, first identified one David Shea on the screen as the FBI Agent in Los Angeles. Shea in turn identified Nizar Al-Sharif to the court on the screen. 363. Al-Sharif stated before the court that he was the owner of International Connection Services (ICS) which was a private corporation incorporated in the year 1993 and registered in the State of Delaware. The office of the Corporation was situated in New Jersey. The brand name as well as the domain name of the Corporation was Callphonex. The Callphonex telephone number, in the month of November 2008, until 6-1-2009, was (201 )253-1824. Al-Sharif further stated before the court that they were providing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Services in wholesale as well as in retail. Any person, who wanted to avail of their services, in case he was not in US, could contact them through their website. The customer had to register through email. After getting the email from the customer, they would set up services in accordance with the customer's requirement. Prepayment was necessary in all cases. He further stated that ordinarily, in case a customer availing their services made a call to any phone that displayed caller ID, the screen would display the Callphonex number [which, as noted above, was (201)253-1824 in November 2008].

Some of them were US-based and their customers could make calls to mobile numbers through VoIP. 364. He further said before the court that one person calling himself Kharak Singh (wanted Accused 21) had contacted them through email and had told them that he was a reseller of VoIP services. Kharak Singh had contacted them on 20-10-2008, by email. After correspondence with Kharak Singh on email they had provided him fifteen (15) PC 2 Phone accounts, ten (10) Common Client accounts and five (5) DID Austrian phone numbers. The email ID of Kharak Singh was Kharak-telco@yahoo.com. No specific address was provided by Kharak Singh. He had only said that he was from India. The mails received from Kharak Singh were replied to by Nizar Al- Sharif personally. The first payment made by Kharak Singh was of 250 US dollars and it was received through MoneyGram from Pakistan. The payment was made by some Mohammed lsfaq. On being shown a copy of the receipt of the MoneyGram, Al-Sharif identified it and it was then taken in evidence as Article 530. The second payment of 229 US dollars was received through Western Union. He identified the receipt of this payment as well, which was marked Article 5 31. 365. More importantly, Al-Sharif stated to the court that the services provided by him to Kharak Singh were used most heavily from 24-11-2008 to 27-11-2008. The initial use was only for testing. He further informed the court that he had supplied the following details to FBI along with his letter of 13-2-2009 (Ext. 614): \"(]) Call detail records for sub-account 310000xx and 400000xx for client Mr Kharak Singh; (2) Callphonex call detail records for calls to 5 DID numbers; (3) Voxbone call detail records to DID numbers (that Callphonex has access to and obtained on its own); (4) Three (3) chat logs between a representative of Callphonex and Mr Kharak Singh; (5) Copy of MoneyGram receipt dated 27-10-2008, and copy of Western Union receipt dated 25-11-2008; ( 6) Emails between Mr Kharak Singh and Callphonex.\" 366. He further deposed before the court that the last mail received by him from Kharak Singh was on 25-11-2008, at 12.08 p.m. and thereafter there was no contact between him and Kharak Singh. The account of Kharak Singh was closed after 25-12-2008. 367. It does not require much imagination to see that \"Kharak Singh\", claiming to be from India, was a fake identity created for the sole purpose of obtaining the VoIP services from Callphonex. But this was made very clear by the investigation made by FBI as would appear from a communication dated 18-2-2009, from the Special Agent of the Bureau (PW 153) in response to the letter rogatory issued by the Court of the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Esplanade, Mumbai, on Miscellaneous Application No. 1 of 2009.

It is noted above that among the documents furnished by Nizar Al-Sharif to FBI there were three chat logs between a representative of Callphonex and Kharak Singh and the emails between Kharak Singh and Callphonex. 370. Mr Gopal Subramanium, in his meticulous and painstaking way, took us through the three chat logs and the emails exchanged between Kharak Singh and Callphonex. We have no doubt that even in the three chat logs it is not the same person who is chatting under the fictitious name of Kharak Singh. That the persons chatting as Kharak Singh are different persons is evident from the different styles of language and their use of slang. 371. Perhaps Nizar Al-Sharif's commercial interest got the better of his sense of discretion , or perhaps he was too nai:ve to see through the clear deception. His services were thus used by a bunch of terrorists for the mass killing of innocent people. According to him, he realised that a false account was opened with him for unlawful purposes only after the massacre in Mumbai. Mobile numbers 9910719424, 9820704561 and 9819464530 and the mobile phones using those numbers 372. We have seen how the collaborators of the terrorists killing innocent people in India hid behind the phone number of Callphonex and tried to conceal the locations from which they were making calls. We shall now take a brief look at the three numbers from which the terrorists holed up in at Hotel Taj, Hotel Oberoi and Nariman House were calling or receiving calls from their collaborators. 373. A great many mobile phones were collected and seized from the various places through which the terrorists had passed as also from the vehicles used by the appellant and his dead companion, Abu Ismail, for moving through the city.

Two Nokia 1200 phones were also recovered from Nariman House a and they found mention in Ext. 771. One of the phones had IMEi No. 353526025828739. The phone was without a Sim card and it was never used. The other Nokia 1200 phone had IMEi No. 353526025842235. It had a Sim card belonging to Gabriel Holtzberg, who was first taken hostage and was later killed by the tenorists. It appears that the tenorists had taken away the b mobile phone of Gabriel Holtzberg, took out the Sim card from his mobile and put it in their own mobile phone. A call made through the Sim card of Gabriel Holtzberg would display this number on the receiving phone 9819464530. This was one of the two numbers that later came to the notice of Kadam (PW 242). 375. The fifth Nokia 1200 of silver-and-black colour was recovered from c Hotel Oberoi vide Ext. 790. Its IMEi number was 353526025933620. This mobile phone had a Sim card issued in the name of one Rita Agarwal. She was among those killed by the terrorists at Hotel Oberoi. It appears that, as with Gabriel Holtzberg, Rita Agarwal's mobile phone was also taken away by the tenorists at Hotel Oberoi, who took out the Sim card from her mobile and used it to make calls from their own mobile. Any call made through the Sim d card of Rita Agarwal would display the number 9820704561 on the receiving phone. This was the third number that had come to the notice of Kadam (PW 242). 376. It is thus clear that the tenorists at Hotel Taj were using a Sim card that was obtained in India under a fictitious name Suresh Prasad on the basis of fake identity documents. The tenorists at Nariman House and Hotel Oberoi used Sim cards snatched from their respective victims, which they used to make calls from their own mobile phones. 377.

The attack on Mumbai killing and wounding scores of innocent people was a wicked act, and the conversations between the terrorists and a their collaborators while the attack was underway appear to be its ugliest and most hateful part. Those conversations unveil warped minds conceiving perverted objectives and trying to realise those objectives through vicious and dastardly means. 381. In an early talk 56 that took place between 01.15.01 to 01.16.42 hrs on 27-11-2008, between one of the terrorists from Hotel Taj and the b collaborators, the latter appear quite anxious that the hotel building should be set on fire. They constantly urge the terrorist to start the fire but this man seems to be a little nervous as he finds himself alone holding a hostage (Ramamoorthy) while his other partners, who had gone on reconnaissance and in search of more hostages, are delayed in returning. Every time the collaborators ask him to start the fire and throw grenades he complains that c his partners have not come back even though he had told them to come back quickly. The collaborators ask him many questions about the sea journey and get answers that would not have made them very happy as everything did not go as per instructions. The terrorist in Hotel Taj told them that the Indian boat was not sunk in the sea but was left afloat. What is more, Abu Ismail's satellite phone and a GPS too were left in the boat. The only information that d seems to have pleased the collaborators was that the navigator of the Indian boat was killed by cutting his neck. [But on that score also the happiness was not complete because his body was not thrown into the sea but left on the boat itself.] In the midst of getting all this information the collaborators keep pressing the terrorist to start the fire but this man appears unequal to the task. 382. In another conversation between the terrorists at N ariman House e and the collaborators, one of the hostages, a Mexican citizen called Norma Shvarzblat Robinovich, is brought to the phone and is threatened by the collaborators that if she wanted to remain alive she must do their bidding and talk to the Indian authorities as dictated by them. The poor woman agreed to do all that they demanded and yet she was killed at the end without the slightest qualms. As noted above, the recording of the intercepted f conversation extend over twelve-and-a-half (12.5) hours. The transcripts of the recorded conversations are accordingly long. We propose to take a look at a few excerpts as samples under the following heads: 1. Exhortation to fight in the name of Islam against heresy, and the allurement of martyrdom. 2. Deception that the terrorists were Indians and were venting the g grievance of the Indian Muslims; also an attempt to involve Israel. 3. Rejoicing over the killing of the high police officers. 4. Advising the terrorists on tactics to deal with the security forces, who were called in to neutralise them. 5. Killing of the hostages. 56 Described in the tran scripts of intercepted calls from Hotel Taj: Talk No. 2 . h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The deception, the falsehood that the terrorists were Indian Muslims coming from Hyderabad and were connected with some fictitious organisation called Mujaheddin, Hyderabad Deccan, is one of the most g ominous and distressing parts of the conspiracy. If the appellant had not been caught alive and the investigating agencies had not been able to unravel the conspiracy fully and in all its devious ways, the terrorists might have passed as Indian Muslims and that would have led to devastating short-term and equally debilitating long-term consequences .

In this regard, the selection of CST as one of the targets for carnage assumes great importance. Trains leave for many parts of the country from CST. Thus, as news of the carnage spread across the country through the media, travellers would start arriving in different parts of the country, some having lost their near and dear ones at CST, some with a wounded companion and others shell-shocked by the experience of a terrorist attack on the railway station. Their first-hand eyewitness accounts of the carnage added to reports in the print media and visuals in the electronic media could be highly inflammable and could easily evoke communal violence that would be difficult to contain. 388. The deception was ominous because it aimed at destabilising Indian society and its Governments. But it was equally distressing for being so deeply untruthful. Indian Muslims may have a long list of grievances against the establishment. Some of the grievances may be fanciful, some may be of their own making and some may be substantive. Nevertheless, no Indian Muslim would even think of venting his grievance like an animal , killing, maiming and wounding innocent people; his own countrymen. This is because he is not only loyal to his faith and community but equally loves his country and fellow countrymen. Rejoicing over the killing of High Police Officials 389.

In view of the enormous evidence of all possible kinds it is clear that the terrorist attack on Mumbai was in pursuance of a larger conspiracy of which the appellant was as much part as the nine dead accused and the other wanted accused. It will be futile even to suggest that the appellant while he was shooting at CST and at the other places along with Abu Ismail had no connection with the attacks taking place at the other targets by the other eight (8) members of the terrorist group. From the evidence on record it is further clear that the conspiracy did not stop with the group of 10 terrorists leaving the Pakistani shore. It continued developing and growing even while the larger conspiracy was under execution. In course of execution of the larger conspiracy by the ten terrorists in Mumbai, they were being advised and guided to meet the contingencies arising at those three different places. In other words, newer conspiracies were being hatched even in course of execution of the larger conspiracy and the conspiracies came to an end only when all the remaining eight terrorists were killed at the three places where they were holed up. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Before parting with the transcripts, we feel compelled to say a few words about the way the terrorist attacks on Taj Hotel, Hotel Oberoi and Nariman House were covered by the mainstream electronic media and shown live on the TV screen. From the transcripts, especially those from Taj Hotel and Nariman House, it is evident that the terrorists who were entrenched at those places and more than them, their collaborators across the border were watching the full show on TV. In the transcripts there are many references to the media reports and the visuals being shown on the TV screen. The collaborators sitting in their hideouts across the border came to know about the appellant being caught alive from Indian TV: they came to know about the killing of high-ranking police officers also from Indian TV. At one place in the transcript, the collaborators and the terrorists appear to be making fun a b of the speculative report in the media that the person whose dead body was found in Kuber was the leader of the terrorist group whom his colleagues had killed for some reason before leaving the boat 57 . At another place in the transcript the collaborators tell the terrorists in Taj Hotel that the dome at the top ( of the building) had caught fire. The terrorists holed up in some room were not aware of this. The collaborators further advise the terrorists that the stronger they make the fire the better it would be for them 58 . At yet another place the terrorists at Hotel Taj tell the collaborators that they had thrown a grenade. The collaborators reply, \"the sound of the grenade has come, they have shown the grenade, the explosion has taken place, people are wounded\" 59 . At yet another place the collaborators tell the terrorists at Hotel Oberoi that the troops were making their position very strong on the roof of e the building 60 . At yet another place the collaborators tell the terrorists at Taj Hotel the exact position taken by the policemen ( close to a building that belonged to the Navy but was given to the civilians) and from where they were taking aim and firing at them (the terrorists) and advised them the best position for them to hit back at those policemen. 61 There are countless such instances to show that the collaborators were watching practically every movement of the security forces that were trying to tackle the terrorists under relentless gunfire and throwing of grenades from their end. C d f 394. Apart from the transcripts, we can take judicial notice of the fact that the terrorists attacks at all the places, in the goriest details, were shown live on the Indian TV from beginning to end almost non-stop. All the channels were competing with each other in showing the latest developments g on a minute-to-minute basis, including the positions and the movements of the security forces engaged in flushing out the terrorists.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MOHD. AJMALAMIR KASAB v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J.) 161 coverage of the terrorist attack by the channels thus gave rise to a situation where on the one hand the terrorists were completely hidden from the security forces and they had no means to know their exact position or even the kind of firearms and explosives they possessed and on the other hand the positions of the security forces, their weapons and all their operational movements were being watched by the collaborators across the border on TV screens and being communicated to the terrorists. 395. In these appeals, it is not possible to find out whether the security forces actually suffered any casualty or injuries on account of the way their operations were being displayed on the TV screen. But it is beyond doubt that the way their operations were freely shown made the task of the security forces not only exceedingly difficult but also dangerous and risky. 396. Any attempt to justify the conduct of the TV channels by citing the right to freedom of speech and expression would be totally wrong and unacceptable in such a situation. The freedom of expression, like all other freedoms under Article 19, is subject to reasonable restrictions. An action tending to violate another person's right to life guaranteed under Article 21 or putting the national security in jeopardy can never be justified by taking the plea of freedom of speech and expression. 397. The shots and visuals that were shown live by the TV channels could have also been shown after all the terrorists were neutralised and the security operations were over. But, in that case the TV programmes would not have had the same shrill, scintillating and chilling effect and would not have shot up the TRP ratings of the channels. It must, therefore, be held that by covering live the terrorists attack on Mumbai in the way it was done, the Indian TV channels were not serving any national interest or social cause. On the contrary they were acting in their own commercial interests putting the national security in jeopardy. 398. It is in such extreme cases that the credibility of an institution is tested. The coverage of the Mumbai terror attack by the mainstream electronic media has done much harm to the argument that any regulatory mechanism for the media must only come from within. Arguments I. Denial of due process Mr Raju Ramachandran 399. In the face of the evidence stacked against the appellant, overwhelming both in volume and in weight, Mr Ramachandran took a course that would neatly side-step everything. He struck at the root. Mr Ramachandran submitted that the appellant did not get a fair trial and added that the denial of fair trial, for any reason, wittingly or unwittingly, would have the same result: it would render the trial a nullity and no conviction or sentence based on such a trial would be legal or enforceable. Mr Ramachandran prefaced his submissions by gently reminding the Court ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The learned counsel submitted that the right to fair trial is an a integral part of the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, and that the fundamental right under Article 21 was inalienable and there can be no question of any waiver of the right by any person. In support of the first limb of his submission, he referred to the decisions in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of Gujarat6 2 , T. Nagappa v. Y.R. Muralidhar6 3 , Noor Aga v. State of Punjab 64 , NHRC v. State b of Gujarat6 5 , Jayendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra 66 and G. Someshwar Rao v. Samineni Nageshwar Rao 67 ; and in support of the second limb he relied upon the decisions in Behram Khurshid Pesikaka v. State of Bombay 68 and Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corpn. 69 401. Proceeding from the premise that fair trial is an inalienable right of c every person, Mr Ramachandran submitted that in case of the appellant the constitutional guarantee remained unsatisfied because of denial to him of two valuable constitutional rights/protections: first, the right to counsel at the earliest, as provided under Article 22(1) of the Constitution; and secondly, the right to protection against self-incrimination as stipulated by Article 20(3) of the Constitution. d 402. Elaborating the first submission regarding the right to counsel at the earliest, Mr Ramachandran said that the appellant was not made aware of his constitutional right to counsel under Article 22(1) of the Constitution at the time of his arrest and production before the Judicial Magistrate in remand proceedings. Mr Ramachandran submitted that a mere offer of legal aid is not the same as being made aware that one has the constitutional right to e consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner, and that simply the offer of legal aid does not satisfy the constitutional requirement. He stated that until the appellant was produced before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on 17-2-2009, for recording his confession, he was not informed of such a right. 70 The learned Magistrate also did not tell him that under the Constitution he had the fundamental and inalienable right to consult and be f represented by a lawyer, but simply asked him whether he wanted a lawyer. This, according to Mr Ramachandran, resulted in the confession being 62 (2006) 3 SCC 374 (paras 33-39 with special reference to para 38) : (2006) 2 SCC (Cri) 8 63 (2008) 5 SCC 633 (p. 636, para 8) : (2008) 2 SCC (Cri) 677 64 (2008) 16 SCC 417 (paras 71, 113, 114) : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 748 g 65 (2008) 16 SCC 497 (p. 499, para 5): (2010) 4 SCC (Cri) 315 66 (2009) 7 SCC 104 (p. 127, para 53) : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 500 67 (2009) 14 SCC 677 (p. 680, para 10) : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 213: (2009) 5 SCC (Civ) 475 68 AIR 1955 SC 123: 1955 CriLJ215: (1955) 1 SCR613 (p. 653, 2ndpara,p. 654) 69 (1985) 3 SCC 545 (pp. 569-70, paras 28 and 29) 70 This statement is factually inaccurate but in fairness to Mr Ramachandran it must be stated that, h as the facts unfolded and the correct picture emerged, he immediately corrected himself and adapted his submissions, as we shall see in due course, to the correct facts. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 163 recorded without the appellant being made aware of his constitutional right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3). Mr Ramachandran further submitted that the repeated cautioning administered by the learned Magistrate to the appellant and her admonitions to him about making the confession undoubtedly satisfied the requirements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but they fell far short of higher constitutional standards. The learned counsel maintained that telling the appellant that he was not bound to make the confession and that it could be used against him did not amount to constitutional compliance. The Magistrate was required to inform him of his rights under Articles 22(1) and 20(3) of the Constitution. It is only if an accused is so informed that he can be said to have made a constitutionally acceptable choice either to have or not to have a lawyer or to make or not to make a confession. 403. The learned counsel sought to buttress his submission by referring to the decision in Nandini Satpathy v. PL. Dani 71 and through Nandini Satpathy 71 to the decision of the US Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona 72. He referred to paras 42 to 44 of the judgment that contain the discussion regarding the stage at which the right under Article 20(3) comes into operation; paras 62 to 65 that deal with the stage at which the accused gets the right to have the assistance of a lawyer; and put particular stress on paras 21 to 34 of the judgment, where the right under Article 20(3) of the Constitution and the provisions of Section 161(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (said to be the parliamentary gloss on the constitutional clause!) are seen through the Miranda prism. 404. Apart from Nandini Satpathy 71 , Mr Ramachandran relied upon the decision of this Court in Khatri (2) v. State of Bihar 73 relating to the infamous case of blinding of prisoners in Bihar. In Khatri (2)73 , this Court reiterated that the right to free legal aid is an essential ingredient of due process that is implicit in the guarantee of Article 21 of the Constitution. 405. Mr Ramachandran also relied upon the decision of this Court in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu 74 . He referred to paras 159 to 164 of the judgment where the Court discussed the decision in Nandini Satpathy 71 and the US decision in Miranda 72 and found that the safeguards and protections provided to the accused under Sections 32 and 52 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA), apart from stemming directly from the guarantees enshrined in Articles 21 and 22(1) of the Constitution and embodying the guidelines spelt out in the earlier decisions of this Court in Kartar Singh v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 164 SUPREME COURT CASES (2012) 9 sec complete harmony with the observations of this Court in Nandini Satpathy 71 as well as the Miranda rule enunciated by the US Supreme Court. Mr Ramachandran also referred to paras 181, 182 and 185 of the judgment, a where the Court eschewed the confessional statement of the accused from consideration on the grounds that they were not apprised of the right to consult a legal practitioner either when they were initially arrested or after POTA was introduced in the case. The learned counsel contended that the reasons for which the Court held that strict compliance with the constitutional safeguards was necessary in Navjot Sandhu 74 would hold b equally good in the present case as well. As observed in that case, the protections under Sections 32 and 52 of the POTA ultimately flow from Articles 20(3), 21 and 22(1) of the Constitution. It would, therefore, be incorrect to contend that the Magistrate recording a confession under Section 164 CrPC had no obligation to comply with the Miranda rule or the requirements of Sections 32 and 52 of the POTA only because Miranda 72 and c Navjot Sandhu 74 are cases in which confessions to police officers were admissible while, under the normal law of the land, confession to police officers are not admissible in evidence. It is precisely because the police cannot be expected to inform the accused of his constitutional rights that the Magistrate must be required to do so when the accused is brought for recording his/her confession. d 406. Mr Ramachandran submitted that in Navjot Sandhu 74 the Court actually implanted the right to information within Articles 20( 3 ), 21 and 22( 1) and submitted that in order to give any meaningful content to those three articles it was necessary to read them along with Article l 9(l)(a) of the Constitution. He submitted that unless a person is informed, in clear terms, e that it is his basic right to be defended by a lawyer he would not be in a position to exercise the right under Article 22(1) in any informed and effective manner. He contended that it should be obligatory for every authority responsible for deprivation of liberty of a person to inform him of his rights. It, thus, followed that a Magistrate, at the stage of recording a confession under Section 164 CrPC, should mandatorily make the accused f aware of his rights under Articles 20(3) and 22(1). Mr Ramachandran submitted that in this case, though the Magistrate (PW 218) asked the appellant whether he required a lawyer, she was also bound to find out whether he was made this offer earlier. He further submitted that even strict compliance with Section 164 CrPC would not fulfil the constitutional requirements in the absence of a \"constitutional\" choice by the accused to avail or not to avail of a defence lawyer. He pointed out that Section 304 CrPC makes it mandatory to provide a defence lawyer at the trial stage and this requirement of law cannot be waived by the accused. In the same way, he argued, the administration of justice mandates the provision of a defence g 71 Nandini Satpath y v. P.L. Dani, (1978) 2 SCC 424 : 1978 SCC (Cri) 236 74 State (NCT of Delhi) v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 165 lawyer at the earliest because a lawyer provided at the trial stage would be disabled from offering any effective defence if he is presented with a fait a accompli in the form of a confession in which the accused condemns himself. It is, therefore, imperative that a constitutionally acceptable choice is made by the accused before a point of no return is reached. He further submitted that a statutory caution administered by a Magistrate, howsoever carefully done in letter and spirit, cannot be a substitute for a lawyer's advice. By the very nature of their differing professions, a Judge and a lawyer perform b different roles in this context. A Judge is required to be detached and can therefore only administer cautions. The nature of legal advice is entirely different. 407. Mr Ramachandran further submitted that the omission to make the appellant aware of his constitutional right to consult, and be defended by, a legal practitioner resulted in the denial of protection against self- c incrimination guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution. In support of the submission, he relied upon a recent decision of this Court in Selvi v. State of Karnataka 77 . He referred to paras 92 to 101 under the marginal heading \"Historical origins of the 'right against self-incrimination'\"; paras 102 to 112 under the marginal heading \"Underlying rationale of the right against self-incrimination\"; paras 113 to 119 under the marginal d heading \"Applicability of Article 20(3) to the stage of investigation\"; and paras 120 to 144 under the marginal heading \"Who can invoke the protection of Article 20(3)?\". Mr Gopal Subramanium 408. In reply to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, e Mr Subramanium submitted that all constitutional rights of the appellant, including the right to be defended by a lawyer and protection against self- incrimination, were fully secured and upheld and it is incorrect to say that the trial of the appellant was vitiated by denial of any constitutional right or privilege to him. Mr Subramanium agreed that the Constitution of India indeed accorded a primary status to the rights of a person accused of f committing any offences. Article 21 of the Constitution guaranteed the right to life and personal liberty in the widest amplitude, and other related provisions in the Constitution provided for the safeguards essential to preserve the presumption of innocence of the accused, as well as for the trial of the accused in an adversarial system. He further pointed out that the rights, privileges and protections accorded by the Constitution to a person accused g of committing a criminal offence were comprehensively translated into the statutory scheme framed by Parliament; and that the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, were crafted in such a way as to translate the constitutional promises to the accused into reality and to ensure that the rights, privileges and protections given to the accused are, in fact, available to him in actual practice. h 77 (2010) 7 sec 263 : (2010) 3 sec (Cri) 1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The constitutional rights and protection referred to by Mr Ramachandran are to be found in Articles 20(3), 21 and 22(1) which are as follows: \"20. Protection in respect of conviction for offences.-(l)-(2) * * * (3) No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. 21. Protection of life and personal liberty.-No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. 22. Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases.-( 1) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.\" 410. Mr Subramanium submitted that the Constitution prescribed values and norms and set out standards of socio-political life, but for actual enforcement those norms and standards were manifested in the provisions of CrPC. He submitted that in order to understand the true import and contents of the provisions of CrPC, one must look for the constitutional norms and standards incorporated in those provisions. Thus viewed, the provisions of CrPC would appear to be the constitutional guarantees at work. He referred to Section 161 CrPC that provides as follows: \"161. Examination of witnesses by police.-(1) Any police officer making an investigation under this Chapter, or any police officer not below such rank as the State Government may, by general or special order, prescribe in this behalf, acting on the requisition of such officer, may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case. (2) Such person shall be bound to answer truly all questions relating to such case put to him by such officer, other than questions the answers to which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or fmfeiture. (3) The police officer may reduce into w1iting any statement made to him in the course of an examination under this section; and if he does so , he shall make a separate and true record of the statement of each such person whose statement he records: Provided that statement made under this sub-section may also be recorded by audio-video electronic means.\" (emphasis supplied) He pointed out that the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 161 that disallow incriminating answers to police interrogations, are clearly an extension and application of the principle enshrined in Article 20(3). 411. A similar position obtains from the provisions of Section 162, which reads as follows: \"162. Statements to police not to be signed: Use of statements in evidence.-(l) No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this Chapter , shall, if reduced to writing, be signed by the person making it; nor shall any such statement or any record a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Mr Subramanium stated that sub-section (1) of Section 162, insofar as it makes any statement, in any form, made to police officers inadmissible, is a mirror reflection of the right against self-incrimination contained in Article 20(3). He pointed out that sub-section (2) of Section 162 carves out only limited exceptions to sub-section (1), to the extent of statements falling under the provisions of Sections 32(1) and 27 of the Evidence Act, 1872. 413. Section 163 CrPC is also significant in its import: \"163. No inducement to be offered.-(!) No police officer or other person in authority shall offer or make, or cause to be offered or made, any such inducement, threat or promise as is mentioned in Section 24 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872). (2) But no police officer or other person shall prevent, by any caution or otherwise, any person from making in the course of any investigation under this Chapter any statement which he may be disposed to make of his own free will: Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall affect the provisions of sub-section ( 4) of Section 164.\" ( emphasis supplied) 414. Mr Subramanium submitted that sub-section (1) of Section 163 contains the universally accepted principle, enjoining against inducement or coercion, etc.; but it is sub-section (2) that rounds off and completes the provision by introducing the distinction between a statement obtained by inducement, coercion, etc., and another made freely and voluntarily and separating the one from the other; sub-section (2) upholds the individual volition of an accused person to confess to an offence, as an attribute of his free will. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Mr Subramanium further submitted that the scheme of Sections 161 to 163 needs to be understood in the context of the investigation process in India. He stated that the inadmissibility of statements by the accused to the a police and the resultant distancing of the police from the accused are meant to adequately protect and uphold the rights and liberty of the accused. Though primarily providing a procedural framework, the Code also contained provisions meant to be substantive safeguards for an accused person. Under Indian law, there is no concept of incriminatory statements whilst in the course of police investigation [ except as contemplated under b Section 162(2)]. The law contemplates only judicial confession, recorded in accordance with Section 164 CrPC, to be admissible as evidence. 416. Section 164 CrPC is another statutory incorporation of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and it reads as follows: \"164. Recording of confessions and statements.-(l) Any Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate may, whether or not he has jurisdiction in c the case, record any confession or statement made to him in the course of an investigation under this Chapter or under any other law for the time being in force, or at any time afterwards before the commencement of the inquiry or trial: Provided that any confession or statement made under this sub-section may also be recorded by audio-video electronic means in the presence of the d advocate of the person accused of an offence: Provided further that no confession shall be recorded by a police officer on whom any power of a Magistrate has been conferred under any law for the time being in force. (2) The Magistrate shall, before recording any such confession, explain to the person making it that he is not bound to make a confession and that, if e he does so, it may be used as evidence against him; and the Magistrate shall not record any such confession unless, upon questioning the person making it, he has reason to believe that it is being ,nade voluntarily. (3) If at any time before the confession is recorded, the person appearing before the Magistrate states that he is not willing to make the confession, the Magistrate shall not authorise the detention of such person in police custody. f ( 4) Any such confession shall be recorded in the manner provided in Section 281 for recording the examination of an accused person and shall be signed by the person making the confession; and the Magistrate shall make a memorandum at the foot of such record to the following effect- 'I have explained to (name) that he is not bound to make a confession and that , if he does so , any confession he may make may be g used as evidence against him and I believe that this confession was voluntarily made.

(6) The Magistrate recording a confession or statement under this section shall forward it to the Magistrate by whom the case is to be inquired into or tried.\" (emphasis supplied) 417. Mr Subramanium pointed out that sub-section (1) of Section 164 provides for the recording of a confession during the course of an investigation under Chapter XII CrPC; sub-section (2) of Section 164 mandates the Magistrate to administer the pre-confession caution to the accused and also requires the Magistrate to be satisfied, as a judicial authority, about the confession being made voluntarily. Further, sub-section (2) has to be read with sub-section (3), wherein it is provided that if, at any time before the confession is recorded, the person appearing before the Magistrate states that he is not willing to make the confession, the Magistrate shall not authorise the detention of such person in police custody. The post- confession safeguard is incorporated under sub-section (4), wherein the Magistrate is required to make a memorandum at the foot of the confession regarding the caution administered to the accused person and a certificate to the effect that the confession as recorded is a full and true account of the statement made. The protection of the privilege of the accused against self- incrimination is thus cast as a mandatory duty upon the Magistrate, a judicial authority, under sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of Section 164. 418. Mr Subramanian further submitted that the confession of the accused under Section 164 CrPC is not a statement recorded under oath and, therefore, the proceedings retain their adversarial character and do not take any inquisitorial colour. He contrasted the recording of a confession under Section 164 with the examination of the accused as a witness in support of his own case (under Section 315 CrPC), wherein the accused is examined on oath, and pointed out that the voluntary character of the judicial confession is, thus, ascertained at three stages: (i) Under Section 164(2) , by the Magistrate prior to the recording of the confession; (ii) Under Section 164(4), by the Magistrate subsequent to the recording of the confession; and (iii) Upon the examination of the Magistrate, who recorded the confession, on oath in course of the trial. 419. Mr Subramanium argued that Indian law, in regard to the investigation of crimes, recognised and put into application the extremely important distinction between an involuntary statement obtained by inducement or coercion and a voluntary statement. The former was condemned and completely excluded from consideration as a piece of evidence but the latter was accepted as a sign of respect for the expression of free will.

Here Mr Subramanium referred to the decision of this Court in State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghacfl 8, (AIR p. 1816, para 16) in which an eleven-Judge Bench of this Court examined the true import of Article 20(3) and held that \"an accused person cannot be said to have been compelled to be a witness against himself simply because he made a statement while in b police custody without anything more\"; and that \"the mere questioning of an accused person by a police officer, resulting in a voluntary statement, which may ultimately turn out to be incriminatory, is not 'compulsion'.\" 421. In light of the decision in Kathi Kalu Oghacfl 8, Mr Subramanium submitted that voluntary statements are not proscribed by Article 20(3) and do not amount to violation of the privilege against self-incrimination. c 422. Having thus established the connections between the provisions of CrPC and the relevant articles of the Constitution, Mr Subramanium contended that the provisions of Sections 161, 162, 163 and 164 CrPC are mirror images of the constitutional safeguards provided under Articles 20(3) and 21, and that compliance with the statutory provisions would amount to effective compliance with the constitutional provisions. The provisions of d CrPC could naturally be tested against these constitutional safeguards, and the manner in which the CrPC provisions are to be interpreted would be informed by the constitutional safeguards in Articles 20 to 22, but once the CrPC provisions stand complied with, there is no scope for a separate and distinct species of constitutional compliance. Thus, the provisions of CrPC would be amenable to be tested on the grounds of \"due process\", but having e passed such a test, compliance with CrPC would entail compliance with the various constitutional safeguards. The purpose of placing such safeguards in the Constitution is not to create a separate level of compliance, but to emphasise the importance and enduring nature of these protections by giving them constitutional status . 423. Dealing with the right to legal assistance, Mr Subramanium f submitted that the right to legal aid and the stage when the right comes into effect are to be found in Article 22(1) of the Constitution, which states that: \"22. Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases.-(1) No person who is arrested . . . shall be denied the right to consult , and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.\" 424. According to Mr Subramanium, Article 22(1) has thus two significant facets: g (i) The enablement of an arrested person to consult a legal practitioner of his choice; (ii) The right of an arrested person to be represented by a legal practitioner of his choice. 78 AIR 1961 SC 1808: (1961) 2 Cri Ll 856: (1962) 3 SCR 10 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MOHD. AJMALAMIR KASAB v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 171 425. He submitted that the phrase \"to be defended'' made it clear that the character of the right guaranteed under Article 22(1) transforms from an enablement to a positive right only when an arrested person is put on trial. 426. In this regard, he made a reference to the provisions of Section 304 CrPC. He called the provisions of Section 304 CrPC as the statutory enablement of the right to legal aid and pointed out that the section provides that, in a trial before the Court of Session, a pleader may be assigned to the accused for his defence if the accused is not represented by a pleader and it appears to the court that he may not have sufficient means to engage a pleader. The effectiveness of the right to legal aid at the stage of trial is also buttressed by the provisions of Section 169 CrPC, wherein an accused may be discharged upon the completion of the process of investigation if there is insufficient evidence or no reasonable ground of suspicion to justify the forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate. 427. He added that the rationale behind the provision of the right to legal aid must be understood in the context of the Indian system of investigation. Unlike certain foreign jurisdictions, the Indian procedural and evidence laws do not permit statements made to the police to be admissible, and only judicial confessions made to a Magistrate in compliance with the provisions of Section 164 are admissible. The same position does not obtain in certain other jurisdictions, for example, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, where statements made to police officers are fully admissible and used as evidence against the accused. There are, therefore, consequences attached to statements made whilst in custody of the police in such jurisdictions, however, the same consequences do not attach under the Indian scheme of investigation of crimes. 428. Dealing with the Miranda 72 decision, Mr Subramanium submitted that the US decision was rendered in the context of a system in which statements made to police officers are admissible and it has, therefore, no application insofar as the Indian criminal process is concerned. Under Indian law, vide Chapter XII CrPC, read with Sections 24 and 25 of the Evidence Act, 1872, statements made before the police are per se inadmissible and a confession is considered as admissible only if made to a Magistrate, in accordance with the provisions of Section 164 CrPC. The Indian law, therefore, completely excludes the possibility of an extra-judicial confession extracted by the police in the course of incommunicado interrogation in which the accused is subjected to threat, inducement or coercion. 429. The learned counsel further submitted that the Miranda rule was substantially diluted even in US and the Miranda 72 decision has not been consistently and uniformly followed in the United States itself. In support of this submission, he referred to the judgment of the US Supreme Court in Davis v. United States 79 , in which it was held by that Court that the suspect 72 Miranda v. Arizona, (1966) 16 L Ed 2d 694: 384 US 436 79 (1994) 129 LEd 2d 362: 512 US 452 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Significantly, it was a observed by the US Supreme Court that: \"a suspect who knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to counsel after having that right explained to him has indicated his willingness to deal with the police unassisted.\" 430. Mr Subramanium further submitted that the principle of waiver of b the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel was further elaborated upon by the US Supreme Court in its recent judgment in the matter of Berghuis v. Thompkins 80 . In the said judgment, the US Supreme Court reiterated the requirement of an unambiguous invocation of the Miranda rights by an accused person in order to avoid difficulties of proof and to provide guidance to officers. 81 The US Supreme Court has therefore c developed a parallel jurisprudence with respect to the assessment of the waiver by the accused of his Miranda rights and has stated in Berghuis 80 that a waiver must be voluntary i.e. the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than of intimidation, coercion or deception, and made with full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. d 431. Mr Subramanium also submitted that the Miranda principles that gave the accused the right to silence and an absolute right to counsel at the stage of police interrogation have not been uniformly followed in several other jurisdictions. He pointed out that the Miranda principle has been held to be inapplicable in Australia in a judgment of the High Court of Australia in Dietrich v. R. 82 In this regard, he also referred to the judgment of the e Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Sinclair 83 . He also referred to a decision of the European Court in Salduz v. Turkey 84 , and two decisions of the UK Supreme Court in Ambrose v. Harris (Procurator Fiscal , Ohan) (Scotland) 85 and McGowan ( Procurator Fiscal, Edinburgh) v. B ( Scotland) 86 . 432. Mr Subramanium also referred to a number of academic articles and f papers to contend that, in the United States itself, the Miranda principles have been considerably eroded by later case laws. 433.

Supt., Central Excise 87 and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence v. Jugal Kishore Samra 88 , this Court had expressly declined to follow Nandini Satpathy 71 . 434. Miranda 72 and Nandini Satpathy 71 , which draws heavily upon the former, are, of course, referred with approval in D.K. Basu 76 and in Navjot Sandhu 74 , but those decisions were in completely different contexts. In D.K. Basu 76 , the Court was dealing with the use of compulsion during investigation and the need to insulate the accused from any coercive measures. It was in that connection that this Court issued guidelines incorporating the requirements that: (SCC p. 436, para 35) \"35. (10) The arrestee may be permitted to meet his lawyer during interrogation, though not throughout the interrogation.\" (emphasis supplied) Mr Subramanium submitted that the decision in D.K. Basu 76 has construed Article 22(1) as an enablement and not as a mandatory right. 435. Navjot Sandhu 74 was the case of a terrorist attack on Parliament of India and, in that case, this Court considered the import of the right to counsel in the context of the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002. Mr Subramanium submitted that a comparison of the provisions of POTA with the Miranda principle was quite apt, in that the statutory scheme of POTA, like US law, allowed confessions made to police to be admissible. With respect to the right to counsel, this Court made the following observation in para 160 of the judgment, after analysing the judgments in Miranda 72 andNandini Satpathy 71 : (Navjot Sandhu case 74 , SCC p. 722) \"160 . ... Based on the observations in Nandini Satpathy case 71 it is possible to agree that the constitutional guarantee under Article 22(1) only implies that the suspect in the police custody shall not be denied the right to meet and consult his lawyer even at the stage of interrogation. In other words, if he wishes to have the presence of the lawyer, he shall not be denied that opportunity. Perhaps, Nandini Satpathy 71 does not go so far as Miranda 72 in establishing access to a lawyer at the interrogation stage.\" 436.

He emphasised that the rights of the accused (including the right against self-incrimination and the right to legal representation) have been placed on a much higher pedestal in the Indian law, a even prior to such judicial developments in the United States. The learned counsel submitted that the constitutional provisions of Article 20(3) and Article 22(1), read with the statutory protections under Sections 161 , 162, 163 and 164 CrPC as well as Sections 24 and 25 of the Evidence Act, 1872, make the rights of an accused sacrosanct. 437. He also referred to the decision in Selvi 77 , relied upon on behalf of b the appellant, and submitted that in Selvi 77 this Court made the following observations: (SCC p. 335, para 134) \"134 . ... In Indian law, there is no automatic presumption that the custodial statements have been extracted through compulsion. In short, there is no requirement of additional diligence akin to the administration of Miranda warnings.\" (emphasis supplied) c 438. Summing up his submissions, Mr Subramanium formulated them into the following points. 438.1. The right to legal assistance under Article 22(1) is not a mandatory right upon arrest, but an enablement to be exercised by the person arrested. 438.2. The right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) does not proscribe voluntary statements made in exercise of free will and volition. d 438.3. The right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) has been statutorily incorporated in the provisions of CrPC (i.e. Sections 161, 162, 163 and 164) and the Evidence Act, 1872, as manifestations of enforceable due process, and thus compliance with statutory provisions is also compliance e with the constitutional requirements. 438.4. The right to counsel as contemplated in the judgment of Miranda 72 has not been followed in either the United States or in other jurisdictions, particularly due to the qualification of intelligent and voluntary waiver. The Court f 439. Let us first put aside the Miranda 72 decision that seems to have entered into the discussions of this case as a red herring. The Miranda 72 decision was rendered under a system of law in which an utterance made by a suspect before the police could lead to his conviction and even the imposition of the death penalty. From the judgment in Miranda case 72 it further appears that the police would subject the suspect to incommunicado interrogation in a g terribly oppressive atmosphere. The interrogator would employ all the intimidation tactics and interrogations skills at his command, not to find out the truth but to somehow crack the suspect and make him \"confess\" to his guilt. It was in such a situation that the US Supreme Court evolved the 77 Selvi V. State of Karnataka, (2010) 7 sec 263 : (2010) 3 sec (Cri) 1 72 Miranda v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J.) 175 Miranda rules, in order to provide necessary protection to the accused against self-accusation and to ensure the voluntary nature of any statement made before the police, and came to hold and direct as under: (L Ed p. 726) \"To summarize , we hold that when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, the privilege against self- incrimination is jeopardised. Procedural safeguards must be employed to protect the privilege, and unless other fully effective means are adopted to notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored, the following measures are required. He must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent , that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires. Opportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation. After such warnings have been given, and such opportunity afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement. But unless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.\" ( emphasis added) 440. We have not the slightest doubt that the right to silence and the right to the presence of an attorney granted by the Miranda 72 decision to an accused as a measure of protection against self-incrimination have no application under the Indian system of law. Interestingly, an indication to this effect is to be found in the Miranda 72 judgment itself. Having set down the principle , extracted above, that Court proceeded in the next part (Part IV) of the judgment to repel the arguments advanced against its view and to find support for its view in other jurisdictions. Part IV of the judgment begins as under: (L Ed p. 726) \"A recurrent argument made in these cases is that society ' s need for interrogation outweighs the privilege. This argument is not unfamiliar to this Court.\" 441. Rejecting the argument, the Court pointed out that very firm protections against self-incrimination were available to the accused in several other jurisdictions , in which connection it also made a reference to Indian laws. The Court observed: (Miranda case 72 , L Ed pp. 730-32) \"The experience in some other countries also suggests that the danger to law enforcement in curbs on interrogation is overplayed .... In India, confessions made to police not in the presence of a Magistrate have been excluded by rule of evidence since 1872, at a time when it operated under British law.\" 72 Miranda v.

The Court then noticed Sections 25 and 26 of the Indian Evidence Act and then referred to the decision of the Indian Supreme Court in Sarwan Singh v. State of Punjab 89 in the following words: (Miranda case 72 , L Ed a p. 732) \" ... To avoid any continuing effect of police pressure or inducement, the Indian Supreme Court has invalidated a confession made shortly after police brought a suspect before a Magistrate, suggesting: '[I]t would, we think, be reasonable to insist upon giving an accused person at least 24 hours to decide whether or not he should make a confession.' (Sarwan b Singh case 89, AIR p. 644, para 10)\" 443. The US Supreme Court, thus, clearly acknowledged and pointed out that the measures to protect the accused against self-incrimination evolved by it under the Miranda rules were already part of the Indian statutory scheme. 444. Moreover, a bare reference to the provisions of CrPC would show that those provisions are designed to afford complete protection to the c accused against self-incrimination. Section 161(2) CrPC disallows incriminating answers to police interrogations. Section 162(1) makes any statements, in any form, made to police officers inadmissible excepting those that may lead to discovery of any fact (vide Section 27 of the Evidence Act) and that may constitute a dying declaration (vide Section 32 of the Evidence Act). Coupled with these provisions of CrPC is Section 25 of the Evidence d Act that makes any confession by an accused made to a police officer completely inadmissible. Section 163 CrPC prohibits the use of any inducement, threat or promise by a police officer. And then comes Section 164 CrPC, dealing with the recording of confessions and statements made before a Magistrate. Sub-section (1) of Section 164 provides for recording any confession or statement in the course of an investigation, or at e any time before the commencement of the inquiry or trial; sub-section (2) mandates the Magistrate to administer the pre-confession caution to the accused and also requires him to be satisfied, as a judicial authority, about the confession being made voluntarily; sub-section (3) provides one of the most important protections to the accused by stipulating that in case the accused produced before the Magistrate declines to make the confession, the f Magistrate shall not authorise his detention in police custody; sub-section (4) incorporates the post-confession safeguard and requires the Magistrate to make a memorandum at the foot of the confession regarding the caution administered to the accused and a certificate to the effect that the confession as recorded is a full and true account of the statement made. Section 164 CrPC is to be read along with Section 26 of the Evidence Act, which provides that: g \"26. Confession by accused while in custody of police not to be proved against him.-No confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer , unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate , shall be proved as against such person.\" 89 AIR 1957 SC 637 : 1957 Cri LJ 1014 72 Miranda v.

It is thus clear to us that the protection to the accused against any self-incrimination guaranteed by the Constitution is very strongly built into a the Indian statutory framework and we see absolutely no reason to draw any help from the Miranda 72 principles for providing protection against self- incrimination to the accused. b C d e f g h 446. Here it will be instructive to see how the Miranda 72 decision has been viewed by this Court; in what ways it has been refened to in this Court's decisions and where this Court has declined to follow the Miranda rules. 447. Significant notice of the Miranda 72 decision was first taken by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Nandini Satpathy 71 . The appellant in that case, a former Chief Minister of Orissa, was summoned to the police station in connection with a case registered against her under Sections 5(1) and (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, and Sections 161/165, 120-B and 109 of the Penal Code, and was intenogated with reference to a long string of questions given to her in writing. On her refusal to answer, a complaint was filed against her under Section 179 of the Penal Code and the Magistrate took cognizance of the offence. She challenged the validity of the proceedings before the High Court. The High Court dismissed the petition following which the Chief Minister came to this Court in appeal against the order passed by the High Court. It was in that context that this Court made a glowing reference to the Miranda 72 decision; however, in the end, this Court refrained from entirely transplanting the Miranda rules into the Indian criminal process and, with regard to the Indian realities, \"suggested\" certain guidelines that may be enumerated as under: (Nandini Satpathy case 71 , SCC pp. 426-27) \"(a) Under Article 22(1), the right to consult an advocate of his choice shall not be denied to any person who is anested. Articles 20(3) and 22(1) may be telescoped by making it prudent for the police to permit the advocate of the accused to be present at the time he is examined. Oveneaching Article 20(3) and Section 161(2) will be obviated by this requirement. But it is not as if the police must secure the services of a lawyer, for, that will lead to 'police station-lawyer' system with all its attendant vices. If however an accused expresses the wish to have his lawyer by his side at the time of examination, this facility shall not be denied, because, by denying the facility, the police will be exposed to the serious reproof that they are trying to secure in secrecy and by coercing the will an involuntary self-incrimination. It is not as if a lawyer's presence is a panacea for all problems of self-incrimination, because, he cannot supply answers or whisper hints or otherwise interfere with the course of questioning except to intercept where intimidatory tactics are tried and to caution his client where incrimination is attempted and to insist on questions and answers being noted where 72 Miranda v.

The lawyer cannot harangue the police, but may help his client and complain on his behalf. The police also need not wait for more than a reasonable time for the a advocate's arrival. (b) Where a lawyer of his choice is not available, after the examination of the accused, the police officer must take him to a Magistrate, a doctor or other willing and responsible non-partisan official or non-official and allow a secluded audience where he may unburden himself beyond the view of the police and tell whether he has suffered b duress, in which case he should be transferred to judicial or other custody where the police cannot reach him. The collocutor communicate the relevant conversation to the nearest Magistrate.\" 448. In later decisions, Nandini Satpathy 71 guidelines and the Miranda rule are referred to, approved and followed in an ancillary way when this c Court moved to protect or expand the rights of the accused against investigation by lawless means, but we are not aware of any decision in which the Court might have followed the core of the Nandini Satpathy guidelines or the Miranda rule. 449. In Poolpandi 87 , the appellants before this Court, who were called for interrogation in course of investigation under the provisions of the Customs d Act, 1962, and the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, claimed the right of presence of their lawyer during interrogation, relying strongly on Nandini Satpathy 71 . The question before the Court was thus directly whether a person summoned for interrogation is entitled to the presence of his lawyer during questioning. But a three-Judge Bench of this Court rejected the appeal, e tersely observing in para 4 of the judgment as under: (Poolpandi case 87 , SCC p. 261) \"4. Both Mr Salve and Mr Lalit strongly relied on the observations in Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani 71 . We are afraid, in view of two judgments of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Ramesh Chandra Mehta v. State of WB. 90 and Illias v. Collector of Customs 91 the stand of the f appellant cannot be accepted. The learned counsel urged that since Nandini Satpathy case 71 was decided later, the observations therein must be given effect to by this Court now. There is no force in this argument.\" 450.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 179 Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, had the right of the presence of his a lawyer at the time of interrogation. The Court, after discussing the decision in Nandini Satpathy 71 and relying upon the decision in Poolpandi 87 , rejected the claim; but, in light of the decision in D.K. Basu 76 and with regard to the special facts and circumstances of the case, directed that the interrogation of the respondent may be held within sight of his advocate or any person duly authorised by him, with the condition that the advocate or person authorised b by the respondent might watch the proceedings from a distance or from beyond a glass partition but he would not be within hearing distance, and the respondent would not be allowed to have consultations with him in the course of the interrogation. 451. But, as has been said earlier, Nandini Satpathy 71 and Miranda 72 may also be found referred quite positively, though in a more general way, in c several decisions of this Court. In D.K. Basu 76 , this Court, while dealing with the menace of custodial violence, including torture and death in the police lock-up, condemned the use of violence and third-degree methods of interrogation of the accused, and described custodial death as one of the worst crimes against the society. In para 22 of its judgment, the Court observed: (D.K. Basu case 76 , SCC p. 429) d \"22 .... Any form of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment would fall within the inhibition of Article 21 of the Constitution, whether it occurs during investigation, interrogation or otherwise .... The precious right guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India cannot be denied to convicts, undertrials, detenus and other prisoners in custody, except according to the procedure established by law by placing such e reasonable restrictions as are permitted by law.\" 452. In that connection, the Court examined international conventions and declarations on the subject and visited other jurisdictions, besides relying upon earlier decisions of this Court, and laid down a set of guidelines to be strictly followed in all cases of arrest or detention as preventive measures. While dealing with the question of striking a balance between the f fundamental rights of the suspect-accused and the necessity of a thorough investigation in serious cases that may threaten the very fabric of society, such as acts of terrorism and communal riots, etc. this Court, in para 32 of the judgment, referred to the opening lines of Part IV of the judgment in Miranda 72: (D.K.

That right cannot be abridged.' (Miranda case 72, L Ed pp. 726-27)\" (emphasis in original) 453. Navjot Sandhu 74 is a case under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (in short \"POTA\"). The law of POTA is a major departure from the ordinary mainstream criminal law of the country. Under Section 32 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002, contrary to the provisions of CrPC and b the Evidence Act, as noted above in detail, a confession made by an accused before a police officer, not lower in rank than a Superintendent of Police, is admissible in evidence though subject, of course, to the safeguards stipulated in sub-sections (2) to (5) of Section 32 and Section 52 that lay down the requirements to be complied with at the time of the arrest of a person. Insisting on a strict compliance with those safeguards, the Court in Navjot c Sandhu 74 pointed out that those safeguards and protections provided to the accused were directly relatable to Articles 21 and 22(1) of the Constitution and incorporated the guidelines spelled out by this Court in Kartar Singh 75 and D.K. Basu 76 . In that regard, the Court also referred in para 55 of the judgment to the decision in Nandini Satpathy 71 , and in para 63 to the d Miranda 72 decision, observing as follows: (Navjot Sandhu case 74 , SCC p. 678) \"63. In the United States, according to the decisions of the Supreme Court viz. Miranda v. Arizona 72 ; Escobedo v. Illinois 93 the prosecution cannot make use of the statements stemming from custodial interrogation unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards to secure the right e against self-incrimination and these safeguards include a right to counsel during such interrogation and warnings to the suspect/accused of his right to counsel and to remain silent. In Miranda case 72 ( decided in 1966), it was held that the right to have counsel present at the interrogation was indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and to ensure that the right to choose f between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process. However, this rule is subject to the conscious waiver of right after the individual was warned of his right.\" 454. As we see Navjot Sandhu 74 , it is difficult to sustain Mr Ramachandran's submission made on that basis . To say that the safeguards built into Section 32 of POTA have their source in Articles 20(3), g 72 Miranda v. Arizona, (1966) 16 L Ed 2d 694: 384 US 436 74 State (NCTof Delhi) v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J.) 181 21 and 22( 1) is one thing , but to say that the right to be represented by a lawyer and the right against self-incrimination would remain incomplete and unsatisfied unless those rights are read out to the accused and further to contend that the omission to read out those rights to the accused would result in vitiating the trial and the conviction of the accused in that trial is something entirely different. As we shall see presently, the obligation to provide legal aid to the accused as soon as he is brought before the Magistrate is very much part of our criminal law procedure, but for reasons very different from the Miranda 72 rule, aimed at protecting the accused against self-incrimination. And to say that any failure to provide legal aid to the accused at the beginning, or before his confession is recorded under Section 164 CrPC, would inevitably render the trial illegal is stretching the point to una cc eptable extremes. 455. What seems to be overlooked in Mr Ramachandran's submission is that the law of POTA is a major departure from the common criminal law process in this country. One can almost call POTA and a few other Acts of its ilk as exceptions to the general rule. Now, in the severe framework of POTA, certain constitutional safeguards are built into Section 32, and to some extent in Section 52 of the Act. But the mainstream criminal law procedure in India, which is governed by CrPC and the Evidence Act, 1872 has a fundamentally different and far more liberal framework, in which the rights of the individual are protected, in a better and more effective manner, in different ways. It is, therefore, wrong to argue that what is said in context of POTA should also apply to the mainstream criminal law procedure. 456. We are also not impressed by Mr Ramachandran's submission that providing a lawyer at the stage of trial would provide only incomplete protection to the accused because, in case the accused had already made a confession under Section 164 CrPC, the lawyer would be faced with a fait accompli and would be defending the accused with his hands tied. 457. The object of the criminal law process is to find out the truth and not to shield the accused from the consequences of his wrongdoing. A defence lawyer has to conduct the trial on the basis of the materials lawfully collected in the course of investigation. The test to judge the constitutional and legal acceptability of a confession recorded under Section 164 CrPC is not whether the accused would have made the statement had he been sufficiently scared by the lawyer regarding the consequences of the confession. The true test is whether or not the confession is voluntary. If a doubt is created regarding the voluntariness of the confession, notwithstanding the safeguards stipulated in Section 164 it has to be trashed; but if a confession is established as voluntary it must be taken into account, not only constitutionally and legally but also morally. 458. In light of the above discussion, we are in agreement with the submissions of Mr Subramanium as formulated in paras 438.2. and 438.3. (supra) of his summing up. We accept that the right against self-incrimination 72 Miranda v. Arizona , (1966) 16 L Ed 2d 694 : 384 US 436 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

We also accept that the right against self- incrimination under Article 20(3) is fully incorporated in the provisions of a CrPC (Sections 161, 162, 163 and 164) and the Evidence Act, 1872, as manifestations of enforceable due process, and thus compliance with these statutory provisions is also equal compliance with the constitutional guarantees. 459. But on the issue of the right of the suspect or the accused to be represented by a lawyer, we find Mr Subramanium's submissions equally b unacceptable. Mr Subramanium contends that Article 22(1) merely allows an arrested person to consult a legal practitioner of his choice and the right to be defended by a legal practitioner crystallises only at the stage of commencement of the trial in terms of Section 304 CrPC. We feel that such a view is quite inconect and insupportable for two reasons. First, such a view is based on an unreasonably restricted construction of the constitutional and c statutory provisions; and second, it overlooks the socio-economic realities of the country. 460. Article 22(1) was part of the Constitution as it came into force on 26-1-1950. The Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (2 of 1974), that substituted the earlier Code of 1898, came into force on 1-4-1974. The Criminal d Procedure Code, as conectly explained by Mr Subramanium in his submissions, incorporated the constitutional provisions regarding the protection of the accused against self-accusation. The Criminal Procedure Code also had a provision in Section 304 regarding access to a lawyer, to which Mr Subramanium alluded in support of his submission that the right to be defended by a legal practitioner would crystallise only on the e commencement of the trial. 461. But the Constitution and the body of laws are not frozen in time. They comprise an organic structure developing and growing like a living organism. We cannot put it better than in the vibrant words of Justice Vivian Bose, who, dealing with the incipient Constitution in State of WB. v. Anwar Ali Sarkar9 4 made the following observations: (AIR p. 103, para 85) f \"85. I find it impossible to read these portions of the Constitution without regard to the background out of which they arose . I cannot blot out their history and omit from consideration the brooding spirit of the times. They are not just dull, lifeless words static and hidebound as in some mummified manuscript, but living flames intended to give life to a great nation and order its being, tongues of dynamic fire, potent to mould g the future as well as guide the present. The Constitution must, in my judgment, be left elastic enough to meet from time to time the altering conditions of a changing world with its shifting emphasis and differing needs.

In the more than four decades that have passed since, true to the exhortation of Justice Bose, the law, in order to serve the evolving needs of the Indian people, has made massive progress through constitutional amendments, legislative action and, not least, through the pronouncements by this Court. Article 39-A came to be inserted in the Constitution by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 3-1-1977 as part of the \"Directive Principles of the State Policy\". The Article reads as under: \"39-A. Equal justice and free legal aid.-The State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.\" 463. In furtherance to the ideal of Article 39-A, Parliament enacted the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, that came into force from 9-11-1995. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act, insofar as relevant for the present, reads as under: \"Article 39-A of the Constitution provides that the State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.\" (emphasis added) 464. Sections 12 and 13 in Chapter IV of the Act deal with entitlement to legal services, and provide for legal services under the Act to a very large class of people, including members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, women and children and persons in receipt of annual income less than rupees nine thousand (Rs 9000) if the case is before a court other than the Supreme Court, and less than rupees twelve thousand (Rs 12,000) if the case is before the Supreme Court. As regards income, an affidavit made by the person concerned would be regarded as sufficient to make him eligible for entitlement to legal services under the Act. In the past seventeen (17) years since the Act came into force, the programme of legal aid had assumed the proportions of a national movement. 465. All this development clearly indicates the direction in which the law relating to access to lawyers/legal aid has developed and continues to develop. It is now rather late in the day to contend that Article 22(1) is merely an enabling provision and that the right to be defended by a legal practitioner comes into force only on the commencement of trial as provided under Section 304 CrPC. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Mr Subrarnaniurn is quite right and we are one with him. in holding that the provisions of CrPC and the a Evidence Act fully incorporate the constitutional guarantees, and that the statutory framework for the criminal process in India affords the fullest protection to personal liberty and dignity of an individual. We find no flaws in the provisions in the statute books, but the devil lurks in the faithful application and enforcement of those provisions. It is comm.on knowledge, of which we take judicial notice, that there is a great hiatus between what the law b stipulates and the realities on the ground in the enforcement of the law. The abuses of the provisions of CrPC are perhaps the rnost subversive of the right to life and personal liberty, the rnost precious right under the Constitution, and the hum.an rights of an individual. Access to a lawyer is, therefore, imperative to ensure compliance with statutory provisions, which are of high standards in them.selves and which, if duly corn.plied with, will leave no room. for any c violation of constitutional provisions or hum.an rights abuses. 467. In any case, we find that the issue stands settled long ago and is no longer open to a debate. More than three decades ago, in Hussainara Khatoon (4) v. State of Bihar 95 , this Court referring to Article 39-A, then newly added to the Constitution, said that the article emphasised that free legal aid was an unalienable element of a \"reasonable, fair and just\" d procedure, for without it a person suffering from. economic or other disabilities would be deprived from. securing justice. In para 7 of the judgrnent the Court observed and directed as under: (SCC p. 105) \"7. . .. The right to free legal services is, therefore, clearly an essential ingredient of 'reasonable, fair and just', procedure for a person accused of an offence and it rnust be held implicit in the guarantee of e Article 21. This is a constitutional right of every accused person who is unable to engage a lawyer and secure legal services on account of reasons such as poverty, indigence or incommunicado situation and the State is under a mandate to provide a lawyer to an accused person if the circumstances of the case and the needs of justice so require, provided of course the accused person does not object to the provision of such f lawyer. We would, therefore, direct that on the next rem.and dates, when the undertrial prisoners, charged with bailable offences, are produced before the Magistrates, the State Government should provide them. a lawyer at its own cost for the purpose of making an application for bail, provided that no objection is raised to such lawyer on behalf of such undertrial prisoners and if any application for bail is rnade, the Magistrates should dispose of the sarne in accordance with the broad g outlines set out by us in our judgrnent dated 12-2-1979 96 .

Two years later, in Khatri (2)7 3 relating to the infamous case of blinding of prisoners in Bihar, this Court reiterated that the right to free legal a aid is an essential ingredient of due process, which is implicit in the guarantee of Article 21 of the Constitution. In para 5 of the judgment, the Court said: (SCC p. 631) \"5 .... This Court has pointed out in Hussainara Khatoon (4) case 95 which was decided as far back as 9-3-1979 that the right to free legal services is clearly an essential ingredient of reasonable, fair and just b procedure for a person accused of an offence and it must be held implicit in the guarantee of Article 21 and the State is under a constitutional mandate to provide a lawyer to an accused person if the circumstances of the case and the needs of justice so require, provided of course the accused person does not object to the provision of such lawyer.\" (emphasis supplied) c 469. Then, brushing aside the plea of financial constraint in providing legal aid to an indigent, the Court went on to say: [Khatri (2) case 73 , SCC pp. 631-32, para 5] \"5 .... Moreover, this constitutional obligation to provide free legal services to an indigent accused does not arise only when the trial commences but also attaches when the accused is for the first time d produced before the Magistrate. It is elementary that the jeopardy to his personal liberty arises as soon as a person is arrested and produced before a Magistrate, for it is at that stage that he gets the first opportunity to apply for bail and obtain his release as also to resist remand to police or jail custody. That is the stage at which an accused person needs competent legal advice and representation and no e procedure can be said to be reasonable, fair and just which denies legal advice and representation to him at this stage. We must, therefore, hold that the State is under a constitutional obligation to provide free legal services to an indigent accused not only at the stage of trial but also at the stage when he is first produced before the Magistrate as also when he is remanded from time to time.\" (emphasis supplied) f 470. In para 6 of the judgment, this Court further said: [Khatri (2) case 73 , sec p. 632, para 6] \"6.

The resounding words of the Court in Khatri (2)7 3 are equally, if not more, relevant today than when they were first pronounced. In Khatri (2)73 the Court also alluded to the reasons for the urgent need of the accused to access a lawyer, these being the indigence and illiteracy of the vast majority b of Indians accused of crimes. 472. As noted in Khatri (2 )73 as far back as in 1981, a person arrested needs a lawyer at the stage of his first production before the Magistrate, to resist remand to police or jail custody and to apply for bail. He would need a lawyer when the charge-sheet is submitted and the Magistrate applies his mind to the charge-sheet with a view to determine the future course of c proceedings. He would need a lawyer at the stage of framing of charges against him and he would, of course, need a lawyer to defend him in trial. 473. To deal with one terrorist, we cannot take away the right given to the indigent and underprivileged people of this country by this Court thirty-one (31) years ago. 474. We, therefore, have no hesitation in holding that the right to access d to legal aid, to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner, arises when a person arrested in connection with a cognizable offence is first produced before a Magistrate. We, accordingly, hold that it is the duty and obligation of the Magistrate before whom a person accused of committing a cognizable offence is first produced to make him fully aware that it is his right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner and, in case he has no means to e engage a lawyer of his choice, that one would be provided to him from legal aid at the expense of the State. The right flows from Articles 21 and 22(1) of the Constitution and needs to be strictly enforced. We, accordingly, direct all the Magistrates in the country to faithfully discharge the aforesaid duty and obligation and further make it clear that any failure to fully discharge the duty would amount to dereliction in duty and would make the Magistrate f concerned liable to departmental proceedings. 475. It needs to be clarified here that the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner is not to be construed as sanctioning or permitting the presence of a lawyer during police interrogation. According to our system of law, the role of a lawyer is mainly focused on court proceedings. The accused would need a lawyer to resist remand to police or judicial custody and for g granting of bail; to clearly explain to him the legal consequences in case he intended to make a confessional statement in terms of Section 164 CrPC; to represent him when the court examines the charge-sheet submitted by the police and decides upon the future course of proceedings and at the stage of the framing of charges; and beyond that, of course, for the trial. It is thus to be seen that the right to access to a lawyer in this country is not based on the h 73 Khatri (2) v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 187 Miranda 72 principles, as protection against self-incrimination, for which there are more than adequate safeguards in Indian laws. The right to access to a lawyer is for very Indian reasons; it flows from the provisions of the Constitution and the statutes, and is only intended to ensure that those provisions are faithfully adhered to in practice. 476. At this stage the question arises, what would be the legal consequence of failure to provide legal aid to an indigent who is not in a position, on account of indigence or any other similar reasons, to engage a lawyer of his own choice? 477. Every accused unrepresented by a lawyer has to be provided a lawyer at the commencement of the trial, engaged to represent him during the entire course of the trial. Even if the accused does not ask for a lawyer or he remains silent, it is the constitutional duty of the court to provide him with a lawyer before commencing the trial. Unless the accused voluntarily makes an informed decision and tells the court, in clear and unambiguous words, that he does not want the assistance of any lawyer and would rather defend himself personally, the obligation to provide him with a lawyer at the commencement of the trial is absolute, and failure to do so would vitiate the trial and the resultant conviction and sentence, if any, given to the accused (see Suk Das v. VT of Arunachal Pradesh 97 ). 478. But the failure to provide a lawyer to the accused at the pre-trial stage may not have the same consequence of vitiating the trial. It may have other consequences like making the delinquent Magistrate liable to disciplinary proceedings, or giving the accused a right to claim compensation against the State for failing to provide him legal aid. But it would not vitiate the trial unless it is shown that failure to provide legal assistance at the pre- trial stage had resulted in some material prejudice to the accused in the course of the trial. That would have to be judged on the facts of each case. 479. Having thus enunciated the legal position, we may examine the facts of the appellant's case. As noted in the earlier part of the judgment (under the marginal heading \"Kuber\"), the appellant was arrested by Marde (PW 48) at DCB, CID, Unit III, on 27-11-2008, at 10.45 p.m. At the time of his arrest the appellant stated that he was a Pakistani national and he did not have any friend or relative in India. Marde, accordingly, made a note in \"the Record of Formalities to be Followed at the Time of Arrest\" 98 that intimation of his arrest could not be given to anyone in India but information about his relatives was being procured for giving intimation to them (in Pakistan). He added that information about his arrest was duly given to the Crime Branch, the Control Room and the superior officers. He also noted in the arrest panchnama that the appellant belonged to an economically weaker section, with an annual income of under rupees twenty thousand (Rs 20,000) per 72 Miranda v.

What is important for the present, however, is the note in \"the Record of Formalities .... \" that the appellant refused the offer of legal aid made to him. a 480. We were also shown an undated letter written by the appellant to the Pakistani Consulate/High Commission (\"Pakistani Wakalat\"), New Delhi. The letter is in broken Urdu and is written in half-literate handwriting. The appellant handed over the letter to Marde on 10-12-2008. Marde passed the letter to his superiors, and the ACP (Crime), Mumbai, forwarded it to the Joint Secretary (Foreigners), Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, b on 11-12-2008, with a request to arrange Consular access for the appellant. In this letter, the appellant asserts his Pakistani identity and nationality, and states that after having received armed training at different places in Pakistan, he and his associates made an attack on India. In the exchange of firing with the police, Ismail was killed and he received gunshot injuries. He requested legal aid and asked that the Pakistani authorities should make arrangements c to take the dead body of Ismail to his home. He signed the letter as \"Yours Patriotic\" (\"Aapka Watan Parast'') Mohammad Ajmal. 481. Further, on 26-12-2008, on being produced before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, he handed over a similar letter, written by him in Urdu, to the Magistrate. In this letter, he once again asserted his Pakistani identity and nationality, and requested a Pakistani lawyer. In this d letter, he clearly said that he did not want any Indian lawyer for his defence. He also said that he had already written a letter to the Pakistani Consulate/High Commission, requesting a lawyer, but he failed to get any reply from there. He requested the Magistrate to make a request on his behalf to the Pakistani Consulate/High Commission for providing him legal aid. On that date, the court remanded him to magisterial custody for the purposes of an identification parade, recording in the order-sheet that the appellant had e requested a Pakistani lawyer. On 29-12-2008, the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 37th Court, Esplanade, Mumbai, took the rather unusual step of directly forwarding the appellant's letter to the \"Hon'ble Ambassador, Pakistan\", with a covering letter under his seal and signature. Unfortunately for the appellant, the country of his nationality was in a mode of complete denial at that stage, and there does not seem to be even an f acknowledgment of his letters requesting a Pakistani lawyer. On 17-2-2009, the appellant was produced before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for recording his confession under Section 164 CrPC, and we have already seen in great detail the proceedings of the next four dates till 21-2-2009. On 25-2-2009, a charge-sheet was submitted in the case, and on 23-3-2009, the appellant was produced before the Sessions Court through g electronic video linkage for the first time. He then made a request to be given a lawyer at the expense of the State. On 30-3-2009, the court appointed Ms Anjali Waghmare to represent the appellant from the panel of lawyers maintained by the court. Moreover, since the appellant was charged with offences carrying the death penalty, under legal aid rules he was entitled to be defended by a senior lawyer assisted by a junior.

At this stage, one Kaikhushru Lam, who had been clamouring for some time to be allowed to represent Kasab, filed a petition against the appointment of Ms Anjali Waghmare, stating that she was representing a victim of the terrorist attack and a potential witness in the trial for compensation for the victim, in a separate civil proceeding. When this fact came to light, the trial Judge revoked the appointment of Ms Anjali Waghmare by a reasoned order passed on 15-4-2009, observing that there was a possibility of conflict of interests. Then, after careful consideration and consultations with a number of senior advocates, the court finally chose Mr Abbas Kazmi, advocate, to represent the appellant. The court selected Mr Kazmi in consultation with the President of the Bar, and taking into account the magnitude of the case and the competence and experience of Mr Kazmi. Mr Kazmi was then provided a chamber on the first floor of the court building and was given all the facilities to conduct the case properly and without any difficulty (including round-the-clock armed security!). 482. On 17-4-2009, the confession of the appellant recorded by the Judicial Magistrate was opened before the court and copies were given to the Special Public Prosecutor and Mr Kazmi. On that very day, Mr Kazmi submitted an application (Ext. 18) stating that the appellant retracted from the confession recorded before the Magistrate. On the same day, the prosecution opened its case. It is another matter that, towards the end of the trial, Mr Kazmi picked repeated quarrels with the court. From the orders passed by the court in that regard, it is clear that Mr Kazmi was bent upon delaying the trial proceedings and was raising groundless objections at every step, trying to make it impossible for the court to proceed with the trial. As a result, the court was eventually forced to remove Mr Kazmi from the trial. Mr Kazmi challenged the court's order removing him from the trial before the High Court, but the High Court affirmed the order of the trial court. It may be noted here that even Mr Ramachandran did not find any fault with the decision of the court to remove Mr Kazmi from the court proceedings. From that stage, the appellant was represented by Mr Pawar, who seems to have handled the case as well as anyone could have done in face of the evidence against the appellant. 483. On the basis of the appellant's two letters in which he sought the help of the Pakistani Consulate/High Commission to provide him with a Pakistani lawyer, Mr Ramachandran submitted that it is clear that the appellant wanted a lawyer but he wanted a lawyer who should be Pakistani. He contended that it was, therefore, the duty of the court either to make arrangements for him to be represented by a Pakistani lawyer or to tell him clearly that his request could not be acceded to, but that under the Constitution of India he had the right to be defended by a lawyer and, in case he so wished, he would be given adequate legal representation. He argued that apart from the constitutional and legal principles, the rules of natural justice demanded that the appellant be so informed. 484. We feel that Mr Ramachandran is taking the matter to unacceptable extremes.

He then wrote a letter to the Pakistani High Commission asking to be provided with a lawyer. He made a similar request in a second letter that was handed a over to the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. In the second letter, there is an assertion that he did not want to be represented by an Indian lawyer. It is thus clear that, in his mind, the appellant was still at war with India, and he had no use for a lawyer from the enemy country. Moreover , the negative assertion that he did not want an Indian lawyer itself implies that he had received offers of legal counsel. But those offers were not acceptable to him. b 485. The appellant's refusal to accept the services of an Indian lawyer and his demand for a lawyer from his country cannot be anything but his own independent decision. The demand for a Pakistani lawyer in those circumstances, and especially when Pakistan was denying that the appellant was even a Pakistani citizen, might have been impractical, even foolish, but the man certainly did not need any advice from an Indian court or authority c as to his rights under the Indian Constitution. He was acting quite independently and, in his mind, he was a \"patriotic\" Pakistani at war with this country. 486. On 23-3-2009, the appellant finally asked for a lawyer, apparently convinced by then that no help would come from Pakistan or anywhere else. He was then immediately provided with a set of two lawyers. d 487. In the aforesaid facts we are firmly of the view that there is no question of any violation of any of the rights of the appellant under the Indian Constitution. He was offered the services of a lawyer at the time of his anest and at all relevant stages in the proceedings. We are also clear in our view that the absence of a lawyer at the pre-trial stage was not only as per the wishes of the appellant himself, but that this absence also did not cause him e any prejudice in the trial. Too little time allowed to the lawyer for preparation 488. Mr Ramachandran submitted that after Mr Kazmi was appointed by the court to represent the appellant, he filed an application on 21-4-2009, requesting for grant of four weeks' time to prepare a reply to the submissions made by the Special Public Prosecutor under Section 226 CrPC. His application was only partly allowed and he was given only eight days' time, till 2-5-2009, to prepare a reply to the address of the Special Public Prosecutor. On that date, Mr Kazmi submitted an application raising the issue of the juvenility of the appellant, which was rejected by the court after it held an enquiry into the matter. Mr Ramachandran submitted that the time of eight days given by the trial court to the court-appointed lawyer was unreasonably short, considering that Mr Kazmi had made a reasonable request for four weeks' time. The learned counsel submitted that justice is not only to be done but also to be seen to be done, and the short time granted to the defence counsel fell foul of this principle and thus affected fair trial. He pointed out that while appointing Mr Kazmi the court itself recognised that he was a lawyer of some standard and would be required to adjust his other f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Mr Ramachandran, therefore, submitted that the trial procedure was also vitiated and that it cannot be said to be just, fair and reasonable because of the denial of sufficient time to the defence lawyer to prepare his case. 489. In support of the submission, Mr Ramachandran relied upon an unreported decision of this Court in Onais Alam v. State of U.P. 99 , in which this Court observed that an amicus curiae may feel hesitation in asking for time but the court itself must allow adequate time to him for preparing the case. He also relied upon the decision of this Court in Bashira v. State of U.P.100 In that case, the court had proceeded with the trial on the same day on which it appointed the amicus to represent the accused. This Court held that the defence was not given sufficient time and, accordingly, set aside the judgments of the courts below and remanded the case for retrial. Mr Ramachandran relied upon yet another decision of this Court in Ranchod Mathur Wasawa v. State of Gujarat 101. In this case, though this Court held that sufficient time was given to the counsel representing the accused, it observed that the courts should adopt a sensitive approach to see that the accused felt confident that the counsel chosen for him by the court has had adequate time and material to defend him properly. 490. Mr Kazmi was appointed to represent the appellant on 16-4-2009 and he made an application for time on 21-4-2009. The court allowed him eight (8) days' time, which cannot be said to be unreasonable. It is true that during those eight (8) days some very brief hearings were held on 2-3 days on the issue of the juvenility of the appellant. But that does not mean that the counsel for the appellant was not given sufficient time to prepare for the case. 491. Mr Subramanium gave us a chart showing not only the day-to-day developments in the trial but also giving details of the hours of the court proceedings on each day, and from this chart we are satisfied that Mr Kazmi was allowed ample time for preparation. 492. It would be pertinent to note here that Mr Kazmi himself never complained about not being given sufficient time. We may further note that, from the record of proceedings of the trial court, Mr Kazmi does not appear to be the non-complaining type, one who would suffer silently or take things lying down. In the later stages of the trial, Mr Kazmi raised all kinds of objections and left no opportunity to noisily protest against the procedural decisions of the trial court, yet he never complained that he was given insufficient time for preparation. 493. We further find that, in the course of the trial, when Mr Kazmi requested for adjournment for cross-examination of some important witnesses, the court accommodated him on most occasions. We are, therefore, unable to agree with Mr Ramachandran that the defence was not allowed sufficient time for preparation of the case and that denial of sufficient time vitiated the trial. 99 Criminal Appeal No. 284 of 1968, decided on 17-12-1968 100 AIR 1968 SC 1313 : 1968 Cri LJ 1495 : (1969) 1 SCR 32 101 (1974) 3 sec 581, para 1 : 1974 sec (Cri) 59 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Mr Ramachandran feebly submitted that the evidence adduced by the prosecution did not fully establish all the charges against the appellant. a But finding us not inclined to even listen to this he moved on to his other submissions trying to chip away at the prosecution case in different ways. III. Confession not voluntary and liable to be eschewed from consideration 495. Mr Raju Ramachandran submitted that the confession by the appellant was not voluntary but that it was a tutored statement to suit the b prosecution's case. The very language, tone and tenor of the confession showed that it was not voluntary in nature. There were many indicators in the confession itself showing that it was made at the instance of the investigating agency. Mr Ramachandran submitted that the confession was inordinately long and it was full of unnecessary details that were completely out of place, as those had no connection or relevance to the offences in regard to which the c confession was being made. The learned counsel pointed out that the confession started by giving the address of the village where the appellant was born and where he spent his childhood. The appellant then gave the names of his parents and the mobile phone number of his father; the names of his younger siblings who lived with his parents and those of his elder brother and sister who were married and lived at different places, along with d their addresses. After the names of the immediate family, he went on to give the names and addresses of his uncles and aunts and cousins, both on the paternal and maternal sides. Those were people whom the appellant had left long before joining the Lashkar-e- Toiba and taking on the mantel of a Jihadi. Mr Ramachandran submitted that there was no reason to mention all of them in a confession regarding the terrorist attack on Mumbai. He further pointed e out that the appellant seems to exhibit a phenomenal memory in the confessional statement, naming a large number of persons with their aliases and their home towns, with street names as well as the names given to them by the Jihadi group, along with the Hindu names assigned to them for the purpose of the attack on Mumbai. In regard to his visits to the different offices of the Lashkar-e- Toiba at different places, the appellant would f mention not only the mode of transport but also the time taken in travelling from one place to another. He would give the name of the person whom he met at the gate of the office and then of the person whom he met inside the office. He would say what was written on the slips of paper given by one office while sending him to the other office or training camp. According to Mr Ramachandran, all those details were quite unnecessary in a confession g and a person making a confession with regard to the Mumbai attack would normally not go into all those particulars on his own unless prompted by some external agency. 496. He further submitted that the confession as recorded by the Magistrate was too tightly organised, well-structured and properly sequenced to be the true and honest narrative of the appellant, who was merely a h semi-literate rustic.

He submitted that a person of the appellant's education, when making an oral confessional statement, was bound to slightly ramble and many parts in the narrative would be out of sequence, but that was not so in the appellant's confessional statement as produced before the court. 497. Mr Ramachandran next pointed out that there were certain words occurring in the confessional statement which could not possibly have been used by the appellant and which show that the confessional statement was not in his own words. For instance, he referred to the record of proceedings dated 18-2-2009, before the learned Magistrate, Mrs Sawant Wagule (PW 218), who recorded his confessional statement. The Magistrate asked ( vide Question 14) him the offence about which he wanted to make a confessional statement. In reply, the appellant is shown to have said that he wanted to make the confessional statement in connection with the fidayeen attack on Bombay by him along with his associates on 26-11-2008, as well as the \"sahzish\" behind the attack. Mr Ramachandran said that \"sahzish\" is an Urdu word which would be roughly translated into English as \"conspiracy\" but that it has negative connotations. To the appellant, the preparation and the training for launching the attack on India were a patriotic duty and not \"sahzish\". He also referred to the passage in the confession about the training camp at Muzaffarabad. In the confessional statement the appellant is shown to have described Muzaffarabad as being situated in \"POK\". Mr Ramachandran submitted that for the appellant, unlike for an Indian, this region was not \"POK\" (Pakistan Occupied Kashmir) but rather it was \"Azad Kashmir\", and contended that the appellant could not have used the words \"sahzish\" or \"POK\" and several other similar words that occur in his confessional statement. 498. Mr Ramachandran further submitted that operations of the kind in which the appellant was involved work strictly on a \"need-to-know basis\", such that individual operatives are given information limited to what is essential for execution of the role assigned to them. This is for their own safety and for the safety of the larger group, as also for the success of the conspiracy. But in this case it would appear that, in the course of his training, the appellant was being freely introduced to all and sundry in the organisation and was also told about their respective positions in the hierarchy of the organisation and their special skills. As an instance, Mr Ramachandran referred to the passage in the confessional statement where the appellant is taken to the media room of the organisation and Kafa tells him about Zarar Shah being the head of the media wing of the organisation. 499. Mr Ramachandran pointed out that the appellant describes a number of events in the course of his training in Pakistan in the minutest detail. He not only recalls what someone said at that time but actually reproduces long statements made by someone else in direct speech, which is recorded by the ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The learned counsel submitted that this feature of the confessional statement was itself sufficient to discredit it. 500. Mr Ramachandran further pointed out that, at several places, in a course of some discussion in a group, the appellant asks a question to elicit an answer that would fit exactly into the prosecution's case. Mr Ramachandran submitted that, if viewed objectively, those parts of the confession would appear quite out of place and contrived. He also referred to some other passages in the confessional statement, like the one where the members of the terrorist squad are told that the SIM cards for their mobile b phones were procured from India by fooling some people there, and characterised these passages as quite contrived and out of place. 501. Mr Ramachandran further submitted that the introduction of Fahim and Sabauddin (Accused 2 and 3) with the maps allegedly prepared by them, in the confessional statement, was clearly fabricated. He said that the other two accused were mentioned in the confession at three places and at each c place the reference appeared to be more incongruous than at the other. 502. Mr Ramachandran submitted that, beginning from the Kuber right up to his being taken into custody at Vinoli Chowpaty, the appellant seems to be narrating events so as to confirm all the findings of the investigation. Mr Ramachandran referred to the passage where Abu Ismail and the appellant proceed in the Skoda car, having snatched the vehicle from its d owner at gunpoint. At this point, the appellant asks Abu Ismail where they are going and Abu Ismail vaguely replies that they are going to Malabar Hill and, on being asked again, tells the appellant that he would tell him the exact destination only after reaching Malabar Hill. And then, as they pass through the road by the sea, the appellant recalls that this was the same road as was shown in the maps prepared by the other two accused, as going towards Malabar Hill. e Mr Ramachandran said that if Malabar Hill was actually the area they were headed for, it is impossible to believe that he would not know their exact target there, or that Abu Ismail would hold it back from him till they reached there. The learned counsel contended that the whole passage was clearly an untrue insertion for filling up the blanks in the prosecution case. f 503. Mr Ramachandran also ref erred to two other passages in the confession, one relating to the terrorists' encounter with two persons as they came ashore at Badhwar Park, and the other regarding the appellant's planting of an RDX bomb in the taxi by which the appellant and Abu Ismail came to CST. Mr Ramachandran submitted that the first passage was intended to prop up the evidence of Bharat Dattatrya Tamore (PW 28), who was just a chance witness and whose credibility was otherwise wholly g unsupported; and the other passage was to foist the killings in the taxi blast at Vile Parle on the appellant, for which also there was otherwise no evidence. 504. Mr Ramachandran further submitted that the appellant had wanted to make a confession as soon as he was apprehended (see his answer to Question 9 by the Magistrate in the record of proceedings dated 18-2-2009, before Mrs Sawant Wagule, PW 218).

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA ( Aftab Alam, J.) 195 realised in the first week of December, 2008 that the appellant was willing to give a confession before a Magistrate (vide Para 25 of his deposition before the court). And yet, he was brought before the Magistrate for making the confession as late as 17-2-2009. That the appellant was produced before the Magistrate only after the investigation was complete is evident from the fact that the recording of the confession was completed on 21-2-2009, and the charge-sheet was filed on 25-2-2009. Mr Ramachandran submitted that after the investigation was over, the police wanted the appellant to confirm all the findings made in course of the investigation and that the appellant was produced before the Magistrate with that objective. 505. Mr Ramachandran submitted that for the reasons pointed out by him, this Court should keep the appellant's confessional statement completely out of consideration. And if the confessional statement is put aside then his conviction, at least for the murder committed on the Kuber and the killings in the Vile Parle taxi blast, cannot be sustained. 506. We have read the appellant's confession a number of times in light of its denunciation by Mr Ramachandran as not being a voluntary statement. But we find it impossible to hold that the confession is not voluntary and is liable to be thrown out for that reason. Indeed, some of the criticisms by Mr Ramachandran appear, at first sight , quite convincing, but a little reflection would show that there is not much force in any of those criticisms. Before proceeding further, however, we may state that his censure regarding the mentions of the other two accused in the confessional statement is quite justified, and we too find the references to Accused 2 and 3 at three (3) places in the confessional statement highly unsatisfactory. We are also of the view that the reference to their destination being Malabar Hills when Abu Ismail and the appellant were caught at Vinoli Chowpaty is equally vague, and that also is perhaps mentioned to establish a connection with the alleged maps prepared by Accused 2 and 3. But so far as the rest of the very detailed confession is concerned, there is absolutely no reason to doubt that it was made voluntarily and without any influence or duress from any external agency. 507. Taking Mr Ramachandran's criticisms one by one, the detailed references by the appellant to his parents and a larger number of his relatives, their addresses and the mobile phone numbers of some of them, and his references to the different places in Pakistan, appears to us to be directed against the Pakistani authorities. It is the appellant's assertion, made consciously or subconsciously, of his Pakistani identity and nationality. It is noted above that, shortly after his anest, he had sent two letters ( one undated, handed over to Marde; the other dated 26-12-2008, and handed over to the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate; both addressed to the Pakistani High Commission asking for a Pakistani lawyer). Those two letters were not even acknowledged and, for all intents and purposes, he was disowned by the country to which he belongs. Thus, in the statement that he made before the Magistrate on 20-2-2009, the appellant was making it clear that he was a Pakistani by birth and by citizenship, and was making assertions that no one could deny. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 196 SUPREME COURT CASES (2012) 9 sec 508. Proceeding to the structure of the statement the sequence of events narrated therein and the use of some words that prima facie seem unnatural in his mouth. It needs to be kept in mind that the appellant was making the statement after being in police custody for several months. The police, in the course of countless sessions of interrogations, would have turned him inside out, and he would have earlier made the very same statements in the same sequence before the police many a times. Under relentless police interrogations, he would have recalled the smallest details of his past life, specially relating to the preparation and training for the attack on Mumbai. (The statements made before the police were not, however, admissible in evidence as being barred by the various provisions of CrPC and the Evidence Act, as discussed in detail above.) But when the appellant went to the Magistrate to make his confession, everything would be completely fresh in his mind. He would also have unconsciously picked up those words pointed out by Mr Ramachandran from his interrogators, and these would have become part of his own vocabulary. We, therefore, find nothing surprising in his uttering words like \"sahzish\" or \"POK\". 509. As to his knowing the names of many people in Lashkar-e-Toiba, their respective positions in the hierarchy and their roles in the organisation, again there is nothing unusual about it. It is to be noted that the appellant was not a mercenary hired for the operation. He was a highly committed and devoted member of the organisation and, therefore, there is nothing strange or wrong in his coming to know many people in the organisation during the course of his training. Further, it is to be kept in mind that his being caught alive was not part of the plan of the handlers. According to the plan, he, like the other nine terrorists in the team, was supposed to die in the course of the attack, and with his death everything would have remained unknown. 102 It was only thanks to the fact of his being caught alive (which, as the phone transcripts indicate, made his handlers quite anxious) that the Indian authorities were able to learn the names of the other people in the organisation, their specific roles and their positions in the organisation. As to the recording of certain statements within quotes by the learned Magistrate, that is only a manner of how the appellant spoke. The appellant would say a long sentence and then add that this was what so-and-so said. The Magistrate would then record the statement within inverted commas even though the sentences would be made by the appellant himself, paraphrasing the words of others. Further, to say that the confessional statement was intended to confirm the findings of the police investigation is actually to blame the police for an excellent investigation. If the confessional statement confirms the findings of the investigation that should go to the credit of the investigation, and it cannot be said that the confessional statement was recorded to confirm the police investigation. 102 We may recall here the injunction by the collaborators to the terrorists against being caught alive as appearing in the transcripts of their phone calls. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MOHD. AJMAL AMIR KASAB v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA ( Aftab Alam, J) 197 510. Finally, the production of the accused before the Magistrate on 17-2-2009, even though he had expressed his willingness to make the confessional statement in early December 2008, is equally legitimate and understandable. The police could not afford to lose custody of the appellant at that stage, as it was essential in connection with their investigation, which was still incomplete to a very large extent at that time. Once the appellant was produced for recording of the confession under Section 164 CrPC, the law ordained the Magistrate to send him to judicial custody and not back on police remand. In those circumstances, the police was fully justified in producing the appellant for confession only after completing its own investigation, when it no longer needed the appellant in its custody. 511. Leaving aside Mr Ramachandran's criticisms, the proof of the voluntariness and the truthfulness of the confessional statement comes directly from the appellant's own statements. It is noted in the earlier part of the judgment that, on 18-2-2009, when the appellant was brought before the Magistrate, she asked him when he first felt like making a confession, to which he had replied that the thought of making the confession came to him when he was arrested by the police; he then added that he had absolutely no regret for whatever he had done. At another stage in the proceedings, the Magistrate once again asked why he wished to make the confessional statement, to which he replied that he wanted to set an example for others to follow and to become fidayeen like him. It is thus clear that he was not making a confessional statement from any position of weakness or resignation, or out of remorse. He was a hero in his own eyes, and in those circumstances it is not possible to hold that the confession was not voluntary. It may further be noted that, though Mr Ramachandran questioned the voluntariness of the confession, he did not say that the statements made therein were untrue in any manner. 512. It needs to be noted here that, in the course of the trial, after fifty-eight (58) prosecution witnesses had been examined and the next witness, Police Sub-Inspector Chavan was about to enter the witness box on 20-7-2009, the appellant in the dock expressed a desire to have a word with his counsel. After a brief consultation that lasted for about half a minute, Mr Kazmi informed the court that the appellant wanted to say something to the court directly. On being asked to speak by the court, the appellant said that he was accepting his guilt. The Special Public Prosecutor objected to entertaining any plea of guilty at that stage, on the grounds that the stage of Section 229 CrPC was already over. The court, however, rightly overruling the objection, allowed the appellant to make a statement, which was recorded after giving him due caution. 513. This is once again a long statement but it does not have the organised structure that Mr Ramachandran pointed out in respect of the confessional statement recorded by the Magistrate. In his statement before the court the appellant began the story from CST Station, where both he and Abu Ismail fired from AK-47 rifles and Abu Ismail threw hand-grenades at a crowd of passengers. Starting from CST Station he went up to Vinoli ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 198 SUPREME COURT CASES (2012) 9 sec Chowpaty, where he and Abu Ismail were finally caught. From there, he went back to the point when they had started their sea journey from Karachi for Mumbai, recounting their journey first on the small boat, then on the larger a vessels Al-Hussaini and Kuber, until he came to the landing at Badhwar Park on the inflatable rubber boat. He then went back again to the various kinds of trainings that he had received at different places in Pakistan. However, what is of importance is that, though structurally and sequentially the statement made in the court is completely different from the confessional statement made before the Magistrate, it has broadly the same contents. It is true that in b the confessional statement he presents himself as the central figure in almost all the episodes while in the statement before the court he appears to be perceptibly retreating to the background. The lead role in and the overt acts are attributed to others rather than to himself. In all the offences that he committed in Mumbai along with Abu Ismail, it is now the latter who is in the lead and he himself is simply following behind him. The killing of c Amarchand Solanki on the boat Kuber that he owned up to almost with pride before the Magistrate is now assigned to Abu Soheb with Kasab not even present in the engine room. Significantly, however, as regards his joining of Lashkar-e-Toiba, the formation of the conspiracy, the preparation and training for the attack on Mumbai, as well as the identities of the men in the organisation, there is hardly any omission in the appellant's statement made d in the court. 514. Further, in the statement to the court, though there is mention of the hand-prepared maps, there is no mention of their source. There is no reference to Fahim and Sabauddin (Accused 2 and 3) as the maker and the deliverer (respectively) of those maps. 515. In the appellant's statement before the court there is no reference at all to his family but the reason for this is not far to seek. In Para 40 of the statement recorded by the court the appellant said as follows: \"I wanted to confess the offence. Since Pakistan had been disowning, I was not confessing. I have now learnt that Pakistan has accepted that I am Pakistani national and that they are ready to prosecute the offenders. Therefore, I am voluntarily confessing to the charges framed against me. I have made the statement voluntarily without being influenced by any extraneous source or reason.\" 516. His Pakistani identity and nationality having been acknowledged 103 there was no need for the appellant to remind the Pakistani establishment of his nationality by giving details of his family and their addresses. 517. The court, of course, did not accept the statement that was sought to be made as the plea of guilty because it was a very diluted and partial 103 On an enquiry made by the court as to how the appellant, being under judicial remand, came to learn that Pakistan had acknowledged him to be his national, it came to light that the appellant learnt about the fact from the guards on duty. Actually, on 12-2-2009, the Interior Minister of Pakistan acknowledged that the appellant is a citizen of Pakistan in a press conference. But the appellant came to know about it much later and used it as an excuse to make a statement before the court. e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

While dealing with the statements made by the appellant, it may also be noted that, finally, in the statement recorded under Section 313 CrPC, he denied the entire prosecution case and also retracted his two previous statements. It is evident that by the time the statement under Section 313 was recorded towards the end of December 2009, the Jihadi sheen had worn off and the desire to live was again exerting its pull on the appellant. b 519. In light of the discussions made above, we are unable to accept C d e f g h Mr Ramachandran's submission to eschew the appellant's confessional statement made before the Magistrate completely from consideration. We are clearly of the view that the confessional statement recorded by the Magistrate is voluntary and truthful, except insofar as it relates to the other two accused, namely, Fahim and Sabauddin. IV. Conspiracy 520. Mr Ramachandran submitted that the charge of conspiracy cannot be said to have been fully established against the appellant. He pointed out that the appellant was charged with a larger conspiracy and he was alleged to have: (1) Attempted to destabilise the Government of India by engineering violence in different parts in India; (2) Attempted to create instability in India by the aforesaid subversive activities; (3) Te1Torised the people in different parts of India by indulging in wanton killings and destruction of properties through bomb attacks and use of firearms and lethal weapons; (4) Conspired to weaken India's economic might; (5) Conspired to kill foreign nationals with a view to cause serious damage to tourism business of India; (6) Conspired to adversely affect harmony between various communities and religions in India. 521. The learned counsel submitted that if the appellant's confession is excluded from consideration there is not enough evidence brought by the prosecution to prove the aforesaid allegations beyond all reasonable doubts. He further submitted that the transcripts of the telephonic conversation which have been pressed by the prosecution to prove the charges relating to conspiracy cannot be used against the appellant. 522. We find no force in the submission. Earlier it is found that the confession by the appellant was quite voluntary and there was no violation of any constitutional or legal right of the appellant in the recording of the confession. Hence, there is no reason for not taking the confession into consideration to judge the charges against the appellant. Moreover, in the earlier pages of this judgment we had examined the evidence of conspiracy in ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 200 SUPREME COURT CASES (2012) 9 sec considerable detail, which may be broadly classified under three heads: (i) the confessional statement by the appellant; (ii) the objective findings in the vessel Kuber, the inflatable rubber dinghy, the different places of attack a by the other groups of terrorists and the locations of bomb explosion in the two taxis; and (iii) the transcripts of the phone conversations between the tenorists and their collaborators and handlers from across the border. In our view, evidence under any of these three heads is sufficient to bring home the charges relating to conspiracy against the appellant. 523. At this stage, however, we must address Mr Ramachandran's point b regarding the admissibility of the transcripts in evidence against the appellant. Mr Ramachandran submitted that the transcripts begin from 01.04 a.m. on 27-11-2008, whereas the appellant was taken into custody at 0030 hrs on that date. In other words, the transcripts begin after the appellant was in police custody. He contended that with the arrest of the appellant his link with the other alleged conspirators was snapped, and it could no longer be c said that he continued to be a part of the conspiracy. In that situation, the conversation among the alleged co-conspirators cannot be used against the appellant. In support of the submission, he placed reliance on a three-Judge Bench of this Court in State v. Nalini 104. We find no force or substance in the submission, and the reliance placed on the decision in Nalini 104 is quite misconceived. d 524. In Nalini 104, the Court was examining the question whether a confession made by an accused and recorded under Section 15 of TADA, though a substantive evidence against the maker thereof, could be used with the same force against a co-accused being tried in the same case. The Court considered the question first in light of the amendment of TADA by Act 43 of 1993, and came to hold and find that while a confession is substantive e evidence against its maker, it cannot be used as substantive evidence against another person, even if the latter is a co-accused, and can only be used as a piece of conoborative material to support other substantive evidence. The State then fell back on Section 10 of the Evidence Act, arguing that the width of the provision is so large as to render any statement made by a conspirator as substantive evidence if it satisfies the other conditions of the section. f Rejecting the State's submission, the Court pointed out that a confession can normally be made when an accused is under arrest and his contact with the other conspirators has snapped, and it was in that context that the Court held and observed in para 111 of the judgment as under: (Nalini case 104 , SCC p. 312) \"111. Whether a particular accused had ceased to be a conspirator or g not, at any point of time, is a matter which can be decided on the facts of that particular case. Normally a conspirator's connection with the conspiracy would get snapped after he is nabbed by the police and kept in their custody because he would thereby cease to be the agent of the other conspirators. Of course we are not unmindful of rare cases in which 104 (1999) 5 sec 253, para 111 : 1999 sec (Cri) 691 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (A/tab Alam, J) 201 a conspirator would continue to confabulate with the other conspirators and persist with the conspiracy even after his arrest. That is precisely the reason why we said that it may not be possible to lay down a proposition of law that one conspirator's connection with the conspiracy would necessarily be cut off with his arrest.\" 525. In the case in hand the situation is entirely different. The phase of planning the attack and training for it, which form the core of the conspiracy, took place in Pakistan, and the terrorists, including the appellant, came to Mumbai in execution of the main objects of the conspiracy. The appellant was apprehended while he was on a killing spree in execution of the objects of the conspiracy and the transcripts of the phone conversation of the other terrorists, associates of the appellant and their foreign collaborators, relate to a time when the speakers were not only free but were actively involved in trying to fulfil the objects of the conspiracy. The transcripts are by no means any confessional statements made under arrest and they are fully covered by the provisions of Section 10 of the Indian Evidence Act. There is no reason not to take them into consideration in support of the charge of conspiracy against the appellant. V. Waging war against the Government of India 526. The appellant has been convicted on the charge of waging war against the Government of India and is awarded the death penalty under Section 121 of the Penal Code. In addition, he is separately convicted, under Section 121-A, for conspiracy to commit offences punishable by Section 121 of the Penal Code and Section 122 for collecting arms, etc. with intention of waging war against the Government of India, and given life sentences under these two sections. Mr Ramachandran stated that the conviction under Section 121-A pertains to the incidents at venues where the appellant was not present, and in that regard he has already made his submissions while dealing with the question of conspiracy. In regard to the conviction under Section 121, therefore, he would confine his submissions to the offences directly attributable to the appellant. 527. Mr Ramachandran was anxious to somehow rescue the appellant from the grave charge of waging war against the Government of India. His anxiety in regard to this particular charge stems from the fact that the conviction for the offence of \"waging war\" has been viewed by the High Court as the most aggravating factor for awarding the death sentence to the appellant. Mr Ramachandran evidently hoped that if he succeeded in getting the appellant acquitted of the charge of \"waging war\" he would be in a better position to plead before the Court for mitigation of the punishment and commutation of his sentence to life imprisonment. 528. Mr Ramachandran argued that killing of people, even though in large numbers, within the precincts of CST, or the other offences committed by the appellant, earlier described under the heads \"Cama in\", \"Cama out\", \"Skoda robbery\" and \"Vinoli Chowpaty\", by no means amount to \"waging ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

To constitute the offence of \"waging war\", there must be a challenge to the sovereign authority of the Government of India, which is completely absent in the present case. a The learned counsel submitted that the acts said to have been committed by the appellant may constitute a terrorist act within the meaning of Section 15 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, but not \"waging war\". He further submitted that if the views of the trial court and the High Court were to be upheld, it would amount to equating every terrorist act with waging war. b 529. Mr Ramachandran submitted that even assuming that the words \"Government of India\" in Section 121 of the Penal Code are to be read as synonymous with the Indian State, that would not make the attack on CST Station \"waging war\" within the meaning of that section. The attack on CST was not an attack directly targeting any important symbol of the State or any vital establishment of the State or any important functionaries of the State. c The intent to weaken or terrorise the State may render such an act a \"terrorist act\" but it would still not satisfy the ingredients of Section 121 of the Penal Code. The learned counsel went on to contend that, in any event, after the enactment of the very comprehensive provisions in Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, the provisions of Section 121 of the Penal Code would cease to apply to terrorist attack on the Indian State on d principles analogous to those governing the implied repeal of statute. 530. Mr Ramachandran further submitted that, similarly, the mindless killing of persons in a public place would not constitute the offence of \"waging war\" against the Indian State. Any argument that an attack on a place which is no more than the hub of a public transportation system e amounts to an attack on the State is, according to Mr Ramachandran, quite fallacious in the context of a criminal statute. The learned counsel submitted that to say that an attack on a very important and busy railway station or an attack on India's financial capital or economic might would be an attack on the State would amount to giving a greatly extended, expansive and liberal meaning to a criminal statute , which is not permissible. f 531. Mr Ramachandran further submitted that on the question of \"waging war\" the present case was not comparable to the cases of Navjot Sandhu 74 and Mohd. Arif v. State (NCT of Delhi) 105 . In Navjot Sandhu 74 and Mohd. Arij10 5 , the targets of attack were the Parliament building and the Red Fort , which this Court held were clearly symbols of the Indian State and its sovereignty. According to Mr Ramachandran, the same could not be said of g CST, which is only a public building. 532. The offences concerning \"waging war\" are in Chapter VI of the Penal Code under the heading \"Of Offences Against the State\" . Section 121 uses the phrase \"Government of India\" and it provides as follows: 74 State (NCTof Delhi) v.

Section 121-A makes a conspiracy to commit offences punishable by Section 121 per se an offence punishable with imprisonment for life or for a period that may extend to ten (10) years. The Explanation to the section makes it clear that the offence is complete even without any act or illegal omission occurring in pursuance of the conspiracy. This section uses the expression \"the Central Government or any State Government\". The section reads as under: \"121-A. Conspiracy to commit offences punishable by Section 121.- Whoever within or without India conspires to commit any of the offences punishable by Section 121, or conspires to overawe, by means of criminal force or the show of criminal force, the Central Government or any State Government , shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.-To constitute a conspiracy under this section , it is not necessary that any act or illegal omission shall take place in pursuance thereof.\" 534. Section 122 similarly makes collection of arms with intention of \"waging war\" per se an offence, regardless of whether or not the arms were put to actual use. This section again uses the expression \"Government of India\" and it reads as under: \"122. Collecting anns, etc., with intention of waging war against the Government of India.-Whoever collects men , arms or ammunition or otherwise prepares to wage war with the intention of either waging or being prepared to wage war against the Government of India, shall be punished with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\" 535. Section 123 deals with \"Concealing with intent to facilitate design to wage war against the Government of India\". Section 125 deals with \"Waging war against any Asiatic Power in alliance with the Government of India\", and Section 126 deals with \"Committing depredation on territories of Power at peace with the Government of India\". 536. Here it may also be noted that Section 39 CrPC read with Section 176 of the Penal Code makes it an offence for any person who is aware of the commission of, or of the intention of any person to commit, an offence under Sections 121 to 126, both inclusive (that is, offences against the State specified in Chapter VI of the Code), to omit giving any notice or furnishing any information to any public servant. Moreover, Section 123 of the Penal Code makes it an offence to conceal, whether by act or omission, the existence of a design to \"wage war\" against the Government of India, when intending by such concealment to facilitate, or knowing it to be likely that such concealing will facilitate, the waging of such war. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In its narrower sense, the Government of India is only the executive limb of the State. It comprises a a group of people, the administrative bureaucracy that controls the executive functions and powers of the State at a given time. Different Governments, in continuous succession, serve the State and provide the means through which the executive power of the State is employed. The expression \"Government of India\" is surely not used in this narrow and restricted sense in Section 121. In our considered view, the expression \"Government of India\" is used in b Section 121 to imply the Indian State, the juristic embodiment of the sovereignty of the country that derives its legitimacy from the collective will and consent of its people. The use of the phrase \"Government of India\" to signify the notion of sovereignty is consistent with the principles of Public International Law, wherein sovereignty of a territorial unit is deemed to vest in the People of the territory and exercised by a representative Government. c 538. It is important to note here that earlier the word used in Section 121 (as well as all the other sections referred to above) was \"Queen\". After the formation of the Republic under the Constitution it was substituted by the expression \"Government of India\" by the Adaption of Laws Order of 1950. In a Republic, sovereignty vests in the People of the country and the lawfully elected Government is simply the representative and a manifestation of the d sovereign, that is, the People. Thus, the expression \"Government of India\", as appearing in Section 121, must be held to mean the State or interchangeably the People of the country as the repository of the sovereignty of India which is manifested and expressed through the elected Government. 539. An illuminating discussion on the issue of \"Waging war against the Government of India\" is to be found in this Court's decision in Navjot e Sandhu 74 . In para 272 of the judgment, P. Venkatarama Reddi, J., speaking for the Court, ref erred to the Report of the Indian Law Commission that examined the draft Penal Code in 184 7 and quoted the following passage from the Report: (SCC p. 767) \"272 . ... 'We conceive the term \"wages war against the Government\" naturally to import a person arraying himself in defiance of the Government in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy would do, and it seems to us, we presume it did to the authors of the Code that any definition of the term so unambiguous would be superfluous.\" ( emphasis supplied) f 540. To us, the expression, \"in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy\" (highlighted by us in the above quotation), is very significant g to understand the nature of the violent acts that would amount to waging war. In \"waging war\", the intent of the foreign enemy is not only to disturb public peace or law and order or to kill many people. A foreign enemy strikes at the sovereignty of the State, and his conspiracy and actions are motivated by that ammus. 74 State (NCT of Delhi) v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MOHD. AJMALAMIR KASAB v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 205 541. In Navjot Sandhu 74, the issue of \"waging war\" against the Government of India has also been considered in relation to terrorist acts and in that regard the Court observed and held as follows: (SCC pp. 767-68, paras 275-78) \"275. War, terrorism and violent acts to overawe the established Government have many things in common. It is not too easy to distinguish them .... 276. It has been aptly said by Sir J.F. Stephen: ' ... Unlawful assemblies, riots, insurrections, rebellions, levying of war are offences which run into each other and not capable of being marked off by perfectly definite boundaries. All of them have in common one feature, namely, that the normal tranquillity of a civilised society is, in each of the cases mentioned, disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it.' 106 277. To this list has to be added 'terrorist acts' which are so conspicuous nowadays. Though every terrorist act does not amount to waging war, certain terrorist acts can also constitute the offence of waging war and there is no dichotomy between the two. Terrorist acts can manifest themselves into acts of war. According to the learned Senior Counsel for the State, terrorist acts prompted by an intention to strike at the sovereign authority of the State/Government, tantamount to waging war irrespective of the number involved or the force employed. 278. It is seen that the first limb of Section 3(1) of POTA- '3. (l)(a) with intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological or otherwise) of a hazardous nature or by any other means whatsoever .... ' and the acts of waging war have overlapping features. However, the degree of animus or intent and the magnitude of the acts done or attempted to be done would assume some relevance in order to consider whether the terrorist acts give rise to a state of war. Yet, the demarcating line is by no means clear, much less transparent. It is often a difference in degree. The distinction gets thinner if a comparison is made of terrorist acts with the acts aimed at overawing the Government by means of criminal force. Conspiracy to commit the latter offence is covered by Section 121-A.\" 542. This answers Mr Ramachandran's submissions to the effect that if an offence comes within the definition of \"terrorist act\" under Section 15 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, it would automatically fall out of Section 121 of the Penal Code, as also his rather extreme submission that the 74 State (NCT of Delhi) v.

As explained in Navjot Sandhu 74 , a \"terrorist act\" and an act of \"waging war a against the Government of India\" may have some overlapping features, but a terrorist act may not always be an act of waging war against the Government of India, and vice versa. The provisions of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and those of Chapter VI of the Penal Code, including Section 121, basically cover different areas. 543. Coming back to the facts of the case in hand, we find that the b primary and the first offence that the appellant and his co-conspirators committed was the offence of waging war against the Government of India. It does not matter that the target assigned to the appellant and Abu Ismail was CST Station (according to Mr Ramachandran, no more than a public building) where they killed a large number of people or that they killed many others on Badruddin Tayabji Marg and in Cama Hospital. What matters is c that the attack was aimed at India and Indians. It was by foreign nationals. People were killed for no other reason than they were Indians; in case of foreigners, they were killed because their killing on Indian soil would embarrass India. The conspiracy, in furtherance of which the attack was made, was, inter alia, to hit at India; to hit at its financial centre; to try to give d rise to communal tensions and create internal strife and insurgency; to demand that India should withdraw from Kashmir; and to dictate its relations with other countries. It was in furtherance of those objectives that the attack was made, causing the loss of a large number of people and injury to an even greater number of people. Nothing could have been more \"in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy would do\". e 544. In this connection Mr Gopal Subramanium has referred to the transcripts of the conversations between the terrorists and their collaborators across the border. The learned counsel referred from the appellant's confessional statement made before the Magistrate to the passages where instructions are given by Amir Hafiz Sayeed (wanted Accused 1), Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi (wanted Accused 2), and others in connection with f the main purpose of the attack. He also referred to a number of passages from the transcripts of conversations between the terrorists and their collaborators across the border (which we have already referred to in the earlier part of the judgment), to show that the attack was clearly an enemy action. We are of the view that the submission of Mr Subramanium is well founded and fit to be accepted. g 545. On a careful consideration of the submissions of the two sides and the materials on record we have no hesitation in holding that the appellant has been rightly held guilty of waging war against the Government of India and rightly convicted under Sections 121, 121-A and 122 of the Penal Code. 74 State (NCT of Delhi) v.

The trial court has awarded five (5) death sentences to the appellant a for the offences punishable under: (i) Section 120-B IPC read with Section 302 IPC for conspiracy to commit murder; (ii) Section 121 IPC for waging war against the Government of India; (iii) Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967; b (iv) Section 302 IPC for committing murder of 7 persons; C d e f g h (v) Section 302 IPC read with Section 34 and Section 302 IPC read with Sections 109 and 120-B IPC. 547. The High Court confirmed the death sentences given to the appellant by the trial court. 548. Mr Ramachandran, however, submitted that in no case should the appellant be given the death penalty. The learned counsel submitted that no person can be deprived of his life except according to procedure established by law. It is now well established that the \"procedure\" must be fair, just and reasonable, in other words following the \"due process of law\". Hence, the Court must refrain from awarding the extreme penalty of death, irrevocable and irreversible in nature, in a case where there is the slightest doubt regarding the complete fairness of the trial. The learned counsel submitted that the appellant's trial was compromised on due process and, therefore, he should not be given the death sentence. 549. Mr Ramachandran's contention that the trial of the appellant was less than completely fair is based on the same grounds that he earlier advanced to suggest that the trial was vitiated and nullified. He submitted that the appellant's confession was recorded without adhering to the constitutional safeguards and that the lawyer nominated to represent him was not given a reasonable time to prepare the case. The learned counsel submitted that an unhappy compromise was struck between the demands of speedy trial and the requirements of a fair trial in this case, and in that situation, prudence would demand that this Court should not confirm the death penalty given to the appellant but change it to life sentence. 550. In the earlier parts of the judgment we have already considered in detail both the submissions and found them not worthy of acceptance. We have held that there was no lowering of the standard of fairness and reasonableness in the appellant's trial and it, therefore, follows that no mitigation in punishment can be asked for on that score. 551. Mr Ramachandran next submitted that the High Court has committed a serious error in balancing the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances against the appellant. The High Court has viewed the appellant's conv1ct1on for \"waging war\" as the most aggravating circumstance for awarding him the death penalty after wrongly holding him guilty of the charge relating to waging war against the Government of India. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The High Court erroneously relied upon the testimony of a single a witness (PW 52) who said that while firing at the crowd of passengers at CST the appellant was in a \"joyous mood\" (a fact which the witness did not mention in his statement before the police). 552. As to the charge of waging war against the Government of India and the appellant being personally responsible for the killing of seven (7) people, including Amarchand Solanki, those are fully in accord with our own b findings, arrived at independently, and hence , the High Court was quite justified in taking those facts into account for determining the punishment for the appellant. As regards the statement of PW 52 that the appellant was in \"joyous mood\", nothing depends on that and we asked Mr Ramachandran to address us on the issue of sentence keeping that statement by PW 52 C completely aside. 553. Mr Ramachandran submitted that the strongest reason for not giving the death penalty to the appellant was his young age; the appellant was barely twenty-one (21) years old at the time of the commission of the offences. And now he would be twenty-five (25) years of age. It is indeed conect that the appellant is quite young, but having said that one would think that nothing d was left to be said for him. Mr Ramachandran, however, thinks otherwise and he has many more things to say in the appellant's favour. Mr Ramachandran submitted that the Court cannot ignore the family and educational background and the economic circumstances of the appellant, and in determining the just punishment to him the Court must take those, too, into account. The learned counsel submitted that here is a boy who, as a child, e loved to watch Indian movies. But he hardly had a childhood like other children. He dropped out of school after Class IV and was forced to start earning by hard manual labour. Soon thereafter, he had a quarrel with his father over his earnings and that led to his leaving his home. At that immature age, living away from home and family and earning his livelihood by manual labour, he was allured by a group of fanatic murderers seemingly engaged in f social work. He thought that he too should contribute towards helping the Kashmiris, who he was led to believe were oppressed by the Indian Government . Mr Ramachandran submitted that, seen from his point of view, the appellant may appear completely and dangerously wayward but his motivation was good and patriotic. Mr Ramachandran further submitted that once trapped by Lashkar-e-Toiba he was completely brainwashed and g became a tool in their hand. While executing the attack on Mumbai, along with nine (9) other terrorists, the appellant was hardly in control of his own mind. He was almost like an automaton working under remote control, a mere extension of the deadly weapon in his hands. 554. Mr Ramachandran submitted that, viewed thus, it would appear h wholly unjust to give the death penalty to the appellant.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 209 should be kept reserved for his handlers, who, unfortunately, are not before a court till now. If the submission of Mr Ramachandran is taken one step further it would almost appear as if it was a conspiracy by destiny that pushed the appellant to commit all his terrible deeds, and all those who were killed or injured in Mumbai were predestined to be visited by his violence. We have no absolute belief in the philosophical doctrine of predetermination and, therefore, we are completely unable to accept Mr Ramachandran's submission. In this proceeding before this Court we must judge the actions of the appellant and the offences committed by him as expressions of his free will, for which he alone is responsible and must face the punishment. 555. We are unable to accept the submission that the appellant was a mere tool in the hands of the Lashkar-e-Toiba. He joined the Lashkar-e-Toiba around December 2007 and continued as its member till the end, despite a number of opportunities to leave it. This shows his clear and unmistakable intention to be a part of the organisation and participate in its designs. Even after his arrest he regarded himself as a \"watan parast'', a patriotic Pakistani at war with this country. Where is the question of his being brainwashed or acting under remote control? We completely disagree that the appellant was acting like an automaton. During the past months while we lived through this case we have been able to make a fair assessment of the appellant's personality. It is true that he is not educated but he is a very good and quick learner, has a tough mind and strong determination. He is also quite clever and shrewd. 107 Unfortunately, he is wholly remorseless and any feeling of pity is unknown to him. He kills without the slightest twinge of conscience. Leaving aside all the massacre, we may here refer only to the casualness with which the appellant and his associate Abu Ismail shot down Gupta Bhelwala and the shanty-dwellers Thakur Waghela and Bhagan Shinde at Badruddin Tayabji Marg; the attempt to break into the wards of Cama Hospital to kill the women and children who were crying and wailing inside; and the nonchalance with which he and Abu Ismail gunned down the Police Officer Durgude on coming out of Cama Hospital. 556. The saddest and the most disturbing part of the case is that the appellant never showed any remorse for the te1Tible things he did. As seen earlier, in the initial weeks after his a1Test he continued to regard himself as a \"watan parast\", a patriotic Pakistani who considered himself to be at war with this country, who had no use for an Indian lawyer but needed a Pakistani lawyer to defend him in the court. He made the confessional statement before the Magistrate on 17-2-2009, not out of any sense of guilt or so1Tow or grief but to present himself as a hero. He told the Magistrate that he had absolutely no regret for whatever he had done and he wanted to make the confession to set an example for others to become fidayeen like him and follow him in his 107 Recall here the \"plea of guilty\" statement made by him in the midst of his trial. In this statement he artfully and very subtly changed his earlier statement, recorded under Section 164 CrPC, thus cleverly offering himself for conviction but trying to escape the extreme penalty. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The Judge trying him had occasion to watch him closely and has repeatedly observed about the lack of any remorse on the part a of the appellant. The High Court, too, has noticed that the appellant never showed any remorse for the large-scale murder committed by him. This, to our mind, forecloses the possibility of any reform or rehabilitation of the appellant. The alternative option of life sentence is thus unquestionably excluded in the case of the appellant and death remains the only punishment that can be given to him. b 557. Coming back to the legalese of the matter: The constitutional validity of death penalty was tested in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab 108 and in that case a Constitution Bench of this Court, while upholding the constitutional validity of death sentence, observed that the death penalty may be invoked only in the rarest of rare cases. This Court stated that: (SCC p. 751, para 209) \"209. . .. for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception. A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law's instrumentality. That ought not to be done save in the rarest of rare cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed.\" ( emphasis supplied) 558. The Bachan Singh principle of the \"rarest of rare cases\" came up for consideration and elaboration in Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab 109. It was a case of extraordinary brutality (from normal standards but nothing compared to this case!). On account of a family feud Machhi Singh, the main accused in the case along with eleven (11) accomplices, in the course of a single night, conducted raids on a number of villages killing seventeen (17) people, men, women and children, for no reason other than they were related to one Amar Singh and his sister Piyaro Bai. The death sentence awarded to Machhi Singh and two other accused by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court was also confirmed by this Court. 559. In Machhi Singh 109 this Court observed that though the \"community\" revered and protected life because \"the very humanistic edifice is constructed on the foundation of reverence for life principle\" it may yet withdraw the protection and demand death penalty. The kind of cases in which protection to life may be withdrawn and there may be the demand for death penalty were then enumerated in the following paragraphs: (SCC pp. 487-89, paras 32-37) \"32 . ...

(ii) when the victim is subjected to inhuman acts of torture or cruelty in order to bring about his or her death. (iii) when the body of the victim is cut into pieces or his body is dismembered in a fiendish manner. II. Motive for commission of murder 34. When the murder is committed for a motive which evinces total depravity and meanness. For instance when (a) a hired assassin commits murder for the sake of money or reward, (b) a cold-blooded murder is committed with a deliberate design in order to inherit property or to gain control over property of a ward or a person under the control of the murderer or vis-a-vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position or in a position of trust, or (c) a murder is committed in the course of betrayal of the motherland. Ill. Anti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime 35. (a) When murder of a member of a Scheduled Caste or minority community, etc., is committed not for pe r sonal reasons but in circumstances which arouse social wrath. For instance when such a crime is committed in order to terrorise such persons and frighten them into fleeing from a place or in order to deprive them of, or make them surrender, lands or benefits conferred on them with a view to reverse past injustices and in order to restore the social balance. (b) In cases of 'bride burning' and what are known as 'dowry deaths' or when murder is committed in order to remarry for the sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry another woman on account of infatuation. N Magnitude of crime 36. When the crime is enormous in proportion. For instance when multiple murders say of all or almost all the members of a family or a large number of persons of a particular caste, community, or locality, are committed. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

When the victim of murder is (a) an innocent child who could not have or has not provided even an excuse, much less a provocation, for a murder ( b) a helpless woman or a person rendered helpless by old age or infirmity (c) when the victim is a person vis-a-vis whom the murderer is in a position of domination or trust (d) when the victim is a public figure generally loved and respected by the community for the services rendered by him and the murder is committed for political or similar reasons other than personal reasons.\" b 560. The above principles in Macchi Singh case 109 are generally regarded by this Court as the broad guidelines for imposition of death sentence and have been followed by the Court in many subsequent decisions. 561. If we examine the present case in light of Machhi Singh 109 decision, it would not only satisfy all the conditions laid down in that decision for imposition of death sentence but also present several other features that could c not have been conceived of by the Court in Machhi Singh 109 . We can even say that every single reason that this Court might have assigned for confirming a death sentence in the past is to be found in this case in a more magnified way. 562. This case has the element of conspiracy as no other case. The d appellant was part of a conspiracy hatched across the border to wage war against the Government of India and lethal arms and explosives were collected with the intention of waging war against the Government of India. The conspiracy was to launch a murderous attack on Mumbai regarding it as the financial centre of the country; to kill as many Indians and foreign nationals as possible; to take Indians and foreign nationals as hostages for e using them as bargaining chip in regard to the tenorists' demands; and to try to incite communal strife and insurgency; all with the intent to weaken the country from within. 563. The case presents the element of previous planning and preparation as no other case. For execution of the conspiracy, the appellant and the nine (9) other dead accused, his accomplices, were given rigorous and extensive f training as combatants. The planning for the attack was meticulous and greatly detailed. The route from Karachi to Mumbai, the landing site at Mumbai, the different targets at Mumbai were all predetermined. The nature of the attack by the different teams of tenorists was planned and everyone was given clear instructions as to what they were supposed to do at their respective targets. All the tenorists, including the appellant, actually acted g according to the previous planning. A channel of communication between the attacking tenorists and their handlers and collaborators from across the border, based on advanced computer technology and procured through deception, was already arranged and put in place before the attack was launched. h 109 Machhi Sin gh v.

This case has the element of waging war against the Government of India and the magnitude of the war is of a degree as in no other case. And the appellant is convicted on the charge, among others, of waging war against the Government of India. 565. This case has shocked the collective conscience of the Indian people as few other cases have. 566. The number of persons killed and injured is not only staggeringly high but also as in no other or in extremely few cases. The terrorists killed one hundred and sixty-six (166) people and injured, often grievously, two hundred and thirty-eight (238) people. The dead included eighteen (18) policemen and other security personnel and twenty-six (26) foreign nationals. The injured included thirty-seven (37) policemen and other security personnel and twenty-one (21) foreign nationals. Of those dead, at least seven (7) were killed by the appellant personally, about seventy-two (72) were killed by him in furtherance of the common intention he shared with one Abu Ismail (deceased Accused 1), and the rest were victims of the conspiracy to which he was a party along with the nine (9) dead accused and thirty-five (35) other accused who remain to be apprehended and brought to court. 567. The number of policemen and members of security forces killed and injured in course of their duty by the appellant and his accomplice Abu Ismail and the eight (8) other co-conspirators would hardly find a match in any other cases. Tukaram Omble was killed by the appellant personally at Vinoli Chowpaty. Durgude, Hemant Karkare, Ashok Kamte, Vijay Salaskar and the other policemen in the Qualis van were killed jointly by the appellant and Abu Ismail. The policemen at Cama Hospital were injured, several of them grievously, jointly by the appellant and Abu Ismail. The rest of the policemen and law-enforcement officers, including the NSG Commando Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, were killed as part of the larger conspiracy to which the appellant was a party. 568. The loss of property caused by the attack is colossal, over rupees one hundred and fifty crores (Rs 150 crores), again of a scale as in no other case. 569. The offences committed by the appellant show a degree of cruelty, brutality and depravity as in very few other cases. 570. The appellant, as also the other nine (9) terrorists, his co- g conspirators, used highly lethal weapons such as AK-47 rifles, 9 mm pistols, and hand-grenades and RDX bombs. 571. As to the personality of the victims, all the persons killed/injured at CST Station, Badruddin Tayabji Marg and Cama Hospital were harmless, defenceless people. What is more, they did not even know the appellant and h the appellant too had no personal animus against them. He killed/injured them simply because they happened to be Indians. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It is already seen above that the appellant never showed any repentance or remorse, which is the first sign of any possibility of reform and rehabilitation. a 573. In short, this is a case of tenorist attack from across the border. It has a magnitude of unprecedented enormity on all scales. The conspiracy behind the attack was as deep and large as it was vicious. The preparation and training for the execution was as thorough as the execution was ruthless. In terms of loss of life and property, and more importantly in its traumatising b effect, this case stands alone, or it is at least the very rarest of rare cases to come before this Court since the birth of the Republic. Therefore, it should also attract the rarest of rare punishment. 574. Against all this, the only mitigating factor is the appellant's young age, but that is completely offset by the absence of any remorse on his part, and the resultant finding is that in his case there is no possibility of any c reformation or rehabilitation. 575. In the effort to have the appellant spared of the death penalty, Mr Ramachandran also relied upon several observations and remarks made by this Court in a number of judgments. He cited before the Court: (i) Mohd. Mannan v. State of Bihar 110 , (ii) Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of d Karnataka 111, (iii) Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra 112 , (iv) Mohd. Farooq Abdul Gafur v. State of Maharashtra 113 , (v) Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod v. State of Gujarat 114 , (vi) Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2) v. State of Gujarat 115 , (vii) Mulla v. State of U.P 116 , (viii) Dilip Premnarayan Tiwari v. State of Maharashtra 117 , (ix) Major R.S. Budhwar v. Union of India 118 and (x) State of Maharashtra v. Bharat e Chaganlal Raghani 1I9_ 576. The observations relied upon by Mr Ramachandran were made in the facts of those cases. As a matter of fact, in some of the cases relied upon by Mr Ramachandran, the Court actually confirmed the death penalty given to the accused. Moreover, the facts of those cases are totally incomparable to the facts of the case in hand, and those decisions are of no help to the f appellant. 577. Putting the matter once again quite simply, in this country death as a penalty has been held to be constitutionally valid, though it is indeed to be 110 (2011) 5 SCC 317, paras 23-24: (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 626 111 (2008) 13 sec 767 , paras 43, 48-53 : (2009) 3 sec (Cri) 113 g 112 (2009) 6 sec 498, paras 64-66, 71-72, 80-89 : (2009) 2 sec (Cri) 1150 113 (2010) 14 sec 641 : (2011) 3 sec (Cri) 867 114 (2009) 5 sec 740, paras 83-84, 107-110: (2009) 2 sec (Cri) 881 115 (2011) 2 sec 764 : (2011) 1 sec (Cri) 883 116 (2010) 3 sec 508, para 80 : (2010) 2 sec (Cri) 1150 117 (2010) 1 sec 775, paras 66-67 : (2010) 1 sec (Cri) 925 118 (1996) 9 sec 502, para 15 : 1996 sec (Cri) 1072 119 (2001) 9 SCC 1, paras 1 and 63: 2002 SCC (Cri) 377 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF MAHARASHTRA (Aftab Alam, J) 215 awarded in the \"rarest of rare cases when the alternative option (of life sentence) is unquestionably foreclosed\". Now, as long as the death penalty remains on the statute book as punishment for certain offences, including \"waging war\" and murder, it logically follows that there must be some cases, howsoever rare or one in a million, that would call for inflicting that penalty. That being the position we fail to see what case would attract the death penalty, if not the case of the appellant. To hold back the death penalty in this case would amount to obdurately declaring that this Court rejects death as lawful penalty even though it is on the statute book and held valid by the Constitutional Benches of this Court. 578. We are thus left with no option but to hold that in the facts of the case the death penalty is the only sentence that can be given to the appellant. We hold accordingly and affirm the convictions and sentences of the appellant passed by the trial court and affirmed 1 by the High Court. 579. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. Criminal Appeal No. 1961 of 2011 580. This appeal is filed at the instance of the State of Maharashtra against the acquittal of Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahamed (Accused 2 and 3 respectively) recorded by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court. As noted, in the judgment in Criminal Appeals Nos. 1899-900 of 2011, these two accused faced the trial along with and on the same charges as Kasab. 581. Their connection with the other accused in the case, according to the prosecution, was through conspiracy. Fahim Ansari is said to have prepared, by hand, maps of various places of Mumbai to facilitate the attack by the terrorists who landed in the city. One such map was recovered from the trousers' pocket of Abu Ismail ( deceased Accused 1) during inquest and was seized under the seizure panchnama (Ext. 99). 582. According to the prosecution case, Fahim Ansari handed over the maps prepared by him to Sabauddin Ahamed in Kathmandu, Nepal and the latter sent or delivered those maps to the perpetrators of the crime 111 Pakistan. 583. This part of the prosecution case 1s based on the testimony of Naruddin Shaikh (PW 160). 584. It is further alleged that in order to provide ancillary logistical support to the terrorists landing in Mumbai, Fahim Ansari had made arrangements for his stay in Colaba area of South Mumbai. In order to stay in close proximity to Badhwar Park he was searching for a place of residence in fishermen's colony there and he had taken admission in a computer institute viz. \"Softpro Computer Education\" situated at Fort, Mumbai, as an excuse for staying in that area. 585. However, when the attack took place on 26-11-2008, neither Fahim Ansari nor Sabauddin Ahamed were present in Mumbai. They were in the custody of U.P. Police, having been arrested earlier in connection with a terrorist attack on the RPF Camp at Rampur. 1 State of Maharashtra v. Mohd.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 216 SUPREME COURT CASES (2012) 9 sec 586. In support of the second part of its case, the prosecution has examined a number of witnesses, namely, Police Inspector Prashant Marde (PW 48), Jivan Gulabkar (PW 35), Rajendra Bhosale (PW 38), Ms Shantabai a Bhosale (PW 40), Police Inspector Shripad Kale (PW 47), Jayant Bhosale (PW 146), Sharad Vichare (PW 265), Shivaji Shivekar (PW 14), API Subhash Warang (PW 27), Ashok Kumar Raghav (PW 213), Manpreet Vohra (PW 254 ), Krantikumar Varma ( PW 61) and Dr Shailesh Mohite ( PW 23 ). 587. We have gone through the evidence of Naruddin Shaikh and the other witnesses very carefully. We are of the view that the evidence of b Naruddin Shaikh is completely unacceptable. The evidences of the other witnesses also do not inspire confidence insofar as these two accused are concerned. 588. The trial court and the High Court have considered the evidences relating to these two accused in far greater detail. Both the courts have analysed the prosecution evidence in regard to the two accused at great c length and have given very good reasons to hold the prosecution evidence unworthy of reliance to hold such grave charges against the two accused. We are in full agreement with the reasons assigned by the trial court and the High Court for acquitting the two accused of all the charges. The view taken by the trial court and the High Court is not only correct but on the facts of the case, that is the only possible view. 589. We find no merit in the appeal and it is, accordingly, dismissed. Transfer Petition (Criminal) No. 30 of 2012 590. In view of the judgment in Criminal Appeals Nos. 1899-900 of 2011, the transfer petition does not survive and it is, accordingly, dismissed. The Postscript 591. The decision in the appeal is over. But there are still a few things for us to say before we finally close this matter. 592. At the beginning of the hearing of the appeal, Mr Gopal Subramanium avowed that, though appearing for the prosecution, he would like the best for the appellant. He wished that the case of the appellant be presented before the Court at the highest level and that it should receive the most careful scrutiny by the Court. The solemnity and sincerity of his declaration set the tone for the proceedings before the Court. The discourses were luminous, warm and stimulating but completely free from heat, rancour or anger, leave alone any vengefulness. Mr Subramanium, erudite and sensitive, was full of restraint; always downplaying the prosecution case a notch or two and never making a statement of fact unless absolutely certain of its correctness. Mr Ramachandran, cool and clinical, gently tried to persuade the Court to his point of view. In the course of the hearing of the case, which was spread over 13 weeks, not once were the voices raised, not once was the counsel of the other side interrupted and contradicted on a statement of fact. In my twenty years on the Bench I have not heard a serious case debated in such a congenial atmosphere as created by Mr Subramanium and Mr Ramachandran in this case. d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Mr Ramachandran, appearing for the appellant, was assisted by Mr Gaurav Agrawal and a small team of juniors. Mr Subramanium, representing the State of Maharashtra, was assisted by Mr Ujjawal Nikam, the Special Public Prosecutor who conducted the trial and a team of juniors. The juniors' teams also showed remarkable preparation and resourcefulness. Any query on facts was answered in no time with reference to volume number and page number from the records that appeared like a small mountain. We are indebted to Mr Subramanium and Mr Ramachandran and their respective teams and we put our gratitude on record. 594. In this case we came across heroes like Tukaram Omble, Hemant Karkare, Ashok Kamte, Vijay Salaskar and Sandeep Unnikrishnan, who lost their lives in the fight against terrorism. We salute every policeman, every member of the security forces and others who laid down their lives saving others and helping to catch or neutralise the ten terrorists. We have great admiration for the courage and sense of duty shown by the policemen and the members of the security forces who received injuries in discharge of their duties and we extend our deepest sympathies to them for their injuries. We compliment all those who showed great presence of mind and professionalism and, caring little for their own safety, saved countless lives or photographed the terrorists on their killing spree thus providing unimpeachable evidence for the court. We mourn the death of 148 civilians, both Indians and foreign nationals, who fell victim to the orgy of terror unleashed on the city, and extend our heartfelt condolences to their families. We also extend our deepest sympathies to all the 238 people who suffered injuries at the hands of the terrorists. We also greatly complement the resilient spirit of Mumbai that, to all outward appearances, recovered from the blow very quickly and was back to business as usual in no time. 595*. In the course of hearing of the appeal we also came to know the trial Judge Shri Tahiliani. From the records of the case he appears to be a stern, no-nonsense person. But he is a true flag-bearer of the rule of law in this country. The manner in which he conducted the trial proceedings and maintained the record is exemplary. We seriously recommend that the trial court records of this case be included in the curriculum of the National Judicial Academy and the Judicial Academies of the different States as a model for criminal trial proceedings. 596. We direct the Maharashtra Government to pay a sum of rupees eleven lakh (Rs 11 lakhs) to Mr Raju Ramachandran and rupees three lakh fifty thousand to Mr Gaurav Agrawal (Rs 3.5 lakhs) as token remuneration for their very valuable assistance to the Court. The payments should be made within two months from today.** 597. With this we come to the close of the matter and we end here. * Ed.: Para 595 corrected vide Order dated 3-10-2012 . ** Ed.: The learned Amicus Curiae have graciously declined to accept the same .

PRASAD, J. (supplementing)- I agree. However, I wish to add few words of my own. 602. In all human affairs absolute certainty is myth. Prof. Brett puts it, \"all exactness is fake\". Ordinarily, El Dorado theory of \"absolute proof' being unattainable, the law accepts for it probability as a working substitute. 603. Hardly one comes across a case, where the court does not resort to \"certain probability\" as working substitute for proof beyond all reasonable doubt. However, in the case in hand, from the evidence , oral and documentary, reference of which have copiou sly been made in the judgment by my noble and learned Brother Aftab Alam, J. make me believe that \"absolute certainty\" may not necessarily be a myth or fake in all cases and can be a reality. 604. The present case is an exception. Here, I am more than certain that the planning and conspiracy to commit the crime were hatched in Pakistan, the perpetrators of crime were Pakistani, trained at different centres in that country, and the devastation which took place at various places in the city of Mumbai, were executed by the appellant in furtherance thereof.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
