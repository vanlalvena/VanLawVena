Having the petitioners before him and having read to them the order under Section 112 it was his duty either to release them unconditionally or to ask them to give an interim bond for good conduct but only after he has started inquiring into the truth of the information . lt ,was for this reason that we held that the Magistrate did not act according to the law and his action after Aug~st 9, 1970 in detaining the petitioners in custody was illegal.

The reasons for these are as follows. (Para I) (ii) The Supreme Court is not prepared to hold now that the First Amendment was either not valid or not retrospective. The Court is also not prepared to reconsider the decision in 1.C. Golak Nath and Others v. State of Punjab and Another, ( 196 7) 2 SOR 762. (Para 2) (iii) The accepted fiction in the First Amendment is to make the Con- stitution be read with the new clause and no other, and a law restricting the freedoms in the interests of public order (among others) or in the in- terests of the general public must be held to be saved, not as a result of amendment, but because of these availdble restrictions operating from the inception of the Constitution. (Para 5) (iv) Therefore it is clear that the Court is only required to discus., whet- her the provisions of Section 144 and Chapter VIII of the Code can be said to be in the interests of public order in so far as the right of freedom of spe- ech and expression, rights of assembly, and formation of associations and uni- ons are concerned, and in the interests of general public in so far as they curt- ail freedom of movement throughout the territory of India. (a) Whether the decision in Babula[ Parata v. State of Mahara5htra, ( 1961) 3 SOR 423 which held Sec- tion 144 to be intra vires requires reconsideration arose before this spe- cial Bench.

( d) The areas of the two kinds of detention, one by Magistrates under the Code of Criminal Procedure, and-- another under laws for preventive detention under Article 22 of the Con- stitution are entirely different and therefore there is good classification.

So the matter must fall within the restrictions which the Constitution it- self visualises as permissible in the in- terest of public order or in the in- terests of the general public. (Para 24) (g) This Court is satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards avail- able to person affected by the order under Section 144 and the restrictions are reason '¼ble. The section is not unconstitutional if properly applied ahd the fact that it may be abused is no ground for striking down . The remedy then is to question the exercise of the power as being outside the grant of the law. (Para 28) (h) The constitutionality of Chap- ter VIII of the Code is also upheld for: (i) Division A (Section 106) is aimed ·at persons whose past conduct has proved dangerous to the public and is intended to secure public tran- quillity and peace. (ii) Division B (Sections 107-1 l0 and Sections 112-119) is also intra oires. As to Section 117 sub-section (i) contemplates an immediate inquiry into the truth of the information. It is pending the completion of the in- quiry that an interim bond can be asked for. As the liberty of the sub- ject is involved and the person is being proceeded with on information and suspicion it is necessary to put a strict construction of power of the Magis- trate. It is therefore necessary that 16me enquiry should be made before an interim bond is demanded. Relies : Nafa, Chandra Pal v. The King Emperor, 28 CWN 23; A .D Dunne v.

(iii] The power under Chapter VIII is to be distinguished from the power ef detention by executive action under Article 22.

Reasons are therefore to be stated by the Magis- trate when he passes the order. In this Court's judgement in writ petition 307 of 1970 it .is clearly stated that the case was simply adjourned often without any attempt before the remand which was clearly illegal. (iv) Division C of Chapter VIII (119-126-A) is quite intra vires. (v) There is nothing in Chapter, VIII that is contrary to Article 19 ( 1) (a), (b), (c) and (d) because the limits of the restr;ictions are well within clauses (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Article 19.

The Judgments of the Court were delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, C. J .-During the hearing of these petitions the constitu- tional validity of Section 144 and Chapter VIII of the Code of Criminal Pro- cedure was challenged a,d this Special B~nch was nominated to consider the issue. Lengthy argum ents were addressed to us by the petitioner and several interveners. The matter, as we shall show later, lies in a narrow compass. At the end of the arguments we announced our conclusion that the said provisions of the Code, properly understood, were not in excess of the limits laid down in the Constitution, for restricting the freedoms guaranteed by Article 19(1),(a),(b) (c) and (d). We reserved ou r reasons and now we proceed to give them. 2. We are required to test the impugned provisions against the first four sub-clauses of the first clause of the nineteenth Article. We may accordingly begin by reading the sub-clauses : '' 19. ( l) All citizens shall have the right- (a) to freedom of speech and expression ; (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms ; (c) to form associations or unions ; and (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India\" These sub-clauses deal with four distinct but loosely related topics. They pre- serve certain personal as well as group freedoms. They allow an individual freedom of speech and movement and as a member of a group (and for the group also) the same freedoms plus the right of assembly and formation of assosiations and unions. Although the guarantees appear to be in absolute terms, in reality they are not so. :\\ number of restricti\\\"e exceptions are en- grafted upon each of the f1 eedom previously guaranteed . The restrictions are contained in clauses. (2), (3), (4), and (5) and a1·e related respectively to sub- clauses (a), {b), (c) and (d) of the first clause. Clause (5) covers sub- clauses (a) and ( f) of the first clause aho, but the additional fact does not concern us. Of these, clause (2), as it stands today, was not originally in the Constitution but was substituted with retrospective effect by Section 3 of the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951. Strictly speaking there never was any clause (2) other than the one we have before us today unless we were to hold that the first Amendment was either not valid or not retrospective .• We were invited to do so and to reconsider the decision in /. C. Cn,lak Nat/a and Others v. State of Punjab and Another1 but we declined because its validity was I.

As a result we are n0t required to read the former clause (2) which never existed. Clauses \\2), (3) and (4) were further amended by the insertion of the words '.'The sovereignty and integrity or India'! in each of them, by Section 2 of the Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act, 1963. The clauses as they exist today read : \"(2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause ( l) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law, in so far as such la-w imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of the sovereignty and in- tegrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. (3) Nothing in sub-clause (b) of the said clause shall affect the opera- tion of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any Jaws imposing, in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause. (4) Nothing in sub-clause (c) of the said clause shall affect the opera- tion of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order or morality, reasonable restrictions on the exer- cise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause. and (5) Notlting in sub-clauses (d), (e) and (f) of the said clause shall affect the o~ration of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub-clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the prf>tecrion of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe.\" •· All that is necessary to be decided by us is whether these dauses save the impugned provisions of the Code as reasonable and valid restrictions upon the guaranteed freedoms. Before we proceed to do so, we may dispose of a very ingenious argument by Mr. A. S. R. Chari which may be summarised thus : \"The o.iginal clause (2) had to bt! read on the commencement of the Constitution and it was as follows : (2) Nothing in sub clause (a) of clause (I) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates, or prevents the State from making any law relating to, libel; slender, defamation, contempt of court or any matter which offends against decency or mora- lity or which undermines the security of, or, tends to overthrow, the State. This clause did not allow restrictions to be placed in the interests of public order on which the impugned provisions are justified today. Admittedly the other parts of clause (2) are not relatable to the impugned provisions and cannot save them without the aid of power exercisable in the interests of public order. Therefore on the coming into force of the Constitution the impugned provisions of the Code became void, that is to say, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

They had to be renacted\". 5. Parties joined ;ssue on whether the provisions were dead, that is to say> were erased from the Statute Book and required re-enactment, or were merely eclipsed, that is to say, remained ineffective till the shadow of the original clause (2) was lifted. We do not propose to enter into this debate. Assuming that the Constitution could be amended with retr:_ospective effect (a point not free altogether from difficulty),the purpose of the amendment is to create a fiction. Whatever may be said of a law declared unconstitutional before the First Amendment, cannot be said of a law which is being considered today after the First Amendment. The fiction in the amendment is to make the Constitu- tion be read with the new clause and no other and a law restricting the freedoms in the interests of public order (among others) or in the interests of the general public must be held to be saved, not as a result of the amendment, but because of these available restrictions operating from the inception of the Constitution. Therefore, although we consider the matter today, after such history has been wri1ten and then unwritten by retrospective amendments of the Constitution (assuming this to be permissible), we read the protection of amended clause (2) as available from January 26, 1950 without a break. The fiction, if given full effect leads to no other conclusion. In this view of the matter we do not find it necessary to refer to the rulings of this Court where the doctrine of eclipse is considered in relation to provisions of laws declared void by Courts in the in- terval. That reasoning ex fade cannot apply to this case. 6. The result, therefore, is that we are only required to discuss whether the provisions of Section 144 and Chapter VIII of the Code can be said to be in the interests of public order in so far as the rights of freedom of speech and expression, rights of assembly and formation of associations and union are concerned and in the interests of the general public in so far as they curtail the freedom of movement throughout the territory of India. 7. In this connection only two topics arise for close study. Firstly what is meant by the express.ions \"in the interest of public order\" occun ing in clause (2) (3) and (4) and \"in the interests of the general public\" occurring in clauses (5). Secondly to what exten~ the provisions of Section 144 and Chapter VIII come within the protection. 8. In so far .1s Section 144 of the Code is concerned this Court in Babula[ Parate v. State of Maharashtra, 2 had held that the section was intra vires the Con- stituti,m but doubts were raised because the judgment of this Court spoke in terms of 'in the interest of maint.-nance of public order' or 'duty of maintena- nce of law and order' when the second clause of Article 19 speaks of -'in the interest of public order'. Differences between the import of these sev~ral expr('ssions were pointed out in several cases from the time the earliest cases of this Court Romuh Thappar v. State of Madras, 3 and Brijbhushan v. State of Delhi' down to Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia v. State of Bihar and Others, 6 and some later cases following that case. The effect of Babula/ Parate' case (supra) was claimed to be lost and it was submitted that the matter needed reconsideration. Although the topic was once again before thh, Court in State of Bihar v. K.K. Misra and Others,' when the second part of sub-section (6) of the section was declared invalid, the decision in Babula/ Parate' s case (supra) 'was not considered in the light of other cases of this Court mentioned above.

The petitioner and the interveners began arguments by invoking the doctrine of preferred-position for the Fundamental Rights particularly the right to freedom of speech and expression . :Mr. Garg, an intervener, squarely based himself on the American doctrine. I\\,fr. Chari for another intervener was indi- rect. His submission is that the Courts, when faced with the question whether any Legic_;lat1ve or executive action is constitutional or not, must range themselves on the side of the Fundamental Freedoms and consider whether the restrictions are reasonable or not. In other wotds, Courts must place the burden on the State to prove the reasonableness of the restriction. A word may, therefore, be said here about how the Court must proceed to examine a challenge to the con- stitutional validity of laws vis-a-vis a fundamental freedom. 10. The preferred-position doctrine in America developed by the Roosevelt Court through Justices Black, Douglas, Murphy, Stone and Rutledge, envisaged that any law restricting freedom of speech, press, religion or assembly must be taken on its face to be invalid till it was proved to be valid. The doctrine was perhaps the result of remark by Justice Stone in Uniled States v. Carolena Products Co. 7 But it has most frequently been used by Justices Black and Dougles in recent years after the deaths of Justices Murphy and Rutledge in 1949. Its history is given by Justice Frankfurter in his concurring opinion in Kovace v. Cooper, 8 in which he rejected it. Justice Rutledge, in Thomas v. Collins/' stated it in these words : \"This case confronts us again with. the duty our system places on this Court to say where the individual's freedom ends and the States' power begins. Choice on that border, now,,as always delicate, is perhaps more so where the usual presumption 3\"tpporting Legislation is balanced by the preferred pl<ice given in our scheme to the great, the indisperisrble free- doms secun·d by the first amendment. That priority gives these liberties a sanctity and a sanction not permitting dubious instructions. For these reasons any attempt to restrict those liberties must be justified by clear public interest, threatened not doubtfully or remotely, but by clear and present danger. The rational connection between the remedy provided and the evil to be curbed, which in other contexts might support legisla- tion against attack on due process ground~, will not suffice. These rights rest on firmer foundation''. The result of the doctrine was to shift the burden of proof on the shoulders of those defending the L~gislation, without raising in their favour the presump· tion of the validity of legislation. It, however, has been abandoned by the majority of judges , alter 1949 when justices Clark and Minton replaced Justices Murphy ;,,nd Rutledge . Justice Frankfurter in the Koz•ace case, (supra) described it as 'a complicated process of constitutional adjudication by adeceptive formula'. It is suffiicient to say that the preferred-position doctrine has not the support of the Supreme Court of the United States and the unreasonable- ness of the law has to be established. 11. In this Court the preferred-position docwrne has never found ground although vague expression such as 'the most cherished right'>', 'the inviolable freedoms' sometimes occur. But this is not to say that any one Fundamental Right is superior to the other or that Article 19 contains a hierarchy. Pre- 7. 11938)304 us 144 . B. ( 1949)136 US 77, 9.

We do not start with the presumption that, being a pre-constitution law, the burden is upon the State to establish its validity. All e:iristing laws are continued till this Court declares them to be in conflict with a fundamental right and, thereforP., void. The burden must be placed on those who contend that a particular law has become void after the coming into force of the Constitution by reason of Art. 13(1), read with any of the guaranteed freedoms. 12. The present doubt has arisen with regard to Babu/al Parate's case (supra), stated earlier, by not adhering to the phraseology of Article 19(2) where the words 'In the interest of public orders' appear. It is these words which need an exposition and not the expression 'in the interest of maintenance of law and order', which are not the words of the article. To expound the meaning of the right expression we are required to go over some earlier decisions of this Court. 13. When Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras and Brijhliushan v. State of Delhi, (supra) were decided, the original clause (2) was there. It did not include phrase 'in the interest of public order'. The validity of statutes was, therefore, tested against the words 'the security of the State'. After the retrospective amendment substituted a new clause, the latter fell to be considered in relation to 'public order'. In Ramjilal Modi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 10 it was pointed out that the language employed by the Constitution, that is to say, 'in the interest of' was wider than the expression 'for the maintenance of' and the former expression made the ambit of the protection very wide. It was observed that •a law may not have been designed to directly maintain public order and yet it may have been enacted in the interest of public order'. This was again reaffir- med in Virendra v. State of Punjah 11 distinguishing on the same ground the two cases before the First Amendment. The following passage (p. 323) may be quoted : \"It will be rememberd that Article 19(2), as it was then word~d, gave protection to a law relating to·any matter which undermined the security of or tended to overthrow the State. Section 9( 1-A) of the Madras Main- tenance of Public Order was made 'for the purpose of securing public safety and the maintenance of public order•. It was pointed out that whatever end the impugned Act might have been intended to subserve and whatever aim its framers might have had in view, its application and scope could not, in the absence of limiting words in the statute itself, be restricted to the aggravated form of activities which were calculated to endanger the security of the State. Nor was there any guarantee that those officers who exercised the power under the Act would, in using them, discriminate between those who acted prejudicially to the security of the state and those who did not. This consideration cannot apply to the case now undP.r consideration. Article 19(2) has been amended so as to extend its protection to a law imposing reasonable restrictions in the interests of public order and the language used in the two sections of the impugned Act quite clearly and explicitly limits the exercise of the powers conferred by them to the purposes specifically mentioned in the sections and to no other purpose\". We may say at once that the distinction has our respectful concurrence. lf. Then came the decision in Superintendent, Central Prison, Fatehgarh v. Ram Manohar Lohia. 12 In that ca!e, the expression 'in the intere~t of public 10. 1957 SCR 860. 12.

(as he then was) traced th exposition of the phrase, panicularly the expression 'public order'. He refnn,d first to the obs~rv,, tions of Patanjali SastriJ, (later C.J.) in Ro~Jh Thappar'J caJe (supra) distinguishing offences involving disturbances of public tranquillity which the learued Jud~e said were in the,)ry off<>nces against public order of a purely local -.i~niticance anti other forms of public disor<le-rs of moro s.-rious and aggra- vatP-d kind calculated to endanger the security of the State. Subbarao, J. also quoted the observations of Fazal Ali, J. in Brij Bhus!zan's caJe (supra) : When we approach the matter in this way, we find that while 'public disorder' is wide enough to cover a small riot or an affray and other cases where peace is disturbed by, or affects, a small group or persons, 'public safety' (or insecurity of the State) will usually b r connected with serious internal disorders and such disturbances of public tranquillity as jeopardi~e the security of the State (p. 612). Subbarao, J. on the strength of those observations concluded that 'public order' was the same as 'public peace and safety' and went on to observe : . \"Presumably in an attempt to get over the effect of those two deci- sions, the expression 'public order' was inserted in Art. 19(2) of the Constitution by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, with a view to bring in offences involving breach of purely local significance within the scope of permissible restrictions under clause (2) of Article 19\". He quoted the observations of the Supreme Court of the United States in Cantw~ll v. Connecticut13 to estahlish that offences against 'public order' were alc;o und erstood as offences against public safety and public peace. He refen-ed to a passa~e in a text-book on the American Constitution which states : \"In the interests of public order, the State may prohibit and punish the causing of 'loud and raucous noise' in streets and pul,lic places by means of sound amplifying imtruments, regulate the hours and place of public discussion, and the use of the public streets for the pm pose of exercising fr eedom of !tp('ech ; provide for the expul.,ion of he l'klers from mPetin'5s and assPrnblies, punish utterances tending to incite an iminPdiate br,-.ach of the peace or riot as distin~uished from ullerances causing mere puhlic inconvenience, annoyance or unrest\". He ref erred also to the Public Order Act, 1936 in England. 15. Subbarao, J. however, distinguished the American and English prece· dents observing : \"But in India under Article I 9(2) this wide concept of 'public order' is split up under different heads. It enables the imposition of reason- able restrictions on the exercise of the right to freedom of speech and expr es.,ion in the inte1ests of the security of the Stah:, frif•ndly relations with foreig;11 States, public order decency or morality, or in relation to contt•mpt of court. defamation or in.-itemtnt to an offence. All the grounds mr:ntio11,'.rl therein can he brought und<'f the general ht'ad 'puhlic order' in its most comprelwnsive sense. But the juxtap05i1ion of the different grounds inchcates that, though som(•t irn <?'s they tend to m·(•rlap, th~v mu-it be ordinarily intended to exclude each other.

His summary of his analysis lf cases may be given in his own words : \" 'Public order' is synonymous with ·public safety a11d tranquillity: it is the ab,ence oi di5order involving breaches of local signifkance in con- tradistinction to national upheavals, such as revolution, civil strife, war, affecting the security of the State.\" 16, We may here observe that the overlap of public order and public tran- quillity is only partial. The terms are not always synonymous. The latter is a much wider expression and takes in many things which cannot be described as public dis- order. The words 'public order' and 'public tranquillity' overlap to a certain extent but there are matters which disturb public tranquillity without being a distur- bance of public order. A person playing loud music in his own house in the middle of the night may disturb public tranquillity, but he is not causing public disorder. 'Public order' no doubt also requires absence of disturbam:P of a state of serenity in society but it goes further. It means, what the Frl!nc h desig- nate ordre publique, ddined as an absence of insurrection, riot turbulence, or crimes of violence. The expression 'public ordn' includes absence of all acts which are a danger to the security of the State and also acts which are com- prehended by the expression 'ordre publique' explained above hut not acts which disturb only the serenity of others. 17. The English and American precedents and legislation are not of such help. The Public Order Act, 1936 was passed because in 1936 different political orsan ;sations marched in uniforms causing I iots. In America the First Amend- ment freedoms have no such qualifications as in India and the rulings arc apt to be mi<:1applied to our Constitution. 18. In the next case of this Court reported in Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia v. Slale of Bihar and OtherJ,a it was pointed out that for expounding the phrase 'maintenance of public order'. \"one has to imagine three concentric circles : Law and order repres- ents the largest circle within which is the next circle representing public order and the smallest circle represents the security of the State\". All cases of disturbances of public tranquillity fell in the largest circle but some of them are Qutside 'public order' for the purpose of the phrase 'maintenance of public ord1rr', similarly every breach of public order is not necessarily a case of an c1ct likely to endanger the security of the State. 19. Adopting this test we may say that the State is at the centre and society surrounds it. Disturbances of society go in a broad spectrum from more disturban ce of the serenity of life to jeopardy of the State. The acts become graver as we j:.urney from the p<iriphery of the largest circle towards the c·entre. In this journey we travel first thwugh public tranquillity, then through public order and lastly to the security of the State. 20. In dealing with the phrase 'maintenance of public order' in the co11lext of preventive detention, we confined the expression in the relevant Art to what was included in the second circte and left out that whkh was in the .largest circle. But that consideration need not always apply because small local distur- bances of the even tempo of life, may in a sense be said to effect 'public 14.

In our judgment the expression 'in the interest of public order' in the Constitution is capable of taking within itself not only those acts which disturb the security of the State or act within ordre publique as described but also certain acts which disturb public tranquillity or are breaches of the peace. It is not necessary to give the expression a narrow meaning because, as has been observed, the expression 'in the interest of public order' is very wide. :W-hatever may be said of 'maintenance of public order' in the context of special laws entailing detention of persons without a trial on the pure subjective determination of the Executive cannot be said in other circumst- ances. In the former case this Court confined the meaning to graver episodes not involving cases of law and order which are not disturbances of public tranquillity but of ordre publique. 21. It was argued that there cannot be two kinds of detention ; one by Magistrate under Code of Criminal Procedure another under laws made for preventive detention under Article 22 of the Constitution. In our opinion the area of the two is entirely different and there is, therefore, good classification. We now proceed to consider the impugned provisions of the Code in the light of what we have said above. 22. We first take up for consideration Section 144 of the Code. It finds place in Chapter XI which contains one section only. It is headed 'Temporary Orders in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger'. The section confers powers to issue an order absolute at once in urgent cases of nuisance or appre• bended danger. Such orders may be made by specified classes of Magistrates when in their opinion there is sufficient ground for proceeding under the section and immediate prevention or speedy remedy is desirable. It requires the Magistrate to issue his order in writing setting forth the material facts of the case and the order is to be served in the manner provided by Section 134 of the Code. The order may direct : (a) any person to abstain from a certain act, or (b) to take certain order with certain p1operty in his possession or under his manageme'nt. The grounds for ~aking the order are that in the opinion of the Magistrate such direction (a) is likely to prevent or (b) tends to prevent, (i) obstruction (ii) annoyance or (iii) injury, to any person la\\\\fully employed or (iv) danger to human life, health or safety or (v) a disturbance of the public tranquality or (vi) a riot or (vii) an affray. Stated briefly the section providf'i for the making of an order which is either (a) prohibitory or (h) mandatory e~ shown above.

J.J (ii) danger to human life, health or safety ; or (iii) a disturbance of the public tranquillity or a riot or an affray. 757 23. The procedure to be followed is next stated. Under sub-section (2) 'if time does not permit or the order cannot be served, it can be made ex parte. Under sub-section (3) the order may be directed to a particular individual or to the public generally when frequenting orvisiting a particular place. Under sub- section (4) the Magistrate may either suo motu or on an application by an aggrieved person, rescind or alter the order whether his own or by a Magistrate subordinate to him or made by his predecessor-in-office. Under sub-section (5) where 'the Magistrate is moved by a person aggrieved he must hear him so that he may show cause against the order and if the Magistrate rejects wholly or in part the application, he must record his reasons in writing. This sub-section is mandatory. An order by the Magistrate does not remain in force after two months from the making thereof but the State Government may, however, extend the period by a notification in the Gazette but, only in cases of danger to human life, health or safety or where there is a likelihood of a riot or an affray. But the second portion of the sub-section was declared violative of Article 19 in Stale of Bihar v. lt.K. Misra {supra). It may be pointed out here that di!obedience of an order lawfully promulgated is made an offence by Sec- tion 188 of the Indian Penal Code, if such disobedience causes obstruction, annoyance or injury to persons lawfully employed. It is punishable with simple imprisonment for one month or fine of Rs. 200/ or both . . 2•. The gist of action under Section 144 is the urgency of the situation, its efficacy in the likelihood of being able to prevent some harmful occurrences. As it is possible to act; absolutely and even ex parte it is obvious tl1at t! • .:: e,mergency must be sudden and the consequences sufficiently grave. Without it the exercise of power would have no i_ustification. It is not an ordinary power ftowing from administration but a power used in a judicial manner and which can st'lnd further judicial scrutiny in the need for the exercise of the power, in its efficacy and in the extent of its application. There is no general proposition that an order under Section 144, Criminal Procedure Code cannot be passed without taking evidence : see Mst. 'jagrupa Kumari v. Chohey Narain Singh11 which in our opinion is correct in laying down this proposition. These fundamental facts emerge from the way the occasions for the exercise of the power are mentioned. Di!turbances of public tranquillity, riots and affray · lead to subversion of public order unless they are prevented in time. Nuisances dangerous to human life, health or safety have no doubt to be abated and prevented . We are, however, not concerned with this part of the section and the validity of this part need not be decided here. In so far as the other parts of the section are concerned the key-note of the power is to free society from menace of serious disturbances of a grave cha_racter. The section is directed against those who attempt to prevent the exercise of -legal rights by others or imperil the public safety and health. If that be so the matter must fall within the restrictions which the Constitution itself visualizes as permissible in the in- terest of public order, or in the interest of the general public. We may say, however, that annoyance must assume sufficiently grave proportions to bring the matter within interests of public order. 25. The criticism, however, is that the section suffers from over broadness and the words of the section are wide enough to give an absolute power which 15. 37 Cr L J. 95. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Revision against his determination to the High Court may prove illusory because before the High Court can intervene the mischief will be done. Therefore, it is submitted that an inquiry shoutd precede the making of the order. In other words, the burden should not be placed upon the person affected to clear his position. Further the order may be so gener.il as to affect not only a particular party but persons who arc innocent, as for example when there is an order banning meetings, processions, playing of music etc. 26. The effect of the order being in the interest of public order and the interests of the general public, occasions may arise when it is not possible to distinguish between those whose conduct must be controlli>d and those whose conduct is clear. As was pointed out in Babulal Parate's ea~ (supra) where two rival trade unions clash_!?d and it was difficult to say whether a person belonged to one of the unions or to the general public, an order restricting the activities of the genera! public in the particular area was justified. 27. It may be pointed out that mere disobedience of the order is not enough to constitute an offence. There must be in addition obstruction, annoyance, or danger to human life, health or safety or a riot or an affray before the offence under Section 188, Indian Penal Code is constituted. Thus the person affected has several remedies. He can ask the 01·der to be vacated as against him, he can file a t'evision and even a petition for a writ. But no person can ask to be considered free to do what he likes when there are grounds for thinking that his conduct would be of the kind described in the section for purp()ses of preventive action. Ordinarily the order would be directed against a person found acting or likely to act in a particular way. A general order may be necessary when the number of persons is so large that distinction between them and the general public cannot be made without the risks mefi:- tioned in the section. A general order is thus justified but if the action is too general, the order m<\\y be questioned by appropriate remedies for which there is ample provision in the law. 28. All those matters were considered also by this Court in Babula/ Parate'scase (supra). In that case the Court emphasised that the ri>straint is tem- porary, the puwer is exercistd by S<'nior Magistrates who have to set down the material facts, in other words, to make an inquiry in the exercise of judicial power with reasons for the order, with an opportunity to an aggrit:ved person to have it rescinded either by the Magistrate or the superior Courts. \\Ve have reconsidered all those matters and are satisfied that there are sufficient safe- guards available to person affected by the order and the restrictions therefore are reasonable. \\Ve are -of opinion that Section 144 is not unconstitutional if properly applied and the fact that it may be abused is no ground for striking it down. The remedy then is to question the exercise of power as being outside the grant of the law. 29. We next proceed to consider the constitutional validity of Chapter VIII of the Code. It finds place in Part IV which has the explanatory head- ing 'Prevention of Offences'. The Chapter is divided into th1·ee divisions A, B and C. The purport of the Chapter can be gathered from its sub-heading 'Of Security for keeping the Peace and for good behaviour'. 30. Division A is for security for keeping the peace on conviction. It consists of on[y ont> section (Section I 06) and it provides that on conviction for certain offences, the Court may, at the time of passing sentence on the person convict~'d, if of opinion, that it is necessary to take a bond for future good ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

J.) 759 behaviour, order him to execute a bond,with or without sureties, for keep- ing the peace for a period not exceeding thcee years. The sum for which the bond is taken is proportionate to the means of the person and it becomes void if the conviction ultimately fails. The section is aimed at persons whose past conduct has proved dangerous to the public and is intended to secure public tranquillity and peace. 31. Divbion B then consists of 12 sections (Sections 107-110 and 112-119) and appli1..·s to case-i other than those mentioned in SectiQf'l 106. Of these, Section 107 is for taking security generally for keP.ping the peace; Section 108 is for security for good behaviour from persons disseminating sedition ; Sec- tion 109 for security fur good behaviour from vagrants an9, suspected persons and Section I JO for security for good behaviour from habitual offenders. Sections 112-119 lay down the procedure to be followed in these cases. We are concerned in these cases with the provisions of Section 107 and therefore need not reter to Sections 108-110. 32. The gist of Section 107 may now be given. It enables certain specified classes of Magistratc•s to make an order calling upon a person to show cause why he should not be ord ered to execute a bond, with or without sureties for kecpin~ the peace for such period not exceeding one year as the Magistrate thinks fit to fix. The condition of taking action is that the Magis- trate is infol'med and he is of opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceed- ing that a person is likP,(y to commit a breach of the peace or disturb the public tranquillity or 10 Jo .my wrongful act that may probably occasion a b1each of the peace or disturb the public tranquillity. The Magistrate can proi::eed if the prrson is within °his jurisdktion or the place of the apprehend ed breach of the peace or disturbotnce is within the local limits of his jurisdiction. The section goes on to empower even \" Magistrate not empowered to take action, to record his reason for actiug, and then to order the arrest of the person (if not already in cuc;tody or br:.f ore lhe court) with a view to sending him before a :\\fagistrate empowered to d~al with the case, togcth~r with a copy of his reasons. The Magistrate before whom such a person is sent may in his discrt~thm detain such person in cuslody pending further action by him. 33. The section i:; aimed at persons who cause a reasonable apprehension of conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace or disturbance of the public tranquillity. This is an instance of p,eventive justice_ which the courts are intended to administer. This provision like the preceding one is in aid of orderly society an<l seeks to nip in the bud conduct subversive of the peace and public tranquillity. .For this purpose Ma~istrntes are invested with large jud- icial di-,crNionary powers for the preservation of public peace and order. The- refore the justification for such provisions is claimed by the State to be in the function or the State which emhraccs not only the punishment of offenders but, as far as pmsible, the prevention of offences. 34:. Both the sections are counter-parts of the same policy, the first applying wlren by reason of the conviction of a person, his past conduct leads to an app1chensio11 for the futurt, and the second applying where the Magistrate, on ml~irmatiun, is of the opinion that unles!I prevented from so acting, a person is likely to act to the detriment of the public peace and public tranquillity. The argument is that these sections (more particularly Section l07) are destructive of freedom of the individual guaranteed by Article 19 (I) (a),(b), (c) and (d) and are not saved by the restrictions contemplated hy clau<Jes (2) to (5) of the Article.

We have seen the provisions of Section 107. That section says that action is to be taken 'in the manner hereinafter provided' and this clearly indicates that it is not open to a Magistrate in stlfh a case to depart from the procedure to any substantial extent. This is very salutary because the liberty of the person is involved and the law is rightly solicitous, that this liberty should only be curtailed according to its own procedure and not according to the whim of the Magistrate concerned. It behoves us, therefore, to emphasise the safeguards built into the procedure because from there wiU arise the con- sideration of the reasonableness of the 1·estrictions in the interest of public order or in the interest of the general public. 36. The procedure begins with Section 112. It requires that the Mag- istrate acting under Section 107 shall make an order in writing, setting forth the substance of the information received, the amount of the bond, the term for which it is to be in force and the number, character and cla!ls of sureties (if any) required. Since the person to be proceeded against has to show cause, it is but natural that he must know the grounds for apprP.hending a breach of the peace or disturbance of the public tranquillity at his hands. Although the section speaks of the 'substance of the information' it does not mean that the order should not be full.· lt may not repeat the information bodily but it must give prop~r notice of what-lia.s moved the Magistrate to take the action. This order is the foundation of the jurisdiction and the word 'substance' means the essern;e of the most important puts of the information. 37. Next follow three sections-Sections 113-115. They deal with the person's- presence. Section 113 deals with the situation when the person is 'Jresent in court, then the order shall be read over to him and if he so de!lires, the substance of it shall be explained to him. This is not a mere formality. The intention is to explain to the penon what the allegations against him are. The next section (Section 114) deals with a situation when the person is not present in court. There the option is two-fold. Ordinarily, a summons must issue to him but in cases where the immediate arrest of the person is necessary .l warrant for his arrest may issue. This is however subject to the qualifica- tion that there must be a report of a Police Officer or other information in that behalf and the breach of the peace cannot otherwise be prevented. The Magistrate must not act on an oral information but must record the substance of it before issuing a wan·ant. The section also envisages a situation in which the person is already in custody. In that case the Magistrate shall issue a wan-ant directing the Officer having the custody to produce that person. The provisions of this section are quite clearly reasonable in the three circumstances it deal~ with. If the presence of the person is to be secnred, a summons to him is the normal course except in the other two cases. 38. Section 115 then provides that such summons or warrant under Section 114, as the case may be, must be accompanied by the order under Section 112 and the person serving or executing the summons or warrant must serve the order on the person. There is enabling power in Section 116 under which the Magistrate may dispense with the presence of the person in Court and allow him to appear by a pleader. 39. Then follows Section 117.

Inquiry as to truth of information- ( l} When an order under Section 112 has been read or explained under Section 113 to a person present in Court, or when any person appears or is brought before a Magistrate in compliance with, or in execution of, a summons or warrant issued under Section I 14, the Magistrate shall proceed to inquire into the truth of the information upon which action has been taken, and to take such evidence as may appear necessary . (2} Such inquiry shall be made, as nearly as may be practicable, in the manner hereinafter prescribed for conducting trials and recording evidence in summons cases. (3) Pending the completion of the inquiry under sub-section (I), the Magistrate, if he considers that immediate measures are necessary for the prevention of a breach of the peace or disturbance of the public tranquillity or the commission of any offence or for the public safety, may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, direct the person in respect of whom the order under Section 112 has been made to execute a bond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace or maintaining good behaviour until the conclusion of the inquiry, and may detain him in custody until such bond is executed or, in default of execution, until the enquiry is concluded.\" -ie>. The first sub-section, read with the second requires the Magistrate to inquire into the truth of the information. The third sub-section enables the Magistrate to ask an interim bond pending the completion of the inquiry by him. This is conditioned by the fact that immediate measures are necessary for the prevention of a breach of the peace or disturbance of the public tran- quillity or the commission of any offence or for prevention of public safety. This is applicable where the person is not in custody and his being at large wthout a bond may endanger public safety, etc. The Magistrate has to justify his action by reasons to be recorded in writing. If the person fails to execute a bond, with or without sureties, the Magistrate is empowered to detain him in custody. fl. A question was raised before us whether the Magistrate can defer the inquiry and yet ask for an interim bond. There is a difference of opinion in the High Courts. Some learned Judges are of opinion that this action can be taken as soon as the person appears because then the Magistrate may be said to have entered upon the inquiry. Other learned Judges are of the opinion that sub-sections (l} and (2) envisage that the Magistrate must proceed to inquire into the truth of the information and only after prima facie satisfying himself about the truth and after recording his reasons in writing can the in- terim bond be asked for. Some of the cases on the previous view are-Emperor v. Nabibux and Others, 16 Dulal Chandra Mondal v. State, 17 Gani Ganai and Others v. State18 and Laxmilal v.

In our opinion the words of the section are quite clear. As said by Straight J. in Emperor v. Babua, 28 the order under Section 112 is on hearsay but the inquiry under Secti\"'On J J 7 is to ascertain the truth of the necessary informa- tion. Sub-section ( l) contemplates an immediate ~nquiry into the truth of the information. It is pending the completion of the inquiry that an interim bond can be asked for if immediate measures are necessary, and in default it is ne~essary to put the person in custody. Therefore, as the Jibert¥ of a person is involved, and that person is being proceeded against on information and suspicion, it is necessary to put a strict construction upon the powers of Magis- trate. The facts must be of definite character. In Nafar Chandra Pal v. The King Emperor29 there was only a petition and a report and these were not found sufficient material. In some of the cases before us no effort was made by the Magistrate to inquire :uto the truth of the allegations. The Magistrate adjou- rned the case from dc1y to day and yet asked for an interim bond. This makes the proceedings entirely one-sided. It cannot be described as an inquiry with- in an inquiry as has been said in some cases. Some inquiry has to be made before the bond can be ordered. We, therefore, approve of those cases in which it has been laid down that some inquiry should be made before action is taken to ask for an interim bond or placing the person in custody in default. In an old case reported in A.D. Dunne v. Hemchandra, 30 a Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court went into the matter. The case arose before the present Code of Criminal Procedure and, therefore, there was no provision for an interim bond. But what Sir Barnes Peacock, C.J. said applies to the changed law also not o_nly with regard to the ultimate order but also to the interim order for a bond. The section even as it is drafted today is hedged in with proper safeguards and it would be moving too far away from the guarantee of freedom, if the view were allowed to prevail that without any inquiry into 1he truth of the informa- tion sufficient to make out a prima facie case a person is to be put in jeopardy of detention. A definite finding is required that immediate steps are necessary. The order must be one which can be made into a final order unless something to the contrary is esdtblished. Therefore it is not open to a Magistrate to adjourn the case and in the interval to send a person to jail if he fails to furnish a bond. If this were the law a bond could always be insisted upon before even the inquiry began and that is neither the sense of the law nor th<! wording or arrangement of the sections already noticed. 43. The power which is conferred under this Chapter is distinguished from the power of detention hy exP.cutive action under Article 22 of the Cons- titution. Although the order to execute a bond, issued before an offence is committed, hds the appearance of an administrative order, in reality it is judicial in character. Primarily the provision en<1bles the .:VIagistrate to re- quire the execution of a bond and not to detain the person. Detention results only on default of execution of such bond. It is, therefore, not apposite to characterise the provision as a law for detention contemplated by Article 22. The safeguards are thert-fore different. The person sought to he bound over has rights which the trial of <,nmmom ca~e confers on an a<'cused. The order is also capable of being questioned in superior courts. For this reason, at every ~tep th e law 1equires the Magistrdtti to state his rea,ons in writing. It would make hi~ action pur(•!y admini~trative if he were to pas-. the order for an in- 25.

Neither the scheme of the chapter nor the scheme of Section 117 can bear such an interpretation. We accordingly, hold in the case of l\\iadhu Limaye (Writ Petition 307 of 1970-Madhu Limaye and Anoiher v. Ved Afurti and Others) that as the case was simply adjourned from tim~ to time and there was no inquiry before remanding him to custody his detention was illegal. We may now briefly notice the remaining sections of the Chapter .ff. Section 118 then lays down that if upon inquiry it is proved that the person be called upon to execute a bond for keeping the peace or maintaining good behaviour the :\\1agistrate may call upon him to execute a bond. The security must not be more than that stated in the order under Section 112, nor excessive. Under Section 119 the lVIagistrate may discharge the person or release him from custody if the necessity for keeping him bound over is not proved. 45. The last Division numbered C relates to proceedings subsequent to Section 118. Section 120 fixes the terminus a quo for the period for which security is required. Section 121 gives the contents of the bond and the con- ditions under which there is a breach of the bond. Section 122 empowers the Magistrate to reject sureties but only after inquiry and recording the evidence and his rea~ons for rejection. Section 123 gives power to commit a person to prison or to be detained in prison if already there for the duration mentioned in the bond. If the period is more than a year then the proceedings have to be submitted to a superior court. It also provides for ancillary matters. Sec- tion 124 empowers the District Magistrate or a Chief Presidency Magistrate to release a person so detained when there is no longer any hazard to the com- munity or to any other person. There are other provisions for reducing secu- rity etc. with which we are not concerned. Section 125 enables the same Magistrates to cancel any bond for sufficient reason and under Section 126 the sureties also stand discharged. Section 126-A deals with security for the unex- pired period of bond to which 110 special reference is needed. 46. The gist of the Chapter is the prevention of crimes and disturbance of public tranquillity and breaches of the peace. There is no need to prove ovt'rt acts although if overt acts have taken place they will have to be conside- red. The action being preventive is not based on overt act but on the poten- tial dange1· to be averted. These provisions are thus essentially conceived in the interest of public order in the sense defined by us. They are also in the interest of the general public. If prevention of crimes, and brea..:hes of peace and disturbance of public tranquillity are directed to the maintenance of the even tempo of community life, there can be no doubt that they are in the in- terest of public order. As we have shown above 'public order' is an elastic expression which takes within its various meanings according to the context of the law and the existence of special circumstances. This power was used in England for over 400 years and is not something which is needed only for ad- ministration of colonial empires. Its need in our society today is as great as it was before the British left. We find nothing contrary to Article 19(1) (a), (b), (c) and (d) because the limits of the restrictions are well within clauses (2), l3), (4) and (5). We accordingly hold the Chapter as explained br us to be con- stitutionally valid . -t7.

Apart from the fact (which we have sufficiently emphasised above} that Section 107 itself speaks that the procedure of Chapter VIII should be followed, Section 55 deals with special cases of arrest and cannot be made applicable where Sections 112, l 13 and 114 of the Code prescribe their own procedures. Similarly, Section 91 may be available tiJl the order under Section 112 is drawn up. After it is drawn up the Magistrate has to act under Sections 1J3 and 117(1). Then there is no room for Section 91. The reasoning in some of the cases of . which Vasudeo Ojha and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh81 is an example, is falla- cious. 48. There is also no question of bail to the person because if instead of an interim bond, bail for appearance was admissible Chapter VIII would un- doubtedly have said so. Further bail is only for the continued appearance of a person and nat to prevent him from committing certain acts. To release a person being proceeded against under Sections 107/112 of the Code is to frus- trate the very purpose of the proceedings unless his good behaviour is ensured by taking a bond in that behalf. 49. We have said in our earlier order that we hold the provisions of Sec- tion 144 and Chapter VIII, as interpreted by us, to be valid. We have shown above how these provisions have to be understood and applied. So read, we are of opinion that they do not offend the provisions of Article 19 (l} (a), (b), (c) and (d). The J udgment of the Court was delivered by BHAROAVA, J.-I agree with the judgment of my Lord, the Chief Justice, with the exception that I am unable to subscribe to the view that, in proceed- ings started under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Magis- trate can direct the person, in respect of whom an order under Section 112 has been made, to execute a bond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace pending completion of the enquiry and, in default, detain him in custody until such bond is executed, only after he has entered upon the enquiry under Sec- tion 117(1} and has found a prima fade case satisfying himself about the truth of the information on the basis of which the proceedings were started. This interpretation, in my opinion, will completely defeat the purpose of Section 117(3). 51. It has to be noticed that, when proceedings are contemplated under Section 107, the Magistrate takes action when he is informed that any person is likely to commit a breach of the peace or disturb the public tranquillity, only after forming an opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against him. The Magistrate cannot start the proceedings merely because of the in- formation received by him. Pursuant to the information, the Magistrate has to form his opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding. This opinion can be formed on the basis of the information supplied to him if he finds that the information i'S given in sufficient detail and is reliable enough to justify his acting on its basis. In cases where the information given is not of such nature, it will be the duty of the Magistrate to hold further inquiry and satisfy himself that it is a fit case where action should be taken because sufficient grounds exist. There may be cases where the information may be received from the police in which case the Magistrate may examine all the police papers and satisfy himself that there do exist sufficient grounds for him to take the the proceedings as requested by the police.

(Hidayatullah, c. 7.) 765 proceedings may be instituted at the instance of a private complainant who may be apprehending breach of the peace by the person complained against. In such cases, the Magistrate is bomad either to hold some inquiry himself by exa- mining witnesses on oath or to have an inquiry made through the police, so that he may be able to forrn a correct opinion as to the existence of sufficient grounds for proceediug. It is after the Magistrate has taken these steps that he can proceed to make the order under Section 112. When making that order, he has to record in it in writing the substance of the information received which necessarily meam the part of the information which was the basis of his opinion that sufficient grounds exist for initiating the proceedings. It is at this preliminary stage that the Magistrate is thus required to ensure that a prima facie case does exist for the purpose of initiating proceedings against the person who is to be called upon to furnish security for keeping the peace. 52. After the order under Section 112 has been issued, the procedure to be adopted is that contained in Sections 113 and 114. If such person is present in Court, the order under Section 112 has to be read over to him ar.d, if he so desires, the substance thereof has to be explained to him. If he is not present in Court, the Magistrate has to issue a summons requiring him to appear, or, when such person is in custody, a warrant, directing the officer in whose cus- tody he is, to bring him before the Court. Another alternative procedure is laid down for cases where it appears to· the Magistrate that there is reason to fear the commission of a breach of the peace, and that such breach of the peace cannot be prevented otherwise than by the immediate arrest of such person ; in such cases, the l\\1agistrate can issue a warrant for the arrest of that person. It is under this procedure that the person appears or is brought before the Court. The proceedings to be taken thereafter are laid down in Section 117 (I) which requires that, as soon as the order under Section l l2 has been read or explained to the pe1 son present in Court under Section 113, or to the person who appears or is brought before a Magistrate under Section I 14, the Magistrate has to pro· ceed to enquire into the truth of the information upon which action has been taken, and to take such further evidence as may appear necessary. This inquiry under sub-section (2) of Section 117 has to be held in the manner prescribed for conducting trials and recording evidence in summons cases. Sub-section ( l) of Section 117, thus, contain,;; a mandatory direction on the Magistrate to start proceedings of inquiry aq soon as the person, in respect of whom the order under :,ection 112 has been made, appears before the Magistrate. 53. Section 117 (I) makes it clear that the Magistrate must institute the inquiry without any unnecessary delay. This provision cannot, however, be interpreted as requiring that the inquiry must begin immediately when the person appears in the Court. Obviously, such a requirement would be im- practicable. In a case where a summons is issued to the person to appear in Court, or a warrd\\lt is issued undel' the proviso to Section l l--1- for his arrest, the date and time when the person will appear in the Court of the Magistrate will always remain uncertain. Some time will have to be.taken in serving the summons and, depending on the distance ,md accessibility of the place where the person happens to be, the time taken in serving the summons wiU vary. Even in ca~es where a warr.int is issued under the pr0viso to Section 114, the person may not be produ..:ed in Court immediately because of the place of his arrest which may be miles away from the Court of the l\\1agistrate. The Legis- lature could not have contemplated that, in such contingencies, witnt>sses must be kept ready in the Court of the Magi .. trate awaiting the appearance of the person concerned, so thdt the ~1agistrate cdn start the inquiry immediately .

The result of the inquiry can be that the penon concerned can be asked to execute bonds and give sureties for ke<>p- ing the peace and, if he commits default in doing so, he can be detained in prison losing his personal liberty. In such cases, the person concerned has a right to be represented by a lawyer in the inquiry. C,msequently, when he appears before the Magistrate, he can legitimately ask for a responsible adjourn- ment to enable him to engage a lawyer of his choice and, thus, at his own re• quest, he can ensure that the inquiry does not begin immediately. The pro- per interpretation of sub-section ( 1) of Section 117, in my opinion, is that the inquiry must be begun as soon as practicable and a Magistrate would be com- mitting a breach of the dilection contained in this sub-section if he postpones the inquiry without sufficient reasons. !H. It is in the light of these principles that, in my opinion, the powe1· gJ'anted to the .Magistrate under Section 117(3) should be interpreted. That power is given for cases wh~e immediate measures are necessary for the pre- vention of a breach of the peace. In such a situation, the Magistrate can direct the pi!rson, in respect of whom the order under Section 112 has been made, to execute a uond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace pend- ing completion of the inquiry under Section 117(1) and, if he fails to execute the bond, the ~Iagistrate can direct his detention until the inquiry is concluded. 55. This power to be exercised by the Magistrate in emergent cases has been conferred in the background of the procedure which he has to adopt under Section 187 of forming an opinion, after receipt of information, that there do exist sufficient grounds for taking proceedings. At the first stage, when forming such opinion, the -Ylagistrate naturally acts ex parte and has to rely on information supplied to him or other information obtained by him in the abllence of the person against wh~m proceedings are to be taken. 56. It is on the basis of that opinion that the _yfagi.,tr.ate proceeds to make the order under Section 112 and is emp'>wered even to issue a wdrrant of arrest under the proviso to Section 114. T-he power under Section 117(3) is most likely to be invoked in cases where the Magistrate has, at an earlier sta~e, issued the warrant under the proviso to Section 114. This is sr> because the warrant is issued in cases where breach of the peact:' cannot be prevented other- wise than by immediate arrest, and Section 117(3) also is to be invoked where the Magistrate considers that immediate measures are necessary for prevention of breach of the peace. The Legislature, having P-mpowered the Magistrate to issue warrant of arrest, naturally proceeded fur~her to give p,1wer to the Magistrate in such cases to direct that br>nds -for keeping the peace be furnished pendin1; completion of the inquiry. The expression \"c;:011,pletion of the inquiry\" must be interpreted as the period covered from th,~ beginning of the inquiry until its conclusion. 57. The bond$ can, therefore, cover the period from the moment the inquiry is to begin. Such a power for requiring that bond-; br: furnished pen- ding inquiry. is obviously necessary where there is immediate danger of breach of the peace. and . immediate measures are necessary for its prevention. The order is mad~ on the basis of the earlier opinion formed by the \\-fagistrate under Section 107. Subsequently, of course, when the inquiry is held under Section 117 ( 1), the correctness of the informatiou and the tentative opin:on formed ex parte under Section I 07 will bP proper I y tested after going through the judicial procedure prescribed for the trial of summon~ ca-;es and, th~reupon, if it is found that therf:! was no justification, the order would be revoked.

J.) 767 opinion, the grant of such a power to a Magistrate is a very reasonable restric- tion on the personal liberty of a citizen. 1t is needed for prevention of crimes and it can only be eff~ctive if its exercise is permitted on the basis of opinion formed by a competent authority that immediate measures are required. It is true that, under Section 117(3), a person can be detained in jail even prior to a Court arriving at a judicial finding agaimt him ; but such a procedure is not only reasonable, but essential. 58. In this respect, the power of a Magisftate in regard to a person ac- cused of a cognizable offence is comparable. If a :\\,1agistrate has sufficiently reliable information to form an opinion that a person has committed a cogniz- able offence, the Magistrate can order his detention as an under-trial prisoner. :At that stage, the law deems that person still to be innocent and, yet, his deten- tion in prison is considered reasonable in order to ensure that a proper trial can be held and there is no repetition of the offence of which that person is accused. This detention as an under-trial prisoner is also based on the ex parte opinion formed by the ~lagistrate before the actual trial. The power granted under Section 117(3) is very similar and is intended to ensure that the person, from whom breach of the peace is apprehended, is not at liberty to commit breach of the peace and thus defeat the purpose of the proceedings by being allowed to re:nain at liberty without any undertaking during the pendency of the inquiry. 59. In this connection, it was urged by Mr. Garg that, if Section 117(3) is interpreted as pt>rmitting a Magistrate to direct furnishing of bonds for keep- ing the peace and to orde1· detention in default without any evidence being obtained in the course of the inquiry, the Magistr~te may keep on adjourning the hearing of the inquiry under Section 117(1) and, thus, keep the person in detention for long periods without giving him the opportunity of showing that there is no justification for orders being made against him. In my opinion, the validity of a provision of this nature is not to be judged from the likelihood of the abuse of the power by the ::\\lagistrate. If the Magistrate, after making orders under Section 117(3), unnecessarily postpones the inquiry, he would, in my opiuiou, be only abusing his powers, but will be acting contrary to the mandate of the law contained in Section 117( I) itself which, as I have indicated above, requires that the Magistrate \"llUst proceed to enquire into the truth of the infor- mation without unnecessary delay. In cases where the power is abused and the hearing is unnecessarily delayed, the proceedings would be liable to be quashed and the person se1 at liberty on the ground that the :\\fagistrate has not com- plied with the requirements of Section 117(1). On the other h ,nd, if the Magistrate docs comply with Section 117{ I) by continuing the proceedings of inquiry expeditiously and without any delay, I do not think it can be said tha1 tile detention of the pl•rson, a~inst whom the proceedings are being taken, is not a reasonable restriction on his personal libe1·ties when the l\\l~istratt! has already found that immediate measures are necessary for prevention of breach of the peace and the person concerned has def,111lted in furnishing bonds to keep the peace d 11ring the pend1mcy 01' the inquiry . 60. These are the reasons why, in my opinion, the powers under Section 117(3) can be exercised without the Magist .. ate recording evidence and finding a prima facie case after starting the inquiry under Section 117 (I). Even on this interpretation, Section 117(3) is valid and is a reasonable restriction under Article 19(2), (3), (4) and (5) of the Constitution.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
