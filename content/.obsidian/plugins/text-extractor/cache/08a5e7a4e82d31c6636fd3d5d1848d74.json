While there are real and valid concerns in the non-uniform application of the Bachan Singh framework, discretion in sentencing, in itself - is not worrisome, and the concern needs to be dispelled. While generally Judges may look to precedents for the comfort of numbers, that process only gives an indication of how similar instances have been dealt with and has a limited role when it comes to sentencing. The discretion afforded to the court in sentencing, is not for it to be Judge-centric or result in disparate rulings, but in fact to enable the court with the flexibility of considering the case-specific factors relating to the crime and criminal, without falling into predetermined patterns . Sentencing is not a mathematical equation and ought not be seen as one. This has been recognised in numerous cases starting from B achan Singh case itself. Rather than applying strict classification of the type of offences that warrant death sentence, the court must focus on equally considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstance s (in which commonality is to be drawn across case), and arrive at individualised sentencing outcomes on a case-to-case basis. (Paras 228 and 229) In Macchi Singh, (1983) 3 SCC 470, the Supreme Court also attempted to categorise cases under broadly five heads (i.e. manner of commission of murder, motive, anti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime, magnitude of crime, and personality of victim), by strongly analysing the aggravating circumstances of the crime. A formalistic reliance on these categories however, has the potential of leading any court awry as it has the unintended effect of drawing attention away from the criminal, and focussing disproportionately on the crime. (Para 221) The Supreme Court in Bachan Singh, (1980) 2 SCC 684, had warned against categorising cases. Rejecting the contention that standards and guidelines should be laid down, it was noted in Ba chan Singh case that degree of culpability cannot be measured, and aggravating and mitigating circumstances could not be a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MANOJ v. STATE OF M.P. 355 rigidly enumerated so as to exclude \"all free play of discretion\". Reiterating that criminal cases cannot be categorised as there were infinite, unpredictable and unforeseen variations, it was held in Bachan Singh case that by such categorisation, the sentencing process would cease to be judicial, and such standardisation or sentencing discretion is beyond the court's function. Therefore, it would be befitting if reliance were placed not solely on those five categories of crimes (which lays undue emphasis on aggravating circumstances) enumerated in Machhi Singh, and instead on the two-question test, and the four guiding principles of Bachan Singh that were succinctly culled out in Machhi Singh. (Para 222) The strength of \"precedent\" and \"consistency\" is perhaps, therefore, lowest when it comes to matters of sentencing, as long as it is within the confines oflegality and resulting in \"principled sentencing\". In other words, the judicial incongruence when it relates to sentencing, would in fact be a positive indicator, rather than a negative one, provided it is still within the well-defined contours of \"principled\" sentencing. (Para 230) For sentencing in capital offences, discretion to arrive at individualised sentences is encouraged, but must be constrained by the \"rarest of rare\" principle, wherein the court considers aggravating circumstances of the crime, and mitigating circumstances of the criminal (a \"liberal and expansive\" construction of the latter), which in turn must inform their consideration of whether the option of life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed owing to an impossibility to reform. Deviation from this principle i.e. unguided discretion on the other hand, would quite obviously lead to bad law. Therefore, \"individualised, principled sentencing\" - based on both the crime and criminal, with consideration of whether reform or rehabilitation is achievable (held to be \"probable\" in Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik, (2019) 12 SCC 460), and consequently whether the option of life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed - should be the only factor of \"commonality\" that must be discernible from decisions relating to capital offences. With the creation of a new sentencing threshold in Swamy Shraddananda (2) case, and later affirmed by a Constitution Bench in V. Sriharan, oflife imprisonment without statutory remission (i.e. Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution are still applicable), yet another option exists, before imposition of death sentence.

(2) The age of the accused. If the accused is young or old, he shall not be sentenced to death. (3) The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society.

This information would include aspects relating to the nature, motive and impact of crime, culpability of convict, etc. Quality of evidence adduced is also a relevant factor. For instance, extent of reliance on circumstantial evidence or child witness plays an important role in the sentencing analysis. But what is sorely lacking, in most capital sentencing cases, is information relating to characteristics and socio-economic background of the offender. The State's duty is heightened in importance even more so, in the Indian context where a majority of the accused have a poor or rudimentary level of legal representation. (Paras 241 to 24 7) There is urgent need to ensure that mitigating circumstances are considered at the trial stage, to avoid slipping into a retributive respons e to the brutality of the crime, as is noticeably the situation in a majority of cases reaching the appellate stage. (Para 248) To do this, the trial court must elicit information from the accused and the State, both. The State, must-for an offence carrying capital punishment-at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused. This will help establish proximity (in terms of time line), to the accused person's frame of mind (or mental illness, if any) at the time of committing the crime and offer guidance on mitigating factors (1), (5), (6) and (7) spelled out in Bachan Singh, (1980) 2 SCC 684. Even for the other factors of (3) and (4) in the Bachan Singh list-an onus placed squarely on the State-conducting this form of psychiatric and psychological evaluation close on the heels of commission of the offence, will provide a baseline for the appellate courts to use for comparison i.e. to evaluate the progress of the accused towards reformation, achieved during the incarceration period. (Para 249) Next, the State, must in a time-bound manner, collect additional information pertaining to the accused. An illustrative, but not exhaustive list is as follows: (a) Age (b) Early family background (siblings, protection of parents, any history of violence or neglect) (c) Present family background (surviving family members, whether married, has children, etc.) (d) Type and level of education (e) Socio-economic background (including conditions of poverty or deprivation, if any) (f) Criminal antecedents (details of offence and whether convicted, sentence served, if any) (g) Income and the kind of employment (whether none, or temporary or permanent, etc.); (h) Other factors such as history of unstable social behaviour, or mental or psychological ailment(s), alienation of the individual (with reasons, if any), etc. (Para 250) This information should mandatorily be available to the trial court, at the sentencing stage. The accused too, should be given the same opportunity to produce evidence in rebuttal, towards establishing all mitigating circumstances.

If the appeal is heard after a long hiatus from the trial court's conviction, or the High Court's confirmation, as the case may be - a fresh report (rather than the one used by the previous court) from the jail authorities is recommended, for a more exact and complete understanding of the contemporaneous progress made by the accused, in the time elapsed. The jail authorities must also include a fresh psychiatric and psychological report which will further evidence the reformative progress, and reveal post-conviction mental illness, if any. (Para 251) Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684: 1980 SCC (Cri) 580,followed Anil v. State of Maharashtra, (2014) 4 SCC 69 : (2014) 2 SCC (Cri) 266, affirmed E. Penal Code, 1860 - S. 302 - Imposition of death sentence Recording of special reasons therefor, held, mandatory - Special reasons must be such as to compel the court to hold that it is impossible to reform and rehabilitate the offender after examining the matter with due regard to the age, character and antecedents of the offender and the circumstances in which the offence was committed - Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, Ss. 354(3), 235(2), 360 and 361 Held: Death sentence is ordinarily ruled out and can only be imposed for \"special reasons\", as provided in Section 354(3). There is another provision in the 1973 Code which also uses the significant expression \"special reason\". It is Section 361. Section 360 of the 1973 Code re-enacts, in substance, Section 562 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (\"the old Code\"). Section 361 which is a new provision in the 1973 Code makes it mandatory for the court to record \"special reasons\" for not applying the provisions of Section 360. Section 361 thus casts a duty upon the court to apply the provisions of Section 360 wherever it is possible to do so and to state \"special reasons\" if it does not do so. In the context of Section 360, the \"special reasons\" contemplated by Section 361 of the 197 3 Code must be such as to compel the court to hold that it is impossible to reform and rehabilitate the offender after examining the matter with due regard to the age, character and antecedents of the offender and the circumstances in which the offence was committed. This is some indication by the legislature that reformation and rehabilitation of offenders and not mere deterrence, are now among the foremost objects of the administration of criminal justice in our country. (Para 236) Section 361 and Section 354(3) of the 1973 Code have both entered the statute- book at the same time and they are part of the emerging picture of acceptance by the legislature of the new trends in criminology. It would not, therefore, be wrong to assume that the personality of the offender as revealed by his age, character, antecedents and other circumstances and the tractability of the offender to reform must necessarily play the most prominent role in determining the sentence to be awarded. Special reasons must have some relation to these factors. Criminal justice deals with complex human problems and diverse human beings. A Judge has to balance the personality of the offender with the circumstances, situations and the reactions and choose the appropriate sentence to be imposed. (Para 236) Lehna v.

(Para 253) However, the mitigating circumstances need to be considered (and that too, liberally and expansively). (Para 254) Firstly, accused M's conduct appears to be disciplined, correctional in nature and overall satisfactory, barring one physical altercation during an earlier confinement period. He has a wife and two young children with whom he has repaired relations and is regularly in touch with. He makes special effort to be a part of his growing children's lives, demonstrating strong continued family ties.

The Probation Officer concludes that he seems remorseful, and keen to reintegrate into society with his family.

He has been voluntarily working as a health worker (based on his request) since 5-1-2021 wherein he helps transport sick inmates to the Jail Hospital. While in prison, he has completed 12th standard education, and proceeded to pursue BCom from IGNOU, New Delhi (in his final year). He actively participates in cultural and spiritual programmes conducted in the prison. His family consists of his ailing father, mother, and three married sisters. He expressed concern for his old parents and wished to help them financially by rejoining society. (Para 257) Prison record of third accused N reflects that she had, on a few occasions, got into fights and exchanged abuses with the other female inmates, and lady guard officers in the jail. After counselling, however, her conduct has improved and was found to be disciplined and corrective in nature. While in prison, she actively participates in cultural programmes, has undergone training for embroidery, knitting and lamination. In 2017, she received a national award for Jardosi work in Indore District Court and has received numerous other accolades for her participation in activities. In prison, she teaches children of other female inmates. Before detention, she was pursuing her BCom degree, which she completed in prison. Her family consists of her parents and two married brothers (of which one, is paralysed), who she is regularly in touch with. (Para 258) It is unfortunate to note that both the trial court, and the High Court, failed to provide an effective sentencing hearing to the accused, at the relevant stage, which is a right under Section 235(2) CrPC recognised by the Supreme Court in several cases. In fact, it was argued by the accused that the trial court in contravention of the Supreme Court's judgments, had proceeded to hear on sentencing almost immediately, depriving the accused of the opportunity to put forth their case for a less stringent sentence. The trial court order on sentencing, records in passing - the plea of \"young age\" and \"socio-economic factors\" as mitigating circumstances, but reflects, at best, a mechanical consideration of the same. Swayed by the brutality of the crime and \"shock of the collective and judicial conscience\", the High Court affirmed imposition of the death penalty solely on the basis of the aggravating circumstances of the crime, with negligible consideration of mitigating circumstances of the criminal. This is in direct contravention of Bachan Singh, (1980) 2 SCC 684.

STATE OF M.P. 361 The crime that the appellants have been held guilty of, is heinous; its execution was vicious and cruel, by any stretch of imagination. The deception practised by the appellants, in entering the flat, and, when encountering resistance, attacking the three women, was calculated and ruthless. The repeated stabbings of two of the deceased, almost in a frenzy, on the one hand, and the defenceless state of the victims, on the other, highlights that the accused were willing to go ahead with their plans ( of robbing) after eliminating the women of three generations. No doubt, two of the victims appear to have put up resistance, if one looks at the stab wounds inflicted all over their bodies, including on their arms and faces. Yet, they were unarmed and weak. (Para 260) At the same time, the young age of the accused at the time of the incident (35, 20, 22 respectively) and lack of criminal antecedents (except in the case of M, who was allegedly involved in a case of petty theft) cannot be lost sight of. Further, the prosecution case is silent on any real motive that may have instigated or moved the three accused to have preplanned for the commission of murder - other than robbery, itself. This coupled with the fact that R was shot in his leg during the commission of the crime, indicates that perhaps it is reasonable to assume that they were amateurs in a robbing-gone-wrong situation, who were not intent on taking the lives of these three women. One can surmise that having ventured to rob, perhaps they did not contemplate the kind of resistance that was put up by the victims, which led them to act the way they did, to continue with their plan, and ensure that the victims did not survive to tell the tale. (Para 261) The reports received from the Superintendent of Jail reflect that each of the three accused, have a record of overall good conduct in prison and display inclination to reform. It is evident that they have already, while in prison, taken steps towards bettering their lives and of those around them, which coupled with their young age unequivocally demonstrates that there is in fact, a probability of reform. On consideration of all the circumstances overall, the option of life imprisonment is certainly not foreclosed. (Para 262) While there is no doubt that this case captured the attention and indignation of the society in Indore, and perhaps the State of Madhya Pradesh, as a cruel crime that raised alarm regarding safety within the community - it must be remembered that public opinion has categorically been held to be neither an objective circumstance relating to crime, nor the criminal, and the courts must exercise judicial restraint and play a balancing role. (Para 263) In view of the totality of facts and circumstances, and for the abovestated reasons, the Supreme Court finds that imposition of death sentence would be unwarranted in the present case. It would be appropriate and in the overall interests of justice to commute the death sentence of all three accused, to life imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 years. (Para 264) Bachan Singh v.

On the contrary, it is the duty of the Public Prosecutor to winch it to the fore and make it available to the accused. (Para 199) Therefore, a Public Prosecutor has wider set of duties than to merely ensure that the accused is punished, the duties of ensuring fair play in the proceedings, all relevant facts are brought before the court in order for the determination of truth and justice for all the parties including the victims. It must be noted that these duties do not allow the Prosecutor to be lax in any of his duties as against the accused. (Para 200) Historically but consistently the view of the Supreme Court has been that an investigation must be fair and effective, must proceed in proper direction in consonance with the ingredients of the offence and not in haphazard manner. In some cases besides investigation being effective the accused may have to prove miscarriage of justice but once it is shown the accused would be entitled to definite benefit in accordance with law. The investigation should be conducted in a manner so as to draw a just balance between citizen's right under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution and expansive power of the police to make investigation. (Para 202) A concept of fair investigation and fair trial are concomitant to preservation of the fundamental right of the accused under Article 21 of the Constitution. The accused is not subjected to harassment, his right to defence is not unduly hampered and what he is entitled to receive in accordance with law is not denied to him contrary to law. (Para 202) In the present case, the trial court ought to have inquired more deeply into the role of DW 1, given that by her own deposition she had admitted to analysing call detail records and involvement in N's arrest - all of which had been suppressed by the prosecution side, for reasons best known to them. (Para 205) Section 91 CrPC empowers the court to summon production of any document or thing which the court considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or another proceeding under the provisions of CrPC. Where Section 91 read with Section 243 says that if the accused is called upon to enter his defence and produce his evidence there he has also been given the right to apply to the court for issuance of process for compelling the attendance of any witness for the purpose of examination, cross-examination or the production of any document or other thing for which the court has to pass a reasoned order. (Para 205) The provisions of Section 207 CrPC have a material bearing on this subject and make an interesting reading.

In contradistinction to the provisions of Section 173, where the legislature has used the expression \"documents on which the prosecution relies\" are not used under Section 207 CrPC. Therefore, the provisions of Section 207 CrPC will have to be given liberal and relevant meaning so as to achieve its object. Not only this, the documents submitted to the Magistrate along with the report under Section 173(5) would deem to include the documents which have to be sent to the Magistrate during the course of investigation as per the requirement of Section 170(2) CrPC. (Para 206) To claim documents within the purview of scope of Sections 207, 243 read with the provisions of Section 173 in its entirety and power of the court under Section 91 CrPC to summon documents signifies and provides precepts which will govern the right of the accused to claim copies of the statement and documents which the prosecution has collected during investigation and upon which they rely. (Para 206) It will be difficult for the Court to say that the accused has no right to claim copies of the documents or request the court for production of a document which is part of the general diary subject to satisfying the basic ingredients of law stated therein. A document which has been obtained bona fide and has bearing on the case of the prosecution and in the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, the same should be disclosed to the accused in the interest of justice and fair investigation and trial should be furnished to the accused. Then that document should be disclosed to the accused giving him chance of fair defence, particularly when non-production or disclosure of such a document would affect administration of criminal justice and the defence of the accused prejudicially. (Para 206) The concept of disclosure and duties of the Prosecutor under the English system cannot be made applicable to the Indian criminal jurisprudence stricto sensu at this stage. However, the doctrine of disclosure would have to be given somewhat expanded application. (Para 206) In this manner, the Public Prosecutor, and then the trial court's scrutiny, both play an essential role in safeguarding the accused's right to fair investigation, when faced with the might of the State's police machinery. (Para 207) Thus, it is held that the prosecution, in the interests of fairness, should as a matter of rule, in all criminal trials, comply with the above rule, and furnish the list of statements, documents, material objects and exhibits which are not relied upon by the investigating officer. The presiding officers of courts in criminal trials shall ensure compliance with such rules. (Para 209) Deepak Aggarwal v.

Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - Ss. 172(2) and 173(3) - Diary of proceedings in investigation - Powers of court to summon - Right of accused, if any, to access the same - Principles clarified Held: The scheme of the CrPC under Chapter XII (Information to Police and Powers to Investigate) is clear - the police have the power to investigate freely and fairly; in the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc. While the criminal court is empowered to summon these diaries under Section 172(2) for the purpose of inquiry or trial (and not as evidence), Section 173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely on it (to refresh their memory) or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police officers. (Para 203) The purpose and the object seems to be quite clear that there should be fairness in investigation, transparency and a record should be maintained to ensure a proper investigation. This object is rendered entirely meaningless if the police fail to maintain the police diary accurately. Failure to meticulously note down the steps taken during investigation, and the resulting lack of transparency, undermines the accused's right to fair investigation; it is up to the trial court that must take an active role in scrutinising the record extensively, rather than accept the prosecution side willingly, so as to bare such hidden or concealed actions taken during the course of investigation. (Para 204) Malkiat Singh v. State of Punjab, (1991) 4 SCC 341 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 976, relied on Manu Shanna v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2010) 6 SCC 1 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1385; Mukund Lal v.

But that is no ground to throw the case overboard, if true, in the main. If there is a ring of truth in the main, the case should not be rejected. It is the duty of the court to cull out the nuggets of truth from the evidence unless there is reason to believe that the inconsistencies or falsehood are so glaring as utterly to destroy confidence in the witnesses. It is necessary to remember that a Judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is punished. A Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. One is as important as the other. Both are public duties which the Judge has to perform. (Para 177) The defect in the investigation by itself cannot be a ground for acquittal.

(Para 178) The case of the prosecution must be judged as a whole having regard to the totality of the evidence. In appreciating the evidence, the approach of the court must be integrated not truncated or isolated. In other words, the impact of evidence in totality on the prosecution case or innocence of the accused has to be kept in mind in coming to the conclusion as to the guilt or otherwise of the accused. In reaching a conclusion about the guilt of the accused, the court has to appreciate, analyse and assess the evidence placed before it by the yardstick of probabilities, its intrinsic value and the animus of witnesses. (Para 179) State of U.P V. Anil Singh, 1988 Supp sec 686: 1989 sec (Cri) 48; C. Muniappan V. State of T.N., (2010) 9 sec 567 : (2010) 3 sec (Cri) 1402; Surajit Sarkar v.

Public Prosecutor, (2002) 6 SCC 470: 2002 SCC (Cri) 1370, affirmed The concealment of DW 1 's role in this case's investigation (her analysing of call detail records of the deceased and in connection to accused N-which was not produced in trial; tip-off allegedly received regarding N's whereabouts and what she would be wearing; participating in N's arrest, and subsequent involvement on 23-6-2011 in recoveries of articles) points to concerning gaps in the manner of investigation carried out initially, or at the very least, an untruthful recollection and presentation of it, for the purposes of trial. As elaborated earlier, these facts prompted the Supreme Court to draw adverse inferences against the prosecution's version of N ' s arrest. Other circumstances have been proved sufficiently to conclude their guilt and result in conviction. (Para 197) M. Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 302, 397 and 449 r/w S. 34 - Appreciation of evidence - Duty of Court in case of discrepancies/contradictions/omissions in depositions, reiterated - Evidence Act, 1872, S. 3 Held: If discrepancies in the depositions are minor, or that witnesses contradict themselves during their testimonies (as opposed to their previous police statements) what is important is the nature of contradictions. Courts should bear in mind that it is only when discrepancies in the evidence of a witness are so incompatible with the credibility of his version that the court is justified in jettisoning his evidence. But too serious a view to be adopted on mere variations falling in the narration of an incident ( either as between the evidence of two witnesses or as between two statements of the same witness) is an unrealistic approach for judicial scrutiny. (Para 180) The court while appreciating the evidence must not attach undue importance to minor discrepancies. The discrepancies which do not shake the basic version of the prosecution case may be discarded. (Para 181) The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses, therefore, does not ipso facto favour an accused. What is important, however, is whether the omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and incredulous. (Para 183) Rammi V.

During the hearing, the counsel for the appellants had repeatedly emphasised that elimination prints were not taken from others present at the crime scene; they also highlighted that fingerprints were not lifted from the knives, pistol and ornaments seized from the accused. (Para 127) In the opinion of the Supreme Court, nothing material turns on this aspect. What is important is whether the crime scene was secured, and whether the lifting of prints was witnessed. On both counts, the prosecution evidence is credible and worthy of acceptance. These are also corroborated by the testimony of PW 21, the Senior Scientific Officer, and the crime scene report dated 20-6-2021 (Ext. P- 77) tendered by him. (Para 128) Hari Om v.

P-85 to Ext. P-92 are photographs of the fingerprints lifted (these were annexed to the fingerprint report, Ext. P-84). The fingerprint report was enclosed with a letter (Ext. P-93). Given that the expert deposed to lifting the prints, which were corroborated by the three witnesses (PW 3, PW 5 and PW 9) apart from the IO, the credibility of this circumstance i.e. the lifting of the prints from the crime scene, their match with the sample prints of the accused, and the expert's testimony stand proved. Hence, the appellant's arguments questioning the credibility of this part, on the ground of delay in the report, is insubstantial and is rejected. (Paras 129 and 130) R.

(Para 152) DNA usually can be obtained from any biological material such as blood, semen, saliva, hair, skin, bones, etc. The question as to whether DNA tests are virtually infallible may be a moot question, but the fact remains that such test has come to stay and is being used extensively in the investigation of crimes and the court often accepts the views of the experts, especially when cases rest on circumstantial evidence. More than half a century, samples of human DNA began to be used in the criminal justice system. Of course, debate lingers over the safeguards that should be required in testing samples and in presenting the evidence in court. DNA profile, however, is consistently held to be valid and reliable, but of course, it depends on the quality control and quality assurance procedures in the laboratory. (Para 154) Like all other opinion evidence, the probative value accorded to DNA evidence also varies from case to case, depending on the facts and circumstances and the weight accorded to other evidence on record, whether contrary or corroborative. This is all the more important to remember, given that even though the accuracy of DNA evidence may be increasing with the advancement of science and technology with every passing day, thereby making it more and more reliable, the Supreme Court has not yet reached a juncture where it may be said to be infallible.

(Para 157) In the present case, what is apparent, is that PW 35 Dr P, Scientific Officer, DNA Fingerprint Unit FSL has virtually echoed the DNA analysis in his chief examination, and not chosen to elaborate on the random occurrence ratio i.e. the probability of the accused's samples matching with those allegedly found at the crime scene. The Supreme Court has already discussed whether the recoveries of 23-6-2011 pursuant to disclosures made that day can be accepted and held that they are suspect and need to be discarded. This leaves the report, to the extent it says that samples lifted from recoveries made at the crime scene matched with what was seized on 22-6-2011 (knives, and other articles), to be inconclusive. (Para 159) It is noteworthy that seizure Memo Ext. 27, in terms of which Article A-9 (ID 3063) is said to have been seized, does not record that as a matter of fact, a bedsheet was seized. If one keeps in mind that source H2 (ID 3078) in relation to Neha was seized on 23-4-2011, and from an open area, the likelihood of its contamination-even if arguendo the genuineness of its recovery might have been accepted-carried some degree of probability. For these reasons, it is held that the DNA report in the present case cannot have a clinching, or high degree of probative value. (Para 160) R v.

There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between \"may be proved\" and \"must be or should be proved\". Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between \"may be\" and \"must be\" is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions. (2) The facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty, (3) The circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency. (4) They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved, and (5) There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused. These five golden principles constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence. (Para 167) Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v.

Linked with this circumstance is the deposition of PW 27, a Bank of India, Ujjain official who deposed to issuing a letter to the SHO, (Ext. P-98), containing the ATM card numbers.

PW 24, the fingerprint expert, deposed to searching the crime scene for possibility of lifting impressions of fingerprints. A set of five fingerprints (i.e. Ext. P-80 chance fingerprints) were lifted by him which was witnessed by two witnesses (PW 5 and PW 9) who corroborated the fact. The Supreme Court has held, previously that the possibility of others' presence at the crime scene, and its contamination could be ruled out, because of the deposition of these two witnesses, as well as other depositions. PW 17 obtained the fingerprint samples of N (Ext. P-43), which he deposed to during the trial. The deficiencies alleged by the appellants, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, about the procedural lapses in the collection of such evidence, are not convincing. The evidence of PW 24, as well as his report (Ext. P-84) prove that a chance fingerprint (Sample E, collected from the crime scene) matched with the sample obtained from her, by PW 1 7 during the investigation. ( 4) The fourth circumstance, against N, which was established during the trial-and a vital one, is her knowledge of the crime. Her disclosure statement led to arrests of Rahul and Manoj, and recovery of stolen and other articles from their possession. (Para 188) As against R, the circumstances proved are: (1) Firstly, the circumstances relating to his arrest (witnessed by PW 3 and PW 6), on 22-6-2011 were proved by the prosecution. (2) The second circumstance proved is that his disclosure statement led to recovery and seizure of stolen articles and other articles connected with the crime (Ext. P-14), including two bent golden bangles, part of broken mangalsutra, a country-made pistol, a knife measuring 35.5 cm, and a photograph showing R wearing black diamond-like beaded bracelet. (3) The third circumstance is that, like with N, PW 1 identified the gold jewellery recovered from R's possession, during the TIP (further corroborated by PW 12). (4) The fourth circumstance proved is that PW 24 the fingerprint expert, deposed that he found that Prints A and B lifted from the crime scene (as corroborated by PW 5 and PW 9) matched with the index and middle fingerprints respectively of R's right hand, in the sample (Ext. P-41) collected from him by PW 17. (5) The fifth circumstance proved during the trial is that R had reported late in the evening of 19-6-2011, that he was shot on the right foot, by unknown persons. This was recorded in the form of a dehati nalisi against unknown persons; later an FIR (Ext. P-107) was registered by PW 30 for the offences punishable under Sections 294, 307 and 34 IPC. R was initially taken to District Hospital (proved by the treatment card Ext. P-97 dated 19-6-2011). R was however, referred to M.Y. Hospital, and examined by PW 32, who operated upon him. Ext. P-113 is the discharge card of M.Y. Hospital signed by PW 32 (who also deposed about it) on 20-6-2011. PW 29 who recorded the initial report dehati nalisi, also identified Ras the boy who had reported the incident. The bullet extracted from his foot was deposited (under memo Ext. P-113) in the Medico-Legal Cell of the hospital, and later seized (under memo Ext. P-108) on 23-6-2011. The FIR relating to this case was later closed.

(6) The sixth cir cumstance proved against R, which is material, is the ballistic report which stated that the two bullets (found at the crime scene) were compatible to the certified bullet of 7 .65 mm calibre cartridge; bullet TB-Al was found similar. Three pieces of skin were found copper positive. Importantly, according to the report, two bullets, EB2 and EB 1 (recovered from the body of M, the deceased, and R's right foot respectively) were fired from pistol Ext. A-1, seized from Rahul's house. The report also stated that the gunshot fired at the seized right shoe (mentioned above) was caused by a copper-jacketed bullet. All this was proved by the ballistics report (Ext. P-120) that had analysed each of these items. The report also revealed that the ballistics expert (PW 16) had test fired from the pistol sent to FSL , and had found that the pistol had signs that the two spent cartridges, were fired from it. (Para 189) As against M, the circumstances proved are: (1) The first circumstance proved against him, is his arrest and subse quent disclosure statement, at 10.05 a.m. on 22-6-2011 (proved by PW 3 and PW 6). (2) The second circumstance is the recovery and seizure of articles, at M' s behest, and from his possession, including - two golden bangles, portion of a broken mangalsutra, a knife and a photograph with M in sunglasses (Ext. P-17, also proved by same witnesses). (3) The third circumstance proved against Mis that PW 1 identified the golden jewellery recovered from his possession, during the TIP (corroborated by PW 12). (Para 190) Thus , it is held that all the circumstances and the link connecting them , was sufficiently established by the prosecution and proved beyond reasonable doubt. Similarly, every hypothesis suggesting the innocence of the appellants is ruled out by such evidence, and the irresistible inference which follows, is their guilt. (Para 191) Thus , the proof of the circumstances against the appellants clearly points to their guilt, and involvement in the crime. (Para 192) Information as to how these attacks occurred within the house of the deceased f and the distinct roles played by the accused, are in the special knowledge of only the accused; but no such information was forthcoming through the course of the trial or appellate stage.

Such witnesses have the habit of appearing suddenly on the scene when something is happening and then of disappearing after noticing the occurrence about which they are called later on to give evidence. (Para 102) The evidence of a chance witness requires a very cautious and close scrutiny and a chance witness must adequately explain his presence at the place of occurrence. Deposition of a chance witness whose presence at the place of incident remains doubtful should be discarded. (Para 104) The deposition of this witness (PW 10) cannot be taken at face value. PW 10 improved upon his statement made to the police and was confronted in this regard. His initial statement to the police did not mention the presence of the girl (whom he identified as Nin court). Likewise, he improves upon his statement, by deposing in court that the girl had asked two boys to take one injured seriously to the hospital. In addition, his contradictions as to what led him to the police station on 20-0-2011 - obtaining a gumasta licence, or to report the crime; and his presence at the scene of the crime - as a property broker checking vacancy of a property, who admittedly had no licence for this business, are material. These contradictions are serious inasmuch as they strike at the root of the witness's credibility. His prevarications and improvements especially about the presence of a girl are too serious and fundamental to overlook. Very crucially this witness appears to be a stock witness. For all the aforesaid reasons the depositions of PW 10 cannot be accepted. (Para 105) Puran v. State of Punjab, (1952) 2 SCC 454; Darya Singh v.

The witness, during his deposition stated that he had studied from a Science College in Pakistan. He admitted to not being licensed to practise medicine, by the Medical Council of India; he also admitted that he did not hold any permission to practise as a doctor, but ran Kavita clinic. He identified M in court, and said that on 19-6-2011, M had secured treatment for an injury on his elbow, and another boy (who spoke in Sindhi) accompanied him. He proved Ext. P-37, the slip issued by him, containing the prescription for M, which was seized on 25-6-2011 (Ext. P-36) by the 10 (PW 31), who deposed to it. (Para 106) PW 8 is not a reliable witness. Apart from the fact that he is admittedly an unqualified professional, and an unlicensed one - at best a quack, the appellants quite correctly point out that his previous links with the police cannot be ruled out, for the reason that he migrated, later than during Partition, from Pakistan. The probability of him practising his profession under the shadow of police patronage, for some kind of quid pro quo i.e. being a convenient witness, leaves a lurking suspicion. The police did not involve him during the test identification parade; admittedly, M was in fact taken to him during the investigation. In these circumstances, the testimony of this witness is not credible. This circumstance is therefore, held not to be proved. (Para 107) ZD.

TIPs should normally be conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses' memory. TIPs are conducted during investigation; however, there is no provision of law enabling an accused to claim it as a matter of right. There is no hard-and-fast rule that delay or failure in holding the TIP ipso facto renders the evidence inadmissible or unacceptable; it however, affects the credibility and weight attached to such identification. (Para 110) PW 10 omitted to mention basic details about the distance from between where he was, and where he saw the accused. Further, his account suggests that he apparently saw the accused, fleetingly. No attempt was made by the prosecution to draw a sketch or to show the approximate distance from where this witness (who is vital to its case) observed the accused. Given these facts, and the delay (unexplained by the prosecution, which had by its account, wrapped up the case by the end of June 2011) to conduct the TIP after the accused's arrest, renders the TIP suspect. It cannot be said that the TIPs conducted and the subsequent dock identification, by PW 10 of the accused, are among the circumstances proved beyond reasonable doubt. (Para 111) Malkhansingh v.

Penal Code, 1860 - Ss. 397 and 449 r/w S. 34 - Identity of looted articles - Challenge as to identification of jewellery items at TIP - When not tenable - Incident of looting certain articles including jewellery and killing wife, daughter and mother-in-law of PW 1 occurred in the rented house of the victims on 19-6-2011 - On 21-6-2011, PW 1 reported that 2 ATM cards, mobile, camera and specific jewellery items were missing from the premises - Said challenge made by contending that the articles were common pieces of jewellery, without any distinctive features and that PW 1 could hardly know these, particularly, jewellery of his mother-in-law - Held, if one keeps in mind that PW 1 had reported the loss of the articles, and listed them specifically, in his statement which was given to the police on 21-6-2011, their subsequent recovery, at the behest and pointing out of the accused, and their correct identification by PW 1 before PW 12, there cannot be doubts of its credibility, particularly when during his cross-examination, PW 1 was not questioned about how he could identify jewellery articles of his wife, daughter and mother-in-law - Evidence Act, 1872, S. 9 Held: There can be various reasons, why someone may be able to recollect or remember jewellery or other valuables. There cannot be any general assumption that a husband would not be able to remember or recollect the personal articles of his wife, or that a wife cannot be expected to recollect and identify the personal effects of her husband. It all depends on the personality and individual traits of human being, which uniquely differ from each other. It is possible that PW 1 had an eye for detail; it is equally possible that he was present when the valuables were bought; or yet, it is further possible that they were part of a set, presented to the deceased individuals. The recollection, reporting and identification of the mangalsutra, is more specific. PW 1 could reasonably be assumed to be aware of that article, belonging to M, his wife. In these circumstances, the evidence relating to the recovery of items belonging to the deceased, recovered from the accused's premises at their behest, and their correct identification by PW 1 during TIP were proved beyond reasonable doubt, by the prosecution.

The failure to examine AS therefore, was a lapse, but not a fatal one, as far as the TIP itself went. Likewise, the failure to examine PI is of no consequence, because the recoveries made on 23-6-2011 have not been accepted. The omission to examine Nk is also inconsequential, given the sequence of reporting of the crime, and the rapidity of the events which developed after it. No doubt, AT noticed the right shoe with a bullet hole, first; however, PW 20 was also with him; he deposed to the fact of its discovery and seizure. Similarly, the failure to examine Constable Dis also not fatal, given the testimony of PW 29 and PW 30. (Para 184) Even where a case hangs on the evidence of one eyewitness, it may be enough to sustain the conviction given sterling testimony of a competent, honest man although as a rule of prudence courts call for corroboration. It is a platitude to say that witnesses have to be weighed and not counted since quality matters more than quantity in human affairs. (Para 185) Conviction can be recorded on the basis of the statement of a single eyewitness provided his credibility is not shaken by any adverse circumstance appearing on the record against him and the court, at the same time, is convinced that he is a truthful witness. (Para 186) Therefore, unless it is shown that the omission to examine a witness, who had previously participated during the investigation and whose statement was recorded by the police, undermines the prosecution case, or impacts on it significantly, the foundation of the fact or facts which are sought to be proved, remains unshaken as long as that fact is deposed to or spoken about by other witnesses, whose testimonies are to be seen in their own terms. Therefore, the omission to examine the individuals left out, but who the prosecution claimed, had participated during the investigation, did not affect its case , as far as the circumstances held to have been established by it, are concerned.

Investigation started and on 22-6-2011 at around 6.00 a.m., PW 28 Vijay Chauhan while on patrolling duty, spotted Neha Verma outside an ATM near LIG, under suspicious circumstances. On receiving this information, the 10 (PW 31) along with PW 4 Banno Solanki and others, reached the spot. Neha Verma was searched. This yielded an ATM card, which belonged to the deceased Ashlesha. Neha was taken for questioning; her disclosure statements led to her subsequent arrest. Based on information she provided, the police recovered some robbed articles from her house. 5. Upon disclosure statements of Neha the other accused i.e. Rahul alias Govind and Manoj were arrested and from their possession the robbed jewellery, knife and a pistol was seized. Investigation revealed that during the alleged incident Rahul alias Govind inadvertently shot his own foot and recorded a false FIR in this regard at Annapurna Police Station by dehati nalisi dated 19-6-2011 5 against unknown persons. Accordingly, an FIR6 was registered by PW 30 ASI R.S. Makwana for the offences punishable under Sections 294, 307 and 34 IPC. Manoj was also injured during the incident and secured treatment from PW 8 Dr Achutmal Tejwani. The clothes and shoes worn by the accused were seized; and parts of the broke n and disposed mobile phone and camera were also recovered and seized pursuant to their disclosure statements. The appellants underwent identification parade. Their fingerprints were examined, the seized articles were sent for chemical and DNA test and permission for prosecution was taken . 6. After conclusion of investigation, the police filed a final report indicting the appellants for commission of offence under Sections 302, 397 and 449 IPC and Sections 25, 27 of the Arms Act. The trial court framed charges against the accused under Sections 397 /34 in alternative Sections 302/34 and 449 IPC, and besides these charges Manoj was charged under Section 25(1-B)(b) of the Arms Act, 1959 and Rahul alias Govind was charged under Sections 25(1-B)(b) and 27 of the Arms Act. All the appellants abjured their guilt and claimed trial. 7. The prosecution examined 36 witnesses and produced certain documents (Exts. P-1 to P-129) in support of their case. After recording the evidence of prosecution, the appellants' statements were recorded under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code (\"CrPC\"). The appellants examined a total of 6 defence witnesses and produced certain documents (Exts. D-1 to D-50) in support of their case. 5 Ext. P-103C. 6 Ext.

As the entire case was based on circumstantial evidence, upon appreciation of the material evidence adduced by the prosecution, the trial court concluded that the accused persons were present at the scene of occurrence on 19-6-2011 at about 5.00-5.15 p.m. and that evidence of experts who lifted the fingerprints of the accused (from the house) along with the testimonies of PW 1, PW 2, PW 5, PW 9 and PW 31 proved that they had entered into the house. Upon recovery of the knife and firearm which caused the death, it was established by way of chemical, DNA as well as ballistic examination that those articles were used and that during the sequence of the incident, blood of the deceased persons was found on the clothes of the accused persons. The trial court further concluded that the footprints at the crime scene were similar to those of the shoes recovered from the accused persons, and the gunshot injury caused by the bullet which hit the foot of Rahul alias Govind as well as the bullet which hit the body of the deceased, were fired from the same weapon, which was recovered from his possession. It was held that this left no doubt in establishing the guilt of Rahul and Manoj, and during the whole incident. The evidence also proved Neha's presence at that time. The trial court held that this established her involvement in the crime along with the accused persons; every hypothesis of the innocence of the accused was ruled out. 9. After considering the evidence on record, the trial court convicted the appellants of committing the offences they were charged with. On the point of sentence, the trial court took the view that given the magnitude and diabolic manner in which the offences were committed, the case on hand fell under the category of the rarest of the rare case and warranted death penalty. High Court's findings confirming the trial court's order 10. The Division Bench of the High Court3 confirmed the sentences imposed on the appellants and the reference made by the trial court was answered in the affirmative. The High Court concluded that the forensic experts as well as the neighbours and the investigating officer had seen the bloodstained floor, walls, and bedsheets, and that the evidence produced on record with respect to them did not leave any major lacuna in the case of the prosecution; further, the presence of the accused in the house, their intention of committing such a heinous crime, and the manner in which the accused persons had caused the death, had been duly proved. 11. The High Court relied upon the statements of fingerprint expert, PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi who visited the site and lifted the chance fingerprints which matched with the appellants ' fingerprints, as well as jewellery recovered from their possession which was identified by PW 1 and PW 3 as belonging to the deceased. The weapons (knife and country-made pistol) used for the commission of the offence were recovered from the accused and the same was proved. Also, the accused persons were duly identified in open court by the witnesses pursuant to their depositions. 3 Manoj v.

The High Court further h eld that the accused, during their examination under Section 313 CrPC failed to explain their conduct and even gave incorrect and false answers. It therefore affirmed the trial court's conclusions and findings. 13. Upon examination of whether this case would fall in the category of \"the rarest of the rare cases\" to justify the imposition of capital punishment on the appellants, the High Court was of the view that as the incident shook the collective conscience of the community and the acts of murder committed by the appellants were so gruesome, merciless and brutal, the aggravating circumstances far outweighed the mitigating circumstances and hence , this case fell under the category of the rare st of the rare case which manifests society ' s abhorrence of such crime. Contentions on behalf of the appellants 14. Ms Anjana Prakash, learned Senior Counsel appearing pro bono for Rahul and Manoj, contended that the evidence of witnesses i.e. police witnesses and private witnesses in this case raise questions as to whether Neha was arrested at the time and at the spot claimed by the prosecution, whether her disclosure statements were genuine, whether the disclosures were made as claimed, and whether subsequent arrests and recoveries were in the manner claimed by the prosecution. 15. It was urged that PW 4 lady constable Banno Solanki deposed to having gone to the ATM machine, searched Neha, leading to recovery of Ashlesha's ATM card. However, she contradicted the 10 and other witnesses about the place of her interrogation. PW 4 deposed that Neha was interrogated at the police station where she said that some ornaments and ATM cards were in her house. This was confirmed by PW 6 Triyambak alias Prafulla and PW 36 Mulayam Singh Yadav. However, the prosecution did not explain why no arrest memo/information memo was prepared at the police station. It is argued that this is pertinent as there is a serious dispute about the arrests and recoveries itself, as also the manner claimed by the prosecution. Also , PW 4 the female constable e scorting the female accused, did not corroborate the prosecution that any recoveries were made from Neha's house after her interrogation. She was silent about whether she was part of the police team which went to the house of Neha in her examination-in-chief. In cross-examination she deposed to sitting in the same vehicle as Neha while going to her house. The presence of PW 4 is only confirmed by witnesses of the search team (i.e. PW 3 Dr Deepak Harl Ranadey and PW 31 10 Mohan Singh). PW 4 further did not support the prosecution that Neha had disclosed the names of Rahul and Manoj or having accompanied Neha (which would be expected, the accused being a woman) to the house of the two accused and the resulting subsequent recoveries. She deposed that the police party returned to the police station from Neha's house in the private vehicle. This suggests that the arrest memo (Ext. P-9) and information memo (Ext. P-10) made at that time and place is false and as a result, the subsequent story of Neha leading the police party to the houses of Rahul and Manoj are also false. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 389 16. It was further stated that PW 31 deposed that PW 28 Vijay Chauhan, informed PW 19 Y.R. Gaikwad, about spotting a girl standing suspiciously a near an ATM for which PW 19 made a station diary entry and informed him via wireless. PW 31 therefore went to the police station, constituting a team - comprising himself, PW 4, PW 19, PW 28 and PW 36 - which left for the ATM spot and thereafter to Neha's house (and those of Rahul and Manoj). It is submitted that neither was the station diary produced, nor did PW 19 corroborate the deposition of PW 31 at all. Likewise, there was variance b between the statements of PW 28 and PW 31, on whether he was in the raiding party that went to Neha's house. 17. The counsel further argued that PW 31 deposed about various persons accompanying him, when he learnt about N eha loitering suspicious! y. However, he omitted to mention PW 19, who received information and told him about Neha's movement, at PW 28's behest. This suggests that Neha was in fact, c interrogated at the police station. So, there was no reason for not preparing an arrest memo or recording disclosure statement at that point in time, in the police station itself, even though the ATM card had been recovered. PW 31 did not offer any explanation as to why the disclosure was made on the way in the police vehicle. The counsel also referred to PW 4's deposition, which was silent on this aspect. Furthermore, the counsel highlighted that though family members, d particularly Neha's father were available, they were not intimated about her arrest, nor were their signatures taken on the arrest memo. It was urged that all these in fact corroborate the defence submission that Neha's arrest did not take place as contended by the prosecution. e f g h 18. Moving on to the arrest of Rahul and Manoj, some discrepancies in the form of injuries found on their person and the manner their occurrence was recorded before their disclosure statements (Exts. P-12 and P-13 in the case of Rahul and Exts. P-15 and P-16 in the case of Manoj), were pointed out. How these injuries occurred in fact was recorded before the disclosure statement. It was submitted that after Neha's arrest, recoveries were made from Rahul's house (Ext. P-14) at 9.10 a.m. Here, Ext. P-12 i.e. arrest memo dated 22-6-2011 of Rahul alias Govind made no mention of any injury on Rahul' s foot despite mentioning an old firearm wound on the left elbow in Column 9 of the arrest memo, which is where the police noted the injuries. It was urged that this was an irreconcilable circumstance against the prosecution's case that Rahul had a bullet injury on his left leg. 19. It was submitted that Manoj 's arrest then took place at 10.05 a.m. from his house (Ext. P-15). His disclosure statement was recorded at 10.15 a.m. (Ext. P-16) and seizures were made at 10.35 a.m. (Ext. P-17). The arrest memo of Manoj (Ext. P-15), however, does not record the injury on the elbow even while it notes signs of an injury on the nose in Column 9 of the arrest memo which is where the police is supposed to record injuries present on the body of the accused at the time of arrest. The prosecution case is that on 22-6-2011 from 6.00 a.m. till 4.40 p.m. various seizures were made and documents were prepared. However, there is evidence to show that a press conference was held in the office ofDW 3 Sanjay Rana, IG, lndore between 12.30 p.m. to post 1.00 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

This falsifies the story of the recovery of shoe at the instance ofRahul Ext. P-21 [reliance is placed on DW 3 and DW 5]. 20. Ms Prakash contended that PW 31 10 deposed to interrogating Rahul on 23-6-2011 before two witnesses - but did not name them. Rahul reportedly disclosed that he had kept his clothes and knife in a bag in his motorcycle and Manoj had broken the stolen mobile and camera and thrown them near a Maruti showroom. He then prepared the information memo (Ext. P-28) at 7 .50 a.m. He interrogated Manoj in the presence of two witnesses (who he did not name) who allegedly confessed that he had concealed the clothes and shoes worn by him in his father's almirah and had thrown a broken mobile near the Maruti showroom at Rau. He then prepared information memo (Ext. P-31), recorded at 8.05 a.m. PW 31 also interrogated Neha in the presence of two witnesses (who were again, not named) who revealed that she had kept her clothes and sandals worn by her in the dicky of her Scooty. He then prepared information memo (Ext. P-34) at 8.15 a.m. It was submitted that since the accused had made their disclosures on the date of their arrest, it appears strange and unnatural that truncated recovery statements would be given at different stages of investigation. The counsel urged that there was no explanation as to why PW 31 10 does not reveal either the time of recording of statements or the names of the witnesses. 21. Commenting on the recoveries made on 23-6-2011, it was submitted that no explanation was furnished as to why truncated recoveries were made on different dates, as was claimed by the prosecution. Further, the witne ss to these recoveries PW 7 Sandeep Narulkar, appears to be a stock witness who stated that he reached the police station at 8.45 a.m. on 23-6-2011 i.e. after the disclosure statements (Exts. P-28, P-31 and P-34) were recorded. In the chief examination, this witness deposed that Rahul disclosed before him that he could get the clothes, knife, lens of camera recovered. Manoj disclosed keeping his clothes in his father's house and Neha about having kept her clothes in her vehicle parked behind a hospital. Then police prepared memos Exts. P-28, P-31 and P-34 respectively and recovered articles of which memos were prepared as Exts. P-29, P-31 & P-34 respectively. It is pointed out that PW 7 does not say anything about a lady police officer in the team which would have been required on account of involvement of female accused Neha. It was urged that non- examination of the other witness (Prakash Ichke) assumes great significance and without any explanation for his non-e x amination it cannot be said that the recoveries are reliable. 22. The counsel casts serious doubts as to the recovery by police on 22-6-2011 and 23-6-2011. She particularly pointed to the fact that a photograph ofRahul wearing a black-beaded bracelet was found from his house and seized as E x t. P-14. This was not made pursuant to any disclosure and apparently was seized during the process of seizing other items. During the cross-examination of PW 31 10, a suggestion was made that this picture was clicked when the bracelet was forced to be worn by the accused. The 10 denied the suggestion. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

This was in the course of his disclosure statement leading to recovery of other articles. However, in Rahul's case, there was no disclosure statement. Neither of the seizure memos mentioned from where in the premises, these articles were found. Further, the recoveries were not spoken about in the depositions of the recovery witnesses. 23. It was next argued that neither PW 3 nor PW 6 said anything regarding the sealing of the seized items (Exts. P-11, P-14 and P-17) in their presence on 22-6-2011 and 23-6-2011. Similarly, the witness (for recoveries made on 23-6-2011) PW 7, did not mention who placed seals on the items Exts. P-29, P-30, P-32, P-33 and P-35. PW 6 could not recollect the sealing of the articles on 22-6-2011. Likewise in Ext. P-35 disclosure by Neha and recovery of items on 23-6-2011 do not mention the sealing of the items. The counsel also compared the depositions of the panch witnesses with the evidence of PW 12 Tahsildar and PW 36 Mulayam Singh Yadav (Head Constable, MIG). It was submitted that these witnesses nowhere mentioned the particulars of sealing, what kind of seals were placed or the signatures of persons, who had witnessed the recovery and sealing of the articles. It is therefore argued that the recoveries on 22-6-2011 are unreliable. 24. The learned counsel submitted that in all likelihood, the accused were in police custody for a longer period than what was projected, which raises doubts over the veracity and voluntariness of the disclosure statements by them. She also submitted that recoveries of next day i.e. 23-6-2011 are similarly unreliable as they were not recorded in the presence of witnesses PW 7 and Prakash Ichke. PW 7 arrived at the police station that day at 8.45 a.m., the disclosure statements however were recorded earlier between 7.50 and 8.15 a.m. - evidenced by Exts. P-28, P-31 and P-34. Signatures of the witnesses were taken on those documents. It was submitted that the oral evidence completely undermines and falsifies preparation of documents at the date and time mentioned. Therefore, recoveries are dubious inasmuch as they purport to have been made pursuant to disclosure statements on the same day, which were recorded before the witnesses even reached the police station. Another suspicious circumstance according to the counsel was that recoveries were made in the afternoon, starting from 2.45 p.m. after a gap of 6 hours. The timing of Exts. P-29, P-30, P-32, P-33 and P-35, are shown in this regard. It is argued that when the disclosure statements were recorded latest at 8.15 a.m., the police did not offer any explanation why the recoveries took place in the afternoon only after a lapse of six hours. 25. It was further submitted that recoveries are also suspect because the details were published in newspapers, both on 22-6-2011 and 23-6-2011. The learned counsel relied on Ext. D-4, published on 22-6-2011 which mentions the recovery of a pistol and knife from the accused. These recoveries were made that day at 9.30 a.m. and 10.35 a.m. Importantly, the learned counsel argued that the chain of custody of the shoe allegedly belonging to Rahul which was seized from an open place within jurisdiction of Annapurna Police Station on 22-6-2011 as propounded by the prosecution, is suspect as it was ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

D-6 in this regard. 26. It was next pointed out that the accused were produced before a Magistrate on 23-6-2011. The record reveals that the arrests were made in the morning of 22-6-2011, and several articles were seized pursuant to the disclosure statements of the accused and consequently, recoveries effected. However, the Magistrate was not shown these articles nor was any memo produced before the Magistrate at the time of the production of the accused on 23-6-2011. This procedural irregularity as highlighted by the Senior Counsel is contrary to Section 102(3) CrPC which requires every police officer to forthwith report seizure of any article to a Magistrate having jurisdiction. The counsel relies on Umesh Tukaram Padwal v. State of Maharashtra 7 , to say that non-compliance is fatal to the prosecution story. 27. Ms Prakash also contended that PW 10 Dilip Sen is a chance witness whose testimony is unreliable because it contains contradictions and material improvements. It contains a material contradiction regarding his reporting to the police about seeing all the three accused. In his examination-in-chief, he stated that he read about the incident in the newspaper and therefore, went and informed the police about the incident. In his cross-examination, however, he said that he did not read the newspaper and went to the police station without reading the newspaper. He also mentions going to the police station for another reason (to get a gumasta licence) and upon overhearing discussions going on there about this case, he volunteered information. Further his testimony is unbelievable as, given the description of the scene of crime, the clothes of the accused should have also been smeared with blood. The recovery memos of the clothes of the accused (Exts. P-29, P-32 and P-35) show that the clothes worn by the accused on the day of the incident were light in colour on which blood would have been easily visible. Moreover, PW 10 explained his presence near the place of occurrence since he wanted to check if House No. 23 was available for rental purposes. However, the prosecution has not sufficiently established his pre sence near the place of occurrence as the owner of House No. 23 was not examined and no other evidence was led to confirm the presence of PW 10 at the place of occurrence. PW 10 further improved from his statement under Section 161 CrPC (Ext. D-7) with respect to Neha's presence at the place. 28. Likewise, the learned counsel submitted that PW 8 Achyutmal Tejwani (whose deposition was relied on by the prosecution, to say that he treated Manoj), is an unreliable witness. His credentials as a medical practitioner, were doubted: the counsel relied on the witnesses' cross-examination and submitted that this witness had migrated to India from Pakistan, and in all probability was beholden to the police . 29. The learned counsel submitted that the delay of 25 days in conducting the test identification parade (\"TIP\") is unexplained. The delay assumes significance since unveiled photographs of the accused were published across newspapers starting from 23-6-2011.

Furthermore, it was submitted that the procedure of the TIP was questionable as Rahul and Manoj were made to stand together in the TIP line-up. The identification memo does not record the appearances of the other persons. Ms Prakash submitted that Rahul and Manoj do not look similar - she relied on the arrest memos Exts. P-12 and P-15 to support her argument. PW 10 in his cross-examination stated that some persons were tall, others were short; some were fair and others, dark. Therefore, the combined TIP procedure was faulty and could not have been relied on. In this regard, the counsel relied on Lal Singh v. State of U.P. 8 , Muthuswami v. State of Madras 9 and Mohd. Abdul Hafeez v. State of A.P. 10 to say that in the absence of individual distinguishing features, a TIP of the accused conducted after a relatively long time may not be relied upon by the courts. 30. The learned Senior Counsel submitted that there was serious doubt about the identity of Rahul , who was referred to as \"Govind\" in all documents until the preparation of his arrest memo Ext. P-12 on 22-6-2011. There was no reason why an alias for Rahul was associated with him in the arrest memo. This raises doubt about the identity of the individual. All documents relating to the medical treatment for the bullet injury as well as the case proceeding (Crime No. 377 /2011 registered by PW 29 crucially on the date of occurrence) refer to him as Govind. These were Ext. P-103 - dehati nalisi at 10.30 p.m. on 19-6-2011; Ext. P-97 - letter of police to District Hospital and report of District Hospital, lndore after examination of wounds and referring him to M.Y. Hospital; Ext. P-104 - crime details recorded at 11 p.m. on 19-6-2011; Ext. P-105 - FIR of the shooting incident at 12.15 a.m. on 20-6-2011; Ext. P-101 - case closure report on 29-6-2011; Ext. P-113 at M.Y. Hospital signed by PW 32 Dr Nilesh Guru on 20-6-2011. 31. The learned counsel submitted that the non-identification by the treating doctors (PW 26 and PW 32) ofRahul, or even of PW 30 R.S. Makwana ( of PS Annapurna) in TIP or in court, on the one hand, and his identification by PW 29 Gourishankar Chadar (of PS Annapurna) in court as Govind alias Rahul, assumes significance . Rahul was allegedly admitted in M.Y. Hospital and there was ample opportunity for the treating doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff to identify him. Their omission to do so, raises serious doubts. 32. Ms Prakash argued that material was suppressed regarding admission in hospital. In this regard, it is pointed out that Ext. P-113 only mentions the date of admission as 20-6-2011 and the name of the patient is mentioned as Govind. There is no information on record regarding the treatment given to him and the time of his discharge. This is more crucial as no one from the hospital has deposed in order to prove the identity of the person being treated. Likewise, chain of custody of the bullet extracted from Rahul was not proved. In this regard it was contended that PW 32 Dr Nilesh Guru extracted the bullet and s (2003) 12 sec 554: 2004 sec (Cri) Supp 489 9 1951 sec 1020 : AIR 1954 SC 4 10 (1983) 1 sec 143 : 1983 sec (Cri) 139 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

A sealed bullet was collected by PW 30 from M.Y. Hospital from an unknown doctor on 23-6-2011 . The bullet was not sealed in front of PW 30. Therefore, there is no evidence on record to prove who sealed the bullet and when. 33. It was urged that the Magistrate's remand order dated 23-6-2011 omits mentioning of any injuries, especially on Appellant 2 Rahul alias Govind which would have been visible since he had been hospitalised. Furthermore, no MLCs of the accused persons were produced during the trial. It was also contended that the prosecution version regarding reporting of a false case and seeking medical treatment and informing PS Annapurna to alert them of the bullet by Rahul is unbelievable. Ext. P-97 shows that it was prepared at PS Annapurna. From the document it appears that Govind was sent to District Hospital with a forwarding letter that curiously has a note seeking opinion on whether the injury is self-inflicted. This directly contradicts the story of PW 29 that Rahul alias Govind had shouted and alerted the police that he was going to District Hospital. 34. In terms of Ext. P-104 Rahul had signed the spot map prepared on 19-6-2011 at 11.00 p.m. However, it is also the case of the prosecution that Rahul was going to get his injured foot treated and was admitted in hospital during that time. It appears that Constable Dinesh took Rahul to District Hospital and subsequently to M.Y. Hospital. That constable has not been examined and no reasons for non-examination were given. The learned counsel submitted that there is no material about how Rahul went from District Hospital to M.Y. Hospital with a gunshot injury, or who took him from District Hospital to M.Y. Hospital and who conducted his x-ray. 35. It was next argued that as far as seizure memo of the right shoe is concerned, the memo (Ext. P-75) was drawn at PS Annapurna at the behest of Abhay Tiwari, who too was not examined by the prosecution. This makes the contents of the document inadmissible. PW 20 Harbhajan Singh did not remember the logo on the shoe. He also did not depose as to which foot (left or right foot) did the shoe fit, or its size. He did not say whether it was a sports or leather shoe and also does not describe laces. PW 20 deposed that it was seized in his presence, however, he does not mention whether the same was sealed in front of him. PW 29 merely described that Abhay Tiwari found the shoe and it was contended that this was hearsay evidence. Importantly, there was no inquiry by the prosecution to prove that the seized shoe was even the same size as Rahul alias Govind' s. His foot size could have been measured under Sections 2(a) and 4 of the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920 which was not done. 36. It was next urged that there were serious gaps in the TIP of the jewellery held on 9-7-2011 by PW 12 Tahsildar. In this regard, it was pointed that PW 3 Deepak Ranade deposed that those two bangles were removed from Rohini' s hand and one kudi (earring) was removed from her body and handed over to him.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 395 four (4) bangles and Rohini's two (2) bangles. It is unclear if bangles identified by PW 1 included those handed over to PW 3. Further, if the bangles of deceased Rohini given to PW 3 were not the same as those identified by PW 1, the two recovered bangles from the accused were not matched with those given to PW 3. It was also unclear if the jewellery was mixed with other items having similar designs, as required by law. Similar pieces of broken mangalsutra should have been kept during the identification proceedings as well. Further, the identification memo (Ext. P-1) did not indicate how many similar pieces of jewellery were mixed along with the jewellery identified. There is discrepancy in the evidence of PW 1 and PW 3 as to what was said to have been stolen when questioned on 21-6-2011. According to PW 3, on 21-6-2011 when he went along with PW 1 to the house of the deceased, PW 1 only informed about the missing camera. 37. Challenging reliance on the DNA analysis report, the counsel submitted that there was inordinate delay in sending items to the forensic science laboratory (\"FSL\"). The items seized on 23-6-2011 were sent for examination to the FSL on 13-7-2011 (after 20 days) as seen by Ext. P-115. This delay was not explained by the prosecution. Therefore, it was urged that records of the police malkhana and conditions of safekeeping of items were important in this case. Also, statistical analysis was not conducted which is an integral part of the scientific process. The lack of cross-examination of the DNA expert PW 35 Dr Pankaj Shrivastava on this was argued to be immaterial since this goes to admissibility of the DNA report as scientific evidence and this Court should consider this serious gap in the scientific process. The counsel submitted that blood reference samples of the deceased were not collected and tested. The blood collected on cotton swabs found next to the dead bodies at the crime scene were used as reference samples, which is unreliable. Lastly, the counsel urged that no laboratory records were submitted - PW 35 mentioned that in the observation sheet details of the samples received and the testing were noted. This sheet was not submitted with the laboratory report. Also, electropherograms were not submitted with the laboratory reports. 38. Turning next to the ballistic reports and the prosecution's claim that the bullet extracted from Rahul's foot, and that recovered from Megha's body were fired from the same weapon, it was argued, that these circumstances were not proved, because of the unreliability with regard to the manner of Rahul's arrest, doubts about his identity, manner of seizure of the bullet from his foot, its sealing, custody, and production in court. The counsel submitted that the articles were received by the ballistic expert only on 14-7-2011; the ballistics report Ext. P-120 is dated 30-7-2011. 39. Doubts were expressed about seals on the items seized from the crime scene, which included the fired cartridges. According to the counsel their consequent matching with the test fire cartridge was unreliable. It was urged that the presence of copper during the chemical analysis of the shoe is unreliable since the shoe was seized at Annapurna PS and the witness Abhay Tiwari was not examined. Further, the live cartridge's primer cap (seized from the place of occurrence) had fallen during examination by PW 16 Bheem B ahadur who ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 396 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec was from the Arms Branch and had sealed the cartridge. He, however, did not say that he had reloaded it. During the ballistics examination however, it was found that Article A-6 contained a live 7.65 mm calibre pistol cartridge which a was marked LRl (in Ext. P-120). The description of LRl states that it is a reloaded live cartridge. The seals of the Arms Branch on the live bullet were intact when they were sent to the FSL on 13-7-2011 (Ext. P-115). These facts raised doubts about the chain of custody of Article A-6 (the live cartridge) given the discrepancies in its condition. Further, it is unclear as to what was used for the test firing by the FSL: if the live cartridge was used, it would not be possible b since the primer cap had fallen off, making it unusable. The report (Ext. P-120) did not mention the use of another test ammunition for the firing test, whose description should have been provided as part of the report to ensure that the same ammunition is being used. The counsel submitted that the fired cartridges found at the left side and the legs of the deceased were not photographed - as evident from scene of crime report (Ext. P-77) and crime scene photos (Ext. c P-56). PW 9 did not see the bullet in his hand and said that it was small in size. It is not explained how he recalls the calibre (KF 7 .65) written on the bullet and fired cartridge. 40. The learned Senior Counsel submitted that the circumstances relating to lifting of fingerprints, their being forwarded for expert examination, and the report, were not proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is urged that with regard d to chance prints found at the place of occurrence, PW 5 Vishal Pandey did not mention signing of the fingerprint slips. Elimination prints were not taken from anyone present at the crime scene. To prove that fingerprints were of the accused, the identity of the specimen prints were not proved since neither the signature of the accused nor their photographs were affixed on Exts. P-41, P-42, orP-43, contrary to what was stated by PW 13 Vijay Singh Chauhan (constable) e who mentioned that he took signatures of the accused persons. The specimen prints were not taken before the Magistrate on 23-6-2011, and rather on the next day (24-6-2011) at PS MIG. Sending of fingerprints for examination: no witness (PW 13, PW 24, or PW 31) has deposed anything suggesting that prints were sent to the fingerprint branch in a sealed condition. The rule of prudence of taking prints before the Magistrate under Section 5 of the Identification f of Prisoners Act, 1920 was breached. Further, specimen fingerprints of the accused were sent to the fingerprint branch after an unexplained delay of 3 days i.e. 27-6-2011 despite both departments being in Indore. The fingerprint expert's report (Ext. P-84) is not credible because elimination of the deceased's prints was not explained by PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi (fingerprint expert) or in his report Ext. P-84. Only the final conclusion of elimination has been g written about. There is no scientific evidence that fingerprints are unique for all individuals and therefore, heavy reliance cannot be placed on it. It is only corroborative in nature. Further, the counsel highlighted that the fingerprints were not lifted from the knives, pistol and ornaments seized from the accused. The counsel relied on Mohd. Aman v. State of Rajasthan 11 and Chandran v. 11 (1997) 10 sec 44: 1997 sec (Cri) 777 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The learned Senior Counsel then argued that the shoeprint report (Ext. P-125) mentioned that the chance shoeprints were incomplete and unclear, despite which the expert proceeded with the examination and came to a finding of the prints being identical to F6 (right), G4 (right), and H3 (which does not specify which side, as per Ext. 125). Rahul's foot impression was not taken as per Section 4 read with Section 2(a) of the Identification of Prisoners Act along with Rule 822(4) of the M.P. Police Regulations Rules. It was urged that this was important in proving that Rahul wore shoe size 44. PW 5 mentioned that there was a lot of blood on the floor. Elimination prints of shoes were not collected from PW 5 or anyone else present at the scene of occurrence. At this point it is worth noting that among others, five persons had entered the place of occurrence to act as witnesses to the inquest proceedings. The scene of crime report (Ext. P-77) mentioned that the shoeprints were bloodied and partial in nature. All these cast doubts about authenticity and reliability of the footprint expert's report. 42. Mr Shri Singh, learned counsel arguing pro bono on behalf of the appellant Neha, supplemented the contentions of Ms Anjana Prakash. He questioned the prosecution version about Neha's arrest. He submitted that officially Neha's arrest memo (Ext. P-9) was prepared at Devendra Nagar. When N eha was arrested, a personal seizure memo (Ext. P-10) and a disclosure memo (Ext. P-11) was prepared. No explanation as to why Neha's search outside the ATM (Ext. P-22) did not yield the phone seized through Ext. P-9, was given. PW 31 10 admitted that this was not recorded in Neha's arrest memo. Pertinently, the prosecution neither conducted a technical investigation of the seized phone nor provided any explanation as to why investigation was not conducted in this regard. Further, DW 1 SI Deepika Shinde admitted to conducting an analysis of the CDRs 13 . The CDRs were not produced before the trial court. 43. It was urged that these omissions impel the Court to draw an adverse inference, under Section 114(g) of the Evidence Act, 1872 against the police, casting grave doubt over Neha's apprehension, her arrest, and subsequent recoveries. Reliance is placed in this regard on Noor Aga v. State of Punjab 14 and Chunthuram v. State of Chhattisgarh 15. 44. The learned counsel further argued that PW 4 Banno Solanki (lady constable) was cross-examined on 30-9-2011 i.e. just three months after the incident. In cross-examination, the suggestion given was that Neha was brought to the police station on the evening of21-6-2011 by DW 1 SI Deepika Shinde. PW 4 was silent regarding her role in searching Neha' s residence on 22-6-2011, 12 1991 Supp (1) sec 39: 1991 sec (Cri) 245 13 Call detail records, which list out the incoming and outgoing calls received and made from the instrument. 14 c2008) 16 sec 417: c2010) 3 sec (Cri) 748 15 c2020) 10 sec 733 : c2021) 1 sec (Cri) 9 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 398 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec though she claimed she was present during Neha's apprehension earlier. PW 28, during cross-examination about DW l 's role, deposed that he and DW 1 received an out-of-turn promotion. PW 6, too during cross-examination, admitted that DW 1 was a part of the raiding team. These facts were effaced from the record. This was consistently the line of defence during the trial. Both courts below disregarded this aspect of Neha's defence - though the involvement of DW 1, in the investigation of this case was proved conclusively. Further, despite several opportunities, the prosecution failed to explain the acts of DW 1 during the investigation, or why her role was specifically erased. Reliance is placed in this regard on Reena Hazarika v. State of Assam 16 . It was urged that this warrants adverse inference against the prosecution, creating doubt over its reliability. 45. It was argued that the testimony of DW 1 Deepika Shinde in fact shows that technical evidence was analysed on the date of the incident itself. This does not square with the complete absence of telephonic evidence in the testimonies of the investigating team including PW 4, PW 28, PW 31. Telephonic evidence about whether the accused spoke to each other, or knew each other, or whether the deceased spoke to any of the accused, or the triangulation of location was not collected during the investigation and has been kept out of the trial. It was urged that in its place, this Court now had to rely upon the ipse dixit of the investigation team, knowing that electronic evidence was not only available, but was surreptitiously used to Neha's detriment. It was pointed out that PW 31 10 made no reference to the presence of officials of the Crime Branch on 19-6-2011, 20-6-2011 , or 21-6-2011. However, PW 28, Vij ay Singh Chauhan made reference to his Crime Branch posting, and informing PW 19 Y.R. Gaikwad, what he (i.e. PW 28) saw on 22-6-2011. However, PW 19 in his testimony was silent on receiving any information from PW 28 on 22-6-2011. DW l 's capacity for conducting investigation was questioned on the ground that the CrPC does not permit parallel/multiple investigations in the same case. 46. It was submitted that despite recovery of the \"Oriflame\" document from Neha, the prosecution did not rely on the document as an exhibit. The prosecution did not examine any official from the company to provide any context whatsoever as to the forms, catalogue or, perfume recovered from Neha's residence on 22-6-2011 (Ext. P-11). There is no evidence to suggest that the form seized from Neha was filled in by the deceased Megha; nor was the latter's signature identified or proved. 47. The counsel stressed that the independent witnesses who deposed to such a form do not indicate that there were any signatures on it. PW 3 merely stated that a paper/document (of \"Oriflame\") was recovered from Neha's residence. He did not indicate whether the form was filled. PW 6 stated that certain articles including the form were seized in his presence but did not indicate their nature/details. While PW 3 identified the form in court, no question for the purpose of identifying the handwriting on such form was put to him .

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 399 police personnel at the time of such seizure were not found on the pullanda containing the form. The only witness providing any details with reference to the \"Oriflame\" form is PW 31 10. It was urged that these \"details\" too were mere surmises of PW 31 untested during the investigation or trial. 48. It was also pointed out that all questions put to Neha, relating to the recovery of the Oriflame form, were denied. While PW 1, in his examination- in-chief states that his wife was a consultant at Oriflame, the form seized from Neha's house was not shown to him. Evidence in this regard may have been forthcoming from him. In fact, neither PW 1, nor any Oriflame employee admitted the handwriting of Megha. The prosecution did not conduct any forensic examination of the form to establish the alleged handwriting/signature of Megha. Further, PW 1 was also involved in a TIP for the seizures of articles seized, where certain jewellery, allegedly belonging to the deceased, was purportedly identified by him. Inexplicably the \"Oriflame\" form was not put to him by the prosecution in these proceedings. Therefore, it is evident that the \"Oriflame\" document does not connect the deceased, Megha, or her relation of dealing with Neha as there was no investigation on this document. Therefore, barring the ipse dixit of PW 31 10, there is nothing suggesting that the \"Oriflame\" form was filled for Megha, or filled or signed by her. 49. Mr Shri Singh next urged that DW 1 Deepika Shinde had admitted to going to the spot on 19-6-2011, based on a request made by the Control Room. She also sought information from the officials at PS MIG, and thereafter spoke to the deceased persons' neighbours. However, DW 1 could not provide any details in this regard during her examination-in-chief. Though DW 1 stated that she examined the CDRs of the accused persons, she provided no specific details of such analysis in her testimony. DW 1 also admitted interrogating Neha. DW 1 further confirmed that she was informed by a source that N eha would leave her house wearing a pair of jeans and a maroon top. This information was received by DW 1 prior to Neha's arrest, and therefore presumably DW 1, by her own admission, was involved in the investigation even beyond 22-6-2011. Further, DW 1 stated that she shared the source information with her colleagues and subordinates. PW 28, while giving patently false testimony in court also stated that when he saw Neha at LIG Tiraha, she was dressed in \"black jeans and a maroon top\". PW 28's deposition shows how he allegedly spotted Neha, which is belied by DW l 's testimony. Despite such a deposition, the prosecution elected not to cross-examine DW 1. 50. It was argued that DW 1 Deepika Shinde's presence during the investigation was confirmed by PW 7's testimony. He is alleged to be an independent witness to the recoveries from Neha's residence on 22-6-2011. At Para 14 of his testimony and during cross-examination, he admitted that DW 1 was a part of the raiding team - a fact that has been kept out of the record. The counsel submitted that all these facts can be simply answered by Neha's illegal custody before 22-6-2011. It was strongly urged that Neha's personal search and the recoveries from her residence were tainted and the records and seizures pertaining to these purported proceedings could not be relied upon.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 400 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec events taking place on 22-6-2011 indicated that the police fabricated the record, resulting in Neha's false implication. 51. Mr Singh next argued that the prosecution did not prove any prior relationship between the accused. Neither was any material produced to suggest that the three accused knew each other or had any prior plan, agreement or common intention to commit a robbery at the place of incident. The prosecution admittedly had access to the CDRs of the accused persons and could have demonstrated the fact whether there was a relationship, which there was none. Either way the CDR evidence was crucial to the prosecution and the lack of explanation as to why it was not a part of the investigation casts doubts on the investigation and its fairness. It was stated that while the official investigation claimed that no CDRs were accessed (PW 31 's statement is relied on for this), the unofficial investigation (or, that material kept away from court) conducted by DW 1 admitted having access to and analysing the CD Rs. This aspect lends credence to the defence that the present investigation was improper and that it would be unsafe to rely upon it to render findings of the accused's guilt. Reliance is placed on Suresh Sakharam Nangare v. State of Maharashtra 17 in this regard. 52. It was further argued that while convicting Neha under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC, the courts below failed to appreciate that there is no material to suggest that she had any common intention with the co-accused persons, much less a common intention to commit murder. Further, the nature of Neha's conviction highlights that no weapon was recovered from her; she did not suffer any injury and none of her personal items of belonging were recovered from the crime scene. 53. Supplementing Ms Prakash's arguments regarding PW 10, it was argued that the testimony of this chance witness was unreliable due to gaps and contradictions. PW l0's cross-examination revealed that his examination- in-chief was an improvement over his statement under Section 161 CrPC - the witness had embellished his version of the incident, such as the fact of the injury of the accused persons, and more pertinently, Neha's statement having arrived on her Scooty and telling one of the boys to take the other injured boy to the hospital. PW 10 also contradicted himself regarding what brought him to the police station and regarding the TIP. In his examination-in-chief, he stated that a woman constable was present at the TIP, whereas during cross- ex amination, the witne ss state d that no woman constable was present at such proceedings. Further, while PW 12 the Tahsildar, PW 18 Pratap Kumar Agasia, and PW 11 Raju Sen, stated that both PW 10 and PW 11 appeared for the TIP together, PW 10 did not mention the presence of PW 11 on such day. It was furthermore, urged that PW l0's credibility was que stionable as h e appeared to be a stock witness - he deposed during his cross-examination that he had previously appeared as a witness for the prosecution in another case registered at PS Palasia. 17 (2012) 9 sec 249. para 21 : (2012) 3 sec (Cri) 1078 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 401 54. Mr Singh urged that the prosecution did not give any explanation about the delay in conducting the TIP proceedings, given that PW 10 had informed about him sighting three persons on 20-6-2011, barely a day after the incident; whereas the TIP was conducted much later on 14-7-2011, by which date the photographs of the accused had been published in newspapers. Reliance was placed on the judgments of this Court which observed that a delay in a TIP must be explained to place reliance on the testimony of a witness. Reference is made to this Court's judgments in State of A.P. v. M. V. Ramana Reddy 18 and Rajesh Govind Jagesha v. State of Maharashtra 19. It was submitted that apart from being delayed, and procedurally questionable, the TIP conducted on 14-7-2011 did not yield any information that was not already part of the public domain. The counsel relied on M atru v. State of U.P. 20 where this Court observed that identification tests are not substantive evidence and may only be used for the purpose of helping the investigating agency with the progress of the investigation. 55. It was argued that the shoeprint report (Ext. P-125) contains contradictory statements, making it unreliable. Further, it did not provide any conclusive material regarding the shoeprints found at the scene of crime and were found to be negative for matches. It was pointed out that for shoeprints obtained by the police, no moulds were made from the available physical prints at the site and instead colour photos of the footprints were obtained. The camera used for taking such photos did not have the time/date, though such features were available. During analysis of colour photos, the photographs were found insufficient to reach any conclusion regarding the footprints in Ext. P-118. It was argued that no individual shoe characteristics were found from the prints. The print or design of the soles were missing in the photoprints, and it could not be ascertained if the sole print of the sandal at H3 matched with any print found at the scene of crime. However, inexplicably the report concludes that ES and E9 are photos identical to H3. The shoeprint said to have been obtained from Neha does not specify whether it is of the right or the left foot. It was submitted that this Court in Pritam Singh v. State of Punjab 21 and Balbir Singh v. State of Punjab 22 found that footprints are a weak and rudimentary evidence. The counsel urged that the evidence led by the prosecution itself is weak and admits that there was insufficient material to conduct the comparison, yet the comparison was carried out as in terms of Ext. P-125, the examination report, SFSL, Sagar. Further, the seizures relating to the shoeprints were only sent to FSL, Sagar on 13-7-2011-as seen from Ext. P-115-after an unexplained delay. 56. Mr Singh next argued that the fingerprint report relating to chance prints was not reliable, and at best can only be used as corroborative evidence.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 402 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec were from an open place, accessible to the public, between the period when the door had been opened by PW 5 till the arrival of the investigating agency. While collecting chance fingerprints, no fingerprints of the persons present/ neighbours, or other members of the household, were taken in order to eliminate such prints. PW 3, PW 5, and PW 24 were cross-examined on this account. They deposed that the fingerprints of others to whom the place was accessible, were not taken. 57. With regard to the report (Ext. P-84) prepared by the fingerprint expert, PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi while conducting the analysis of the fingerprints, some concerns were pointed out. Firstly, failure to describe the method/procedure for lifting of the prints; secondly failure to obtain elimination prints of other persons, for which no explanation has been provided by the police; thirdly, that the expert was unable to provide an explanation about the fact that none of the fingerprints analysed matched those of any of the deceased persons; and fourthly, the expert did not explain why the process under the Madhya Pradesh Police Rules regarding dissection of fingerprint of corpses i.e. Rule 824, was not followed while obtaining the prints of the deceased persons. It was further urged that the expert did not provide a robust process for analysis. The analysis described by fingerprint expert PW 24 claims to rely on an 8-point method. The method followed by PW 24 merely describes Level I of the ACEY Method (Analysis, Comparison, Evaluation and Verification Method), used by the investigating agencies across jurisdictions. Levels 2 and 3 of the ACE- Y method were not followed. The 8-point matching system, followed for the analysis, was argued to be insufficient and not in compliance with such method. The counsel relied on Hari Om v. State of U.P. 23 to argue that the question of confirmation bias in this regard cannot be ruled out, given that the prints of the accused were not anonymised while providing such information to the expert analysing the fingerprints. 58. The counsel for the appellants urged that in the present case, crucial circumstances, such as Neha's arrest (which constituted the breakthrough in the investigation), the narration and deposition of the chance witness PW 10, and the inconsistencies relating to the recoveries, as well as the expert reports, lead to grave doubts. It was submitted that in cases based on circumstantial evidence, the five \"golden principles\" enunciated by this Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra 24 have to be fully established and that the Court should be convinced that the accused \"must be\" guilty and not \"may be\" guilty. Further, the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty. The circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency. The circumstances should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved, and there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion 23 (2021) 4 sec 345, paras 25, 38-41, 43: (2021) 2 sec (Cri) 440 24 (1984) 4 sec 116: 1984 sec (Cri) 487 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(Ravindra Bhat, J.) 403 consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused. a 59. It was submitted that the complete \"blackout\" of the role of DW 1, in the face of her admission to being involved with the investigation, her receiving an out-of-turn promotion for solving the case, her deposition that she had analysed the CDRs which were never produced, or relied on, and her involvement before Neha's arrest, as well as her involvement during the arrest and subsequent questioning, all pointed to grave doubts about the b circumstance s which actually led to Neha's arrest. It was strongly urged that this cast a doubt on her entire role. Likewise, the piecemeal recoveries effected on two different dates, at the behest of the three accused, the improbability of the accused retaining incriminating articles like weapons, even while allegedly getting rid of clothes, shoes, and vehicles, etc. cast doubts and suspicions about the genuineness of recovery of the articles. It was argued that all this, coupled c with the untrustworthiness of the chance witness PW 10-his contradictions in deposition, admission to being a stock police witness, and who by his admission saw the accused for a very brief while, as w ell as the inexplicable delay in holding TIP-together undermine the prosecution story about identification of the accused, and their alleged role in the crime. d e f g h Submissions of the State 60. Ms Swarupama Chaturvedi, learned Additional Advocate General (AAG) for the State of Madhya Pradesh, argued that this Court should not disturb the concurrent findings of the appellant's guilt recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, and confirmed by the High Court in its impugned judgment 3 • She submitted that though the case is based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution was successful in proving beyond reasonable doubt, every circumstance, and also in conclusively establishing the guilt of the accused/appellants, on a cumulative reading of all circumstances. She emphasised that the conclusive nature of the evidence is such that any hypothesis of the appellants' innocence is ruled out and that the only conclusion that can be reached is that they and none others, are guilty of the crime of triple murder, which they were charged with. 61. Heavy reliance was placed on the findings in the ballistic report, wherein each circumstance was proved by the expert evidence. In this regard, the counsel relied on Ext. P-25, the map of the crime spot prepared by PW 31 10 which found two fired cartridges (at Point 7) and one live bullet (at Point 6). The bullets were seized and recorded at Ext. P-27, the seizure memo. The post-mortem report Ext. P-44 indicated and forwarded a bullet, recovered from Megha' s body. The recovery of this bullet was also deposed to by PW 15 Dr P.S. Thakur. The bullet was seized under memo Ext. P-127. Likewise, PW 32 had extracted a bullet from Rahul's foot, in the early hours of 20-6-2011 at M.Y. Hospital. The bullet was deposited under memo Ext. P-113, in the hospital's medico-legal cell. It was later seized under memo Ext. P-108 on 23-6-2011. The seizure of a knife and pistol from Rahul's possession was recorded at Ext. P-14. 3 Manoj v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 404 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec This pistol was examined and test fired: a report, Ext. P-120 was given by the ballistic expert, confirming that the spent bullets (the cartridges of which were seized from the crime scene), the live bullet (also seized from the crime scene), the bullet extracted from Rahul's foot, and the bullet extracted from Megha's body, were all fired from the same pistol, which was recovered and seized at the behest ofRahul (Ext. P-14). The counsel also relied on Ext. P-52 the report of the armourer. It was argued further that the seizure, sealing and proper custody of these articles was spoken to by PW 3, PW 5 and PW 19, besides PW 3110. There is neither any contradiction nor any gap in their testimonies; further the ballistic report fully supports the prosecution version that the bullets recovered were fired from the weapon seized at the behest of Rahul, from his house. 62. The AAG argued that the ballistic report as well as medical opinion establish the fact that except one injury on deceased Megha's forehead, all injuries which caused death of all three deceased were due to the two knives recovered at the instance of accused Rahul and Manoj. The learned counsel relied on the testimony of PW 15, the doctor who conducted the post-mortems on the deceased, as well as his report (Ext. P-44). It was argued that from the crime scene till report and thereafter, seals were maintained and the chain of custody of articles was constantly intact, without any break. Seizure witnesses supported these facts in their statements. 63. Regarding the shoeprints, the counsel for the State relied on Exts. P-31 and P-32 (regarding seizure of shoes at the behest of Manoj); Exts. P-34 and P-35 (regarding seizure of shoe at the behest of Neha); Ext. P-21 (seizure on 22-6-2011); Ext. P-77 (inspection report of the crime scene by PW 21 Senior Scientific Officer); Ext. P-115 (forwarding of these samples for testing); Ext. P-75 seizure memo of a shoe recorded by PS Annapurna on 23-6-2011; deposition of PW 20, who witnessed seizure of shoe; shoeprint report (Ext. P-125); and the deposition of PW 3110. It was submitted that these witnesses did not contradict themselves, and the prosecution had fully and satisfactorily established the presence of the shoeprint reports, as well as their matching, from the prints obtained from the crime scene. These proved that the accused and no other were present in the premises, when the crime was committed. 64. The AAG argued that the main motive behind the murders was robbery. This was established by the recovery of the stolen articles pursuant to the disclosure statements proved by Ext. P-10 and Ext. P-11 which were seized after Neha's disclosure statement; the seizure of articles pursuant to statement of Rahul (Ext. P-13 and Ext. P-14); and recovery pursuant to statement of Manoj (Exts. P-16 and P-17). During the TIP of the articles, PW 1 Niranjan Deshpande identified the looted articles (such as jewellery items) as those belonging to the deceased, which was also corroborated by the testimony of PW 12, the Tahsildar. Furthermore, PW 4 Banno Solanki also supported the seizure of the ATM card from Neha, when she was detained and later, arrested on 22-6-2011. PW 27, a bank officer, deposed that the ATM card (Ex t. P-98) recovered pursuant to Neha's disclosure statement, was issued by his bank.

The disclosure and recovery of the looted articles, as well as their recoveries and later identification, from the premises of the accused, disclosed their direct link with the murders, and established that they were the perpetrators. 65. It was submitted that the appellants have sought to discredit the prosecution by alleging that Neha was arrested earlier, and for that purpose, exaggerated the role played by DW 1 Deepika Shinde. The appellants sought to insinuate that that officer played a prominent role in the investigation, and was taken off it, and that her role in solving the crime, earned her an out-of- turn promotion. The AAG urged that the appellants relied upon the statement of DW 1 Deepika Shinde, who had never claimed that she had made any arrest in the present case. As an officer of the Crime Branch she was involved initially in assisting or helping ascertain the basic details, as the victims were women. DW 1 was posted with a unit called \"We care for you\", which focusses upon women's protection. Soon after Neha's arrest, the 10 felt that DW 1 was not needed to do anything further. Her promotion was based upon her contribution and role in many cases and this being just one for her initial response cannot be considered that significant. It was submitted that her hidden role, alleged by the appellants, is a bogey. While she admitted to analysing call details, it is forthcoming from the trial proceedings, that the call details had no role - much less any significance, in the investigation, or pinning the accused, their arrest, or recovery of articles at their behest. Therefore, the theory of the appellants' counsel that Neha was not actually arrested as projected by the prosecution, or as found, is without any basis, but merely argumentative. 66. The AAG submitted that chance witness PW 10 witnessed the immediate aftermath of the crime, as he saw the three accused leaving after committing the crime. He described, at the earliest opportunity- on 20-6-2011, that two boys (one injured at the ankle, and the other at the elbow, and both bleeding as a result of the injuries) were sitting on a bike, when a girl in a Scooty appeared, and asked them to go to a doctor for examination. The so-called discrepancies highlighted by the appellants, are neither material, nor of such importance to discredit the entire version given by him, in the course of his deposition in court. It was urged that nothing worthwhile was elicited in PW l0's cross-examination. He clearly identified the three individuals, at the earliest opportunity i.e. after knowing about the occurrence of the crime and also unhesitatingly identified them in court, in the presence of PW 18, the Naib Tahsildar. The latter witness corroborated the testimony of PW 10 as regards identification. 67. The 10 also proved seizure of Suzuki service book and clothes, at Neha's behest on 23-6-2011 which linked with the recovery of the Scooty (again, at her behest) later on that day, from a place where it had been hidden. The seizures were also corroborated by the testimony of PW 7, who further identified the articles (Exts. Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3) in court. 68. Ms Chaturvedi submitted that the fingerprint expert's evidence unerringly pointed to all appellants' complicity and guilt.

P-81 , Ext. P-82 and Ext. P-83) were lifted on 20-6-2011, by Constable Dinesh . The fingerprints of the three accused/ a appellants were obtained on 24-6-2011 (Ext. P-41, Ext. P-42 and Ext. P-43) by PW 13 Constable Vijay Singh. His deposition was sought to be discredited by the appellants, by pointing out that while the fingerprint samples were obtained, according to him, the accused had signed on the forms (but which were not actually found); and further, that the forms did not contain the photographs of the accused. The learned AAG pointed out that the form used, is the one as b required in the Madhya Pradesh Police Manual, and there is no requirement of a witness, at the time of obtaining fingerprint samples. Furthermore, the cross-examination of this witness was not worthwhile as nothing significant was elicited from them. 69. The AAG emphasised that the report of the fingerprint expert (Ext. P-84) dated 11-7-2011 by PW 24 K.K. Trivedi, fully supported the prosecution. c It established that four fingerprints could be developed and compared with chance fingerprints found at the crime scene . The report clearly stated that two fingerprints lifted from the site (A and B) matched with the sample fingerprint of Rahul; fingerprint D matched with the fingerprint of Manoj and fingerprint E matched with the fingerprint of Neha. PW 17 Satyanarayan Patel had photographed the crime scene, including the spots where prints were collected, d which corroborated beyond any doubt, that the appellants were present at the crime scene. 70. It was argued that a crucial circumstance that has to be considered is that appellants Rahul alias Govind and Manoj were also injured. PW 30 R.S. Makwana, ASI who was posted at Annapurna PS stated that Appellant 2 Rahul alias Govind' s leg was wounded. This was also informed to TI Gaurishankar Chadar, who wrote dehati nalisi (Ext. P-103); Crime No. 377/11 under Sections 294, 307, 34 IPC was registered. PW 26 Mukesh Bhachawat deposed that on 19-6-2011 Constable Dinesh of Annapurana PS brought accused Rahul; he found an injury on his right toe, which had a charring firearm wound. The statement of the 10 was that on the basis of information received from Rahul, a shoe (size 44) for the left leg was recovered in the presence of witnesses from the nearby RTO Office. Both the shoe s which were seized were brown-coloured with three holes and seized within the jurisdiction of PS Annapurna. One shoe had a gunshot mark and the other shoe belonged to Rahul. From the statement of the medical officer, the right toe of right leg ofRahul alias Govind had a gunshot injury and the recovered right shoe had a gunshot hole. Rahul's medical report supported the fact that he had sustained one gunshot injury on the toe of his right leg. 71. It is argued that the DNA reports established that the bloodstains found on shoes and clothes of the accused, matched the body fluid of the deceased. The DNA repor t, coupled with depo sition of PW 35 e stablished that body fluid of deceased Megha was found on Rahul's articles (Exts. F-4, F-5); body fluid of deceased Ashlesha was found on Manoj's articles (Exts. G-1, G-3); and Neha's sandal (Ext. H-2) had traces of deceased Megha's body fluids. e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 407 72. The learned counsel argued that the facts of the case were proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt to indicate that the accused and none a else, were the three persons who had committed the crime for which both courts below had convicted them. It was argued that no prosecution can prove facts perfectly and that some lapses or inconsistencies are bound to occur, given the tricks memories play because of which witnesses may not recollect events perfectly or in chronological order. To make her point, the AAG relied on the observations cited by this Court in Iqbal Moosa Patel v. State of Gujarat25 . b 73. It was lastly argued that the appellants offered no explanation when the incriminating circumstances were put to them, under Section 313 CrPC. It was stressed that this Court in many decisions has in fact held that examination of accused under Section 313 CrPC manifests the principles of natural justice - audi alteram partem, by curtailing all interferences at that stage from the counsel, prosecutors, witnesses, third parties, etc. The accused may be asked to c furnish some explanation as regards the incriminating circumstances associated with him, and the court must take note of such explanation. Therefore, by essentially establishing a dialogue between the accused and the trial court, the examination of the accused under Section 313 CrPC is not a mere formality and the answers given by the accused have a practical utility. It was submitted that the complete lack of any explanation, much less a reasonable explanation, only d meant that the accused could not justify their conduct; they had no argument to offer. e f g h 74. In view of these submissions, the AAG concluded that this Court should not interfere , under its special le ave appellate jurisdiction with the concurrent findings of guilt, recorded by the courts below, based on a full and fair appreciation of all the evidence and material on the record. Analysis and findings I. Neha's arrest 75. PW 28 (Vijay Singh Chauhan) deposed that he saw Neha loitering suspiciously at 6.00 a.m. on 23-6-2011, near an ATM. He relayed this to PS MIG, where the information was received by PW 19 Gaikwad. The 10 (PW 31 ), formed a team consisting of PW 13 (Vijay Singh), PW 36 (Mula yam Singh), Constable Devendra and PW 4 (Banno Solanki, the woman constable). This party went to the site, and confronted Neha; her body search was conducted by PW 4 which yielded Ashlesha' s ATM card. The search memo (in which time recorded is 6.40 a.m.) was produced as Ext. P-22. Neha was taken in for questioning and later arrested. 76. PW 28' s testimony i s supported by PW 4, PW 31 and PW 36. However, deposition of PW 19 (Y.R. Gaikwad) is silent about the reporting of Neha's suspicious activity - and what was deposed by PW 28, as corroborated by others. Constable Devendra was not examined. This omission is per se, insignificant because while proving certain facts and events if by and large, witne sses are consistent, any omission can be overlooked. 25 (2011) 2 sec 198, para 22: (2011) 1 sec (Cri) 654 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 408 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec 77. Nevertheless, a few aspects urged by the appellants with respect to the events proximate to, and surrounding Neha's arrest bear scrutiny. DW 1 Deepika Shinde (who was promoted as Inspector when she deposed) - admitted to analysing call detail records and importantly, to receiving information-from an undisclosed \"source\"-that Neha would be at the spot- from where she was ultimately arrested on 22-6-2011, and that she would be in jeans and a maroon-coloured top. DW 1 deposed that she had received this tip off prior to Neha's arrest i.e. before 6.30 a.m., and she shared this information with the police. PW 28, however, denied the involvement of DW 1. During the trial, the defence had relied on certain documents - notably Ext. D-32 and Ext. D-46, to say that DW 1 received an out-of-turn promotion for her role in solving the crime. That out-of-turn promotion was given to DW 1 and PW 28, was admitted by both of them. It is evident, therefore, that DW 1 received prior information regarding Neha's likely whereabouts and further details even to the extent of a description of her attire. The prosecution's studied silence with respect to her role is not just mystifying but is a matter of concern. 78. The prosecution sought to establish through the testimonies of the 10 as well as PW 3 (Deepak Ranade) and PW 6 (Triyambak alias Prafulla), that Neha was taken to the police station and questioned. They then proceeded to Neha's house. As per the IO's testimony, the raiding party included PW 19 and PW 4. The further prosecution case in the statements of PW 31, PW 3 and PW 6 was that Neha was interrogated on the way to her house and later arrested, after which her disclosure statement was recorded leading to the recovery of the stolen articles at her behest. At this instance also there was not even a slight whisper by any prosecution witness about DW 1 Deepika Shinde's role. 79. During her deposition, DW 1 affirmed that she had gone to the crime scene on 19-6-2011 itself. She also admitted that: \"I had analysed call records in the instant case. Today, I cannot tell as to which call and as to how it was analysed by me. I had not investigated the instant matter. I recall that I had interrogated one accused in this matter later. I might have interrogated lady accused (Neha Verma) present in the court is the same person whom I had interrogated.\" 80. Later, DW 1 was unable to state the precise time in terms of number of hours after the incident when she had interrogated Neha. However, she was clear that she did so after Neha's arrest by PS MIG. She further clarified that she had \"interrogated Neha Verma in MIG Police Station itself'. PW 7 Sandeep Narulkar who concededly joined the investigation as a panch witness on 23-6-2011, admitted in the cross-examination that DW 1 \"Police Sub- Inspector was not with us, she was in other vehicle\". This witness was cross- examined on 2-3-2012 but he failed to identify her on that day. He, however, admitted that he could not remember how many lady officers were present during the investigation on 23-6-2011 i.e. the day on which he was asked to present as a witness. 81.

Similarly, in reply to an RTI query by DW 6 Anil Verma (Neha's father), the PIO, Police Headquarters at Bhopal sent a response (dated 22-5-2012), No. PH/1 0/Record/RTI/70/12/506/12. The material part of this document, produced as Ext. D-46, is extracted below: \"Subject: Information under Section 6(1 ), Right to Information Act, 2005. Reference: Your application dated 29-2-2012, 16-3-2012, 23-3-2012 and 26-3-2012. Kindly peruse abovereferred applications information received sought on two points by you, is as under: 1.

The admissions by DW 1 on three aspects i.e. (a) analysing call details in respect of certain mobile numbers; (b) obtaining source information from an informer which was passed on to MIG Police Station; (c) interrogation ofNeha after her arrest, in MIG Police Station, thus stand proved. PW 7's deposition also suggests that DW 1 was with the investigation team even on 23-6-2011 and hence, provides independent corroboration in supporting the appellants' arguments in this regard. 84. DW l 's role in the pre-arrest, intelligence information gathering, the arrest, interrogation of Neha, which the prosecution tried to studiously keep away from the court thus, leads one to conclude that its version with respect to apprehension and arrest of Neha are not believable. It is also a matter of record that DW 3, the then Inspector General of Police Sanjay Rana admitted that the Police Department had issued Ext. D-32 on 4-10-2011 containing a list including at Sl. No. 26-an unnamed informant-of persons given awards for their contribution. In the present case, all these materials i.e. evidence of DW 1 and DW 7 as well as the documents issued by the Police Department/State Government itself, clearly point towards the involvement of DW 1, not merely at a peripheral stage, but on a pervasive basis, even after, in regard to the enquiry in the immediate aftermath of the crime, gathering intelligence information with respect to the probable accused; analysing call details, participating in the arrest, interrogation of the accused and even an involvement with further investigating steps leading to recovery of articles. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 412 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec 85. DW 6 Anil Verma (Neha's father) in his statement had deposed that Neha was taken away for questioning much earlier, on 19-6-2011 itself. He deposed that on 21-6-2011 one Kishan Panwar from Crime Branch went to him and said that Neha was using a stolen mobile phone for which an inquiry was being conducted. At his behest, DW 6 asked Neha to reach home immediately. Once she reached, DW 6 contacted Kishan Panwar and informed him about her return from the office. He reached DW 6's house 15-20 minutes later with DW 1. They checked Neha's mobile phone and then left the place stating that N eha would be taken for about an hour and a half for inquiry. DW 1 did not disclose where she would be taken but allowed the witness DW 6 to accompany them at a distance. According to DW 6, Neha was taken to SP's Office at Regal Crossing and taken upstairs. The witness was not allowed to go there, and instead was asked to leave, at which point he went home along with his son. He stated further that on 23-6-2011 at 7.30 a.m. or so he was asked telephonically to keep Neha's clothes outside, as the police was coming to collect them. The police reached DW 6's house in the evening at which point they took a maroon top and one pair of jeans. The witness was cross-examined by the prosecution to suggest that his deposition was false; he denied it. 86. What is evident from an overall reading of the prosecution version as compared to the testimonies of DW 1, DW 3 and DW 4 as well as the documentary evidence is that the \"breakthrough\", claimed by the prosecution resulting from Neha's arrest on 22-6-2011 is not correct. The police had knowledge about the sim cards of deceased Aslesha and Megha. Apparently, the call details of these were analysed by DW 1. However, the prosecution kept these details away from the trial. Likewise, although PW 28 and PW 31 both elaborately described how Neha was arrested (especially role played by PW 4, PW 19 who relayed the information and the participation of PW 3, PW 6 as well as PW 36), all of them were conspicuously silent about DW 1. Whereas DW 1 admitted, in no uncertain terms, at two different places, to having participated in the interrogation of Neha and also having given information regarding her likely whereabouts-including the clothes that she would wear, leading to her arrest. The cat was out of the bag, so to say when PW 7 admitted that DW 1 participated in the recovery of articles on 23-6-2011, a day after the arrest of all the appellants. 87. Having regard to all these circumstances, the prosecution version with respect to Neha's arrest and interrogation cannot be believed. The suppression of these facts, from the court, attracts an adverse inference that the prosecution's version with respect to manner of Neha's arrest, and the role of DW 1, is unreliable. 88. The question which then arises is: What is the impact of the rejection of the manner of Neha's arrest on the prosecution's case? The appellant urged that, the entire story - i.e. disclosure statements and the recoveries effected on 22-6-2011 and 23-6-2011, has to be rejected. This Court is of the opinion that such a drastic approach is uncalled for. Concededly, the present case is entirely based on circumstantial evidence. The rejection of the prosecution version with respect to Neha's arrest would mean that only that circumstance is held not to be a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In some ways, it is an entry point; its rejection would mean that the Court should proceed cautiously with other evidence, objectively determine whether all other circumstances were proved beyond reasonable doubt, and whether in the end the guilt of the accused and not others, has been so proved. II. Circumstances relating to arrest of the other appellants 89. If the circumstances leading to Neha's arrest on 22-6-2011 be disbelieved, what remains as a matter of the record is that she was interrogated in the presence of PW 3 and PW 6 that day. It is necessary to analyse the depositions of these witnesses. PW 3 is a relative of the deceased, as well as Niranjan Deshpande (PW 1). He was present on 19-6-2011 and witnessed the seizure and sealing of blood samples, fingerprints and the articles found at the crime scene. He was also a witness to the inquest proceedings. He deposed that the 10 (PW 31) asked him, in the morning of 22-6-2011 to reach the police station, with some other person. PW 31, however, did not support PW 3 about asking him to bring another person. Nevertheless, PW 3 and PW 6 reached the police station at around 7.30 a.m. Neha's arrest is shown at 8.10 a.m.; the disclosure statement and recovery of two golden bangles, a broken mangalsutra, 3 guriyas, gold pendant, an ATM card belonging to deceased Megha, an 0riflame perfume bottle and an 0riflame form (apparently with Megha's signature) were witnessed by PW 3. He also deposed with respect to the arrest of Rahul (at 9.00 a.m.), disclosure statement by him and recovery of various articles i.e. a pistol, a knife, two golden bangles, part of a broken mangalsutra containing a \"guriya\" and chain (weighing approximately 9 grams), a black guriya, and Rahul's photograph (wearing a black-beaded bracelet on his right hand). He further testified to the arrest of Manoj at 10.05 a.m., on 22-6-2011, his disclosure and pointing to articles, leading to their recovery (Ext. P-16 & Ext. P-17). The recovered articles included two golden bangles, portion of a broken mangalsutra, a knife and a photograph with Manoj in sunglasses. PW 6 corroborated those facts. 90. PW 3' s testimony was impeached pointing to the discrepancy in time. He reached the police station after 7. 30 a.m. Further, in cross-examination, the witness was not able to depose about particulars of the houses the police party went to, who were there, etc. Likewise, a question mark was raised about PW 6. It was urged that the 10 never asked another witness to accompany PW 3. It was urged that these witnesses are interested persons, as they are related to the deceased and PW 1. Another argument regarding the recoveries on 22-6-2011 was that it is unbelievable that Rahul and Manoj would have kept the looted articles and the weapons used to assault and kill the deceased, given that they tried to dispose off other articles such as shoes, camera, clothes, etc. and hide the bike and Scooty, etc. In the opinion of the Court, the manner of arrest of these individuals, has been spoken to by and large consistently by the two witnesses PW 3 and PW 6 who have corroborated the I0's deposition. However, in respect of Neha, what is not explained is why PW 4 (Banno Solanki) did not participate in her arrest and search of her ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 414 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec premises. After having called PW 4, to ensure compliance with the law that a woman police constable should apprehend, search and arrest a female accused, the prosecution has offered no explanation as to why PW 4 was not involved in the further proceedings. PW 4 admitted that she was sitting in the car when the team proceeded to Neha's house. Her presence in the team is confirmed by PW 3 as well as the 10. PW 4 herself does not corroborate the prosecution version about recoveries made from N eha' s house. 91. As observed earlier, the seizure memos detailing the articles seized at the behest of the accused: Ext. P-11 (Neha) included an ATM card which belonged to Megha, the deceased; Ext. P-14 (Rahul) included looted jewellery (golden bangles, part of broken mangalsutra), a country-made pistol, a knife measuring 35.5 cm, and a photograph of him wearing a black diamond-like beaded bracelet on his right hand; Ext. P-17 (Manoj) included looted jewellery (two gold bangles, part of a broken mangalsutra), an iron knife of overall length of 34.5 cm and a photograph of him wearing brown-coloured sunglasses. As per the prosecution, these articles are related to their crime. 92. PW 3 and PW 6, both depose that after the seizure of the article each of them remained with the police till 5.00 p.m. on 22-6-2011. The prosecution version is that the arrest of all three accused persons were completed by 10.05 a.m., their disclosure statements recorded, and all the articles seized by 10.35 a.m. (as per Ext. P-17). There is no explanation as to why further investigation was not taken up. All that seems to have occurred on 22-6-2011 thereafter i.e. after 10.35 a.m., was the nails of the accused were cut and seizure memos prepared (as deposed to by PW 3 and PW 6). The seizure memos in this regard are Exts. P-18, P-19 and P-20. These were drawn in the e arly afternoon: Ext. P-18 (13:05 hrs); Ext. P-19 (13:15 hrs) and Ext. P-20 (13:25 hrs). The prosecution alleged that later at Rahul' s behest the left shoe worn by him during the incident was seized at 16:40 hrs from an open area near his house (Ext. P-21). 93. The prosecution did not explain why there were breaks in the investigation, given that the disclosure statements of all accused, and consequent recoveries took place in the morning of 22-6-2011. It is also a matter of record that though the accused were arrested that day they were only produced before the Magistrate on the next day. In other words, there was no impediment for the police to have proceeded further or taken immediate steps to secure all evidence. This aspect is, in this Court's opinion, important because even if the manner in which Neha was arrested was to be discounted (as discussed earlier) the fact that they were arrested in the presence of PW 3 and PW 6, further proceedings and investigative steps including the seizure of articles at the behest of the accused and pursuant to their statements, stand proved. These are reasons why the events of 22-6-2011 (after the arrest of the accused, and recoveries were made at their behest) have to be segregated and seen differently from the events and circumstances relied upon by the prosecution on other dates. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 415 94. The credibility of PW 3 and PW 6, in this Court's opinion, cannot be doubted. PW 3 was present on 19-6-2011, after discovery of the murderous attack and PW 1 Niranjan Deshpande stayed with him after reaching lndore. He (PW 3) was the deceased Rohini's nephew and even performed the funeral rites of the deceased. Likewise, PW 6 lived in Village Barlai which is about 45 minutes by bus, from Jaora (where PW 3 resided). He knew PW 3 and had known Rohini for about 10-15 years. He reached PW 3's house when the latter asked him to accompany him to the police station, since Neha had been caught and her search had yielded an ATM card which belonged to Ashlesha. Of these two witnesses, PW 3 is related to the deceased; however, PW 6 was not. Both witnesses corroborated each other's testimony and prove the prosecution story about Neha's questioning, her arrest, disclosure statement, recoveries made pursuant to her statement, as well as the arrest, disclosure statements and recoveries made from Rahul and Manoj. Furthermore, there is no discrepancy between their testimonies and that of the 10 (PW 31 ). Another piece of evidence is that PW 27, an officer of Bank of India, Ujjain deposed that he issued a letter (Ext. P-98) to the SHO containing the ATM card numbers. Megha's ATM card, recovered pursuant to N eha' s disclosure statement, was issued by his bank; this was among the articles seized on 22-6-2011. 95. An overall analysis of the testimonies of PW 3 and PW 6 shows that despite some inconsistencies, which can be put down to imperfect or faulty recollection of sequence of events, or about the people present, etc. their testimonies are credible. The effect of their depositions is that they witnessed the disclosure statements of Neha, Rahul and Manoj, and also witnessed the recovery of articles and their seizure by the police , which were recorded in seizure memos (Exts. P-11, P-14 and P-17). III. Recoveries of 23-6-2011 96. PW 7 Sandeep Narulkar is an independent witness, who testified to the disclosure statements of the accused Rahul and Manoj on 23-6-2011 and the recoveries made pursuant to it. He deposed to witnessing Rahul telling the police about the incident of 19-6-2011 and that in that incident, a camera and two mobile sets were looted. Rahul gave information about the camera, motorcycle, clothes worn, and knife used at the time of incident; he said that he could get the articles recovered. Then police prepared a disclosure memo (Ext. P-28) witnessed and signed by PW 7. He said that on Rahul's direction, the police recovered the motorcycle in question from bene ath a small bridge over Pithampur Road, one dark brown-coloured trouser, a full sleeved grey- coloured shirt, and a bloodstained iron knife with metal handle (Ext. P-29). Further, the police also seized a lens of a broken camera (Ext. P-30). Both seizure memos (Exts. P-29, P-30) contained PW 7's signature. When shown in court, he also identified the articles (brown-coloured full pants, knife, one lens of broken camera). He further stated that police interrogated Manoj before him and Manoj gave information about robbery and murder, and about the clothes and shoes worn at the time of incident and told that he could get them recovered. The police then prepared memorandum Ext. P-31 containing the witnesse s' ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 416 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec signature. As per Manoj 's direction, the police seized a ''firoji\" -coloured t-shirt, a black-coloured bloodstained full pants, a blue underwear and a pair of micro- leather black-coloured shoes from his father's house; the seizure memo for these articles (Ext. P-32) also contained his signature. He identified the articles - clothes, shoes and a broken Samsung mobile phone, recovered by the police from a vacant plot near Maruti showroom under seizure panchnama (Ext. P-33) with the witnesses' signature. He mentioned that the mobile phone's IMEi number was 352450/03/115949/9. 97. PW 7 also witnessed Neha's interrogation where she provided information about committing robbery and murder; and told the police that she had hidden and could point out clothes and sandals worn at the time of incident, and Suzuki Access vehicle (Ext. P-34 ). At her pointing out, the police seized the Suzuki Access Scooty in question, from behind the old OPD ofM.Y. Hospital, from which: one service book, one bloodstained pink full sleeve shirt with white lining, a light blue-coloured jeans with three buttons on the back pocket, a pair of ladies black-coloured high heeled sandals with brown strip attached at the front and in the back of which, above the heels a chain was attached containing bloodstains. These were seized by the police (Ext. P-35) containing the witnesses' signature. PW 7 identified these articles in court. 98. An overall reading of the depositions of PW 7 and PW 13 shows that disclosure statements were made by all the accused in the morning of 23-6-2011. However, the recovery of articles pursuant to the disclosure statements were in the afternoon: Ext. P-29 (which relates to Rahul and evidenced the seizure of the motorcycle, a knife and his clothing) was at 15:30 hrs; Ext. P-30 (which too at the behest of Rahul leading to seizure of a broken camera) at 16:40 hrs; Ext. P-32 (pair of shoes, a t-shirt, a trouser and an underwear seized at the behest of Manoj) at 14:45 hrs; Ext. P-33 (the other seizure at Manoj's behest, of broken mobile phone) at 16:00 hrs; and Ext. P-35 (seizure of clothing items, bloodstained black sandals and Suzuki Scooty, at Neha's behest) at 17.30 hrs. The prosecution made no attempt to show why piecemeal recoveries were made when according to its witnesses, on the very first day i.e. on 22-6-2011, all the three accused had disclosed their roles in the crime and their willingness to cooperate as well as the recovery of the articles related to the crime - including those belonging to them or hidden by them. 99. The second unexplained feature is why two sets of witnesses were joined in the proceedings, on two consecutive dates. PW 3 and PW 6, witnessed the arrest of the three accused, their disclosure statements and recoveries made on the first day i.e. on 22-6-2011. An entirely different set of witnesses were called on the next day i.e. 23-6-2011 (PW 7 and Prakash lchke). Furthermore, one of the recovery witnesses for 23-6-2011 (Prakash lchke) was not examined. As noted previously, the recovery witnesses received phone call at around 7-8 a.m. and were asked to report to the police station which they did at around 8-8.30 a.m. on 23-6-2011; the disclosure statements made by the accused on that day were recorded at different points of time but before 10.00 a.m. However, the prosecution does not explain the absence of any activity between around 10 a.m. and 1. 30 p.m. when the first recovery was made that day.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 417 on his own admission stated that he was acquainted with the deceased family; apparently, his cellphone numbers was known to them. As noted earlier, he also admitted that DW 1 Dipika Shinde had participated in the investigation proceedings that day. 100. All these factors, in the opinion of this Court cast doubt on the prosecution version as to what occurred on the next day i.e. 23-6-2011. 100.1. Given that the accused were detained and arrested in the early morning of 22-6-2011, that they made disclosure statements, and there were recoveries that day at their behest, which were completed that morning itself, the instalment or episodic procedure adopted by the investigation, throws doubts about its veracity. 100.2. Nothing prevented the prosecution from acting on the statements made by the accused and collecting all the evidence - which by its admission was readily available and easily accessible (given the knowledge of the accused which they were willing to share) on the day of their arrest on 22-6-2011. Even if there were some impediments, in terms of, lack of time or otherwise, the involvement of an entirely different set ofpanch witnesses, without explaining why the other witnesses who had evidenced recoveries on 22-6-2011 could not be asked to participate, underlines that doubt. 100.3. The doubt gets further heightened by the fact that PW 7 knew the deceased family - and also claimed that his mobile number was available with them. The 10 (PW 31) does not in his statement say anything about this. He was silent as to why PW 7 instead of the other three was involved in the proceedings in 23-6-2011, and regarding the non-examination of Prakash lchke, the other witness to the recoveries. 100.4. Since all the recoveries were made from open areas with no special features to highlight whether they were from certain hidden spaces, such recoveries of articles cannot be equated with the kind of recoveries made on 22-6-2011. This aspect is important because clothes seized by the police (which according to the prosecution were lying in open area, and thus exposed to elements) were articles from which samples for DNA were collected to ascertain if there were any matches with the DNA markers found on samples collected from the deceased and the crime scene. IV. Testimony of PW 10, the eyewitness 101. The prosecution relied heavily upon the testimony of PW 10. This witness claimed that in the evening of 19-6-2011, he saw two boys trying to start a motorcycle one of them was bleeding from the ankle, and the other, at the forearm. He added that a girl arrived on a Scooty and advised them that it would be better to go to the hospital. The witness alleged that he had informed the police on the day after the incident i.e. 20-6-2011. He stated in cross- examination that after learning about the murder he claimed that he went to the police station. Later, he said that he went there to obtain a \"gumasta\" licence . He admitted that he did not read newspapers but added that when he went to the police station, there was some discussion going on about the murder, upon ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The witness said that he owned a tea shop and worked as a property broker; he later admitted that he did not have any registration as property broker. He also admitted to having previously deposed as a witness on behalf of the police in some other case. PW 10' s presence near the scene of crime, or rather after it, is explained by him, somewhat unconvincingly, as his effort to ascertain if some property was vacant. He is what one can call as a chance witness. 102. A chance witness is one who appears on the scene suddenly. This species of witness was described in Puran v. State of Punjab 26 in the following terms: (SCC p. 459, para 4) \"4 . ... Such witnesses have the habit of appearing suddenly on the scene when something is happening and then of disappearing after noticing the occurrence about which they are called later on to give evidence.\" 103. This Court has sounded a note of caution about dealing with the testimony of chance witnesses. In Darya Singh v. State of Punjab 27 it was observed that: (AIR p. 331, para 6) \"6 . ... where the witness is a close relation of the victim and is shown to share the victim's hostility to his assailant, that naturally makes it necessary for the criminal courts to examine the evidence given by such witness very carefully and scrutinise all the infirmities in that evidence before deciding to act upon it. In dealing with such evidence, courts naturally begin with the enquiry as to whether the said witnesses were chance witnesses or whether they were really present on the scene of the offence. . . . If the criminal court is satisfied that the witness who is related to the victim was not a chance witness, then his evidence has to be examined from the point of view of probabilities and the account given by him as to the assault has to be carefully scrutinised.\" 104. In Jarnail Singh v. State of Punjab 28 again, this Court held that: (SCC p. 725, para 22) \"22. The evidence of a chance witness requires a very cautious and close scrutiny and a chance witness must adequately explain his presence at the place of occurrence (Satbir v. Surat Singh 29 , Harjinder Singh v. State of Punjab 30 , Acharaparambath Pradeepan v. State of Kerala 31 and Sarvesh Narain Shukla v. Daroga Singh 32).

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 419 105. In the opinion of this Court the deposition of this witness (PW 10) cannot be taken at face value. PW 10 improved upon his statement made to a the police and was confronted in this regard. His initial statement to the police did not mention the presence of the girl (whom he identified as Neha in court). Likewise, he improves upon his statement, by deposing in court that the girl had asked two boys to take one injured seriously to the hospital. In addition, his contradictions as to what led him to the police station on 20-0-2011 - obtaining a gumasta licence, or to report the crime; and his presence at the b scene of the crime - as a property broker checking vacancy of a property, who admittedly had no licence for this business, are material. These contradictions are serious inasmuch as they strike at the root of the witness's credibility. His prevarications and improvements especially about the presence of a girl are too serious and fundamental to overlook. Very crucially this witness appears to be a stock witness. For all the aforesaid reasons the depositions of PW 10 cannot c be accepted. d e f g h V. Identification of Manoj by PW 8 106. The prosecution relied on the testimony of PW 8 Achyutmal Tejwani to say that Manoj had obtained treatment from him. The witness, during his deposition stated that he had studied from a Science College in Pakistan. He admitted to not being licensed to practise medicine, by the Medical Council of India; he also admitted that he did not hold any permission to practise as a doctor, but ran Kavita clinic. He identified Manoj in court, and said that on 19-6-2011, Manoj had secured treatment for an injury on his elbow, and another boy (who spoke in Sindhi) accompanied him. He proved Ext. P-37, the slip issued by him, containing the prescription for Manoj, which was seized on 25-6-2011 (Ext. P-36) by the 10 (PW 31), who deposed to it. 107. This Court is of the opinion that PW 8 is not a reliable witness. Apart from the fact that he is admittedly an unqualified professional, and an unlicensed one - at best a quack, the counsel for the appellants quite correctly point out that his previous links with the police cannot be ruled out, for the reason that he migrated, later than during Partition, from Pakistan. The probability of him practising his profession under the shadow of police patronage, for some kind of quid pro quo i.e. being a convenient witness, leaves a lurking suspicion. The police did not involve him during the test identification parade; admittedly, Manoj was in fact taken to him during the investigation. In these circumstances, the testimony of this witness is not credible. This circumstance is therefore, held not to be proved. VI. Test identification parade of the accused 108. The prosecution relied upon the testimonies of PW 10 and PW 18 (Pratap Kumar Agasiya, Naib Tahsildar). Both deposed that PW 10 had correctly identified Manoj and Rahul by specifically tapping their heads. According to PW 18, both the accused were made to stand with 10 other persons resembling them. The result of this identification memo i.e. the test identification parade (\"TIP\") proceedings was recorded as Ext. P-38, where ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 420 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec Manoj and Rahul were identified by PW 10, and Ext. P-40 where only Manoj was identified by PW 11 Raju Sen. Likewise, PW 18 deposed that in a separate proceeding recorded as Ext. P-39, PW 10 had identified Neha from amongst five other girls who had similar physical features. 109. The main argument against the TIP proceedings was that it was held after an inordinate delay. The appellants were arrested on 22-6-2011 and remained in custody till 30-6-2011. It was urged that no attempt was made to involve a Magistrate, to have their TIPs either at that time, or thereafter and that the TIP was held only on 14-7-2011. Ext. P-38, the TIP relating to Rahul and Manoj, records the names of 10 other men who the accused were made to stand with, anywhere as per their choice. Each person was covered with a blanket, up to their neck. It records that no police personnel were present when the proceedings took place, and the witness correctly identified the accused. 110. A popular and widely used method of accused identification, by witness, in criminal trials, is the identification parade. TIP procedures are used, where witnesses who claim to have seen the accused at, or about the time of occurrence to identify such accused from the midst of other individuals, who bear physical attributes similar to them, without any aid or other source. TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and their capability to identify unknown persons. TIPs should normally be conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses' memory. TIPs are conducted during investigation; however, there is no provision of law enabling an accused to claim it as a matter of right, as held in Malkhansingh v. State of M.P. 34 In Ramanathan v. State of T.N. 35 this Court outlined the utility and weight of a TIP. There is no hard-and-fast rule that delay or failure in holding the TIP ipso facto renders the evidence inadmissible or unacceptable; it however, affects the credibility and weight attached to such identification, as held in Shyamal Ghosh v. State of WB. 36 111. This Court has discussed earlier, with respect to credibility of PW l0 ' s testimony and why it cannot be taken at face value. Even otherwise, the fact remains that he omitted to mention basic details about the distance from between where he was, and where he saw the accused. Further, his account suggests that he apparently saw the accused, fleetingly. No attempt was made by the prosecution to draw a sketch or to show the approximate distance from where this witness (who is vital to its case) observed the accused. Given these facts, and the delay (unexplained by the prosecution, which had by its account, wrapped up the case by the end of June 2011) to conduct the TIP after the accused's arrest, renders the TIP suspect. It cannot be said that the TIPs conducted and the subsequent dock identification, by PW 10 of the accused, are among the circumstances proved beyond reasonable doubt. 34 (2003) 5 sec 746 , para 7 : 2003 sec (Cri) 1247 35 (1978) 3 SCC 86, para 18 : 1978 SCC (Cri) 341 36 (2012) 7 sec 646 : (2012) 3 sec (Cri) 685 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 421 VII. Recovery of articles and their test identification 112. On the day of their arrest (22-6-2011), the accused made disclosure statements and pointed out to the police the places where the articles looted, or those relatable to the crime, were kept or hidden. These articles were seized on the same morning. In terms of Ext. P-11, the articles recovered at N eha' s behest inter alia were, two bent golden bangles approximately worth Rs 50,000, a golden pendant, three guriya, and part of a mangalsutra with chain and guriya approximately worth Rs 22,000, Megha's ATM card issued by Bank of India. Similarly, Ext. P-14 (recoveries made at Rahul's be h e st) evidences two bent golden bangles having aeronuma design approximately worth Rs 50,000, a guriya, part of a mangalsutra with chain approximately worth Rs 20,000. Lastly, Ext. P-17 (recoveries made at Manoj' s behest) included inter alia, two bent golden bangles having round design approximately worth Rs 50,000, a guriya, part of a mangalsutra with chain approximately worth Rs 20,000. 113. On the previous day (21-6-2011) , PW 1 Niranjan Deshpande had reported that some articles - 2 ATM cards (Megha and Ashlesha), Megha's mobile, Ashlesha's camera and specific jewellery items (belonging to Megha and Rohini), were missing from the premises. 114. On 9-7-2011, a TIP of the articles was conducted, under the supervision of PW 12 Zamil Khan, who was informed that the procedure was to be conducted. He deposed that the TIP was carried out at the Bharatiya Sangeet Kala Academy, Sector G, MIG Colony, where a policeman from MIG Police Station reached with a sealed packet. One Anil Soni also reached there with a similar packet. He said that two packets were opened and their contents were mixed together. Thereafter PW 1 reached the place; he observed the articles and identified them. PW 12 deposed as follows: \"In the identification, identifier Niranjay Deshpande had identified two gold bangles crumbled, one gold pendal (sic pendant), one broken mangalsutra of a chain and stud with guriya, two gold arrow like bangles, one broken gold mangalsutra, two gold designed bangles, one broken gold mangalsutra of chain and one guriya.\" f 115. The witness also deposed that after the identification was completed, the jewellery was re-sealed and the jewellery items brought by Anil Soni were taken away. He also identified the jewellery ( which had been identified by PW 1 before him) in court. PW 1 deposed among similar lines. The only difference between the two depositions is that PW 1 stated that PW 7 was present (as a matter of fact, he was not, as is evident from the testimony of PW 7). Apart 9 from urging this to be an inconsistency, the counsel for the appellants also cast suspicion on the TIP of the jewellery, urging that neither Anil Soni nor the Police Constable who took the sealed items to the venue of the TIP was examined. In this Court's opinion, these omissions are minor, and do not shake the essential credibility of the proper identification of the jewellery. In fact, during cross-examination, PW 12 clearly deposed that besides him no one h was present during the TIP of the article s and that after PW 1 completed the ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 422 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec identification, he drew the memo (Ext. P-1) and kept the jewellery separately; the rest were taken away by Anil Soni. 116. In this Court's opinion, a joint reading of the testimonies of PW 1 a and PW 12, on the one hand, and the TIP proceedings on the other (Ext. P-1, dated 9-7-2011) establish that the prosecution proved that the identification of the looted articles, were correctly identified by PW 1. The accused's counsel had sought to urge that the articles were common pieces of jewellery, without any distinctive features and that PW 1 could hardly know these - particularly, jewellery of his mother-in-law. If one keeps in mind that PW 1 had reported b the loss of the articles, and listed them specifically, in his statement which was given to the police on 21-6-2011, their subsequent recovery, at the behest and pointing out of the accused, and their correct identification by PW 1 before PW 12, there cannot be doubts on its credibility. During cross-examination, PW 1 was not questioned about how he could identify jewellery articles of his wife, daughter and mother-in-law. c 117. There can be various reasons, why someone may be able to recollect or remember jewellery or other valuables. There cannot be any general assumption that a husband would not be able to remember or recollect the personal articles of his wife, or that a wife cannot be expected to recollect and identify the personal effects of her husband. It all depends on the personality and individual traits of human being, which uniquely differ from each other. It is possible that d PW 1 had an eye for detail; it is equally possible that he was present when the valuables were bought; or yet, it is further possible that they were part of a set, presented to the deceased individuals. The recollection, reporting and identification of the mangalsutra, is more specific. PW 1 could reasonably be assumed to be aware of that article, belonging to Megha, his wife. In these circumstances, the evidence relating to the recovery of items belonging to the e deceased, recovered from the accused's premises at their behest, and their correct identification by PW 1 during TIP were proved beyond reasonable doubt, by the prosecution. VIII. The circumstances relating to expert evidence regarding the appellants' fingerprints t 118. PW 21 Dr Sudhir Sharma, Senior Scientific Officerin Scene of Crime Mobile Unit, deposed that when he reached the crime scene on 19-6-2011 at 6.35 p.m., the main door of the flat was open and not sealed. In his deposition he mentioned the shoe marks and other physical evidence which existed, and also was cross-examined about whether they were tampered with. Additionally, he stated that a computer was in the flat, which could have been seized, but he g was unaware as to whether it was seized or not. 119. PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi (the fingerprint expert) searched the crime scene for possibility of lifting impressions of fingerprints. A set of five fingerprints (i.e. Ext. P-80, \"chance fingerprints\") were lifted by him, and signed by two witnesses (PW 5 and PW 9) as well as himself.

However, this is neither corroborated by the testimony of PW 17 , nor in the exhibits on record. 120. Prints A and B were lifted from the inner back portion of door of bedroom adjoining the bathroom on the first floor; Prints C and D were lifted from the outer portion of door of bedroom adjoining the kitchen; and Print E was lifted from the inner portion of the same door. Upon examination, A, B, D, and E were found suitable for comparison. 121. The fingerprints of the deceased [Ext. P-81 (Megha), Ext. P-82 (Rohini) and Ext. P-83 (Ashlesha)] were lifted by Constable Dinesh on 20-6-2011. Constable Dinesh, however, was not examined by the prosecution in the course of trial. The fingerprints of the three appellants [Ext. P-41 (Rahul), Ext. P-42 (Manoj), and Ext. P-43 (Neha)] were obtained by PW 13 Constable Vijay Singh on 24-6-2011 who deposed in chief examination that he took the signatures of the three accused persons (who were present in court and identified by him) , on their respective fingerprint slips, and later sent them to the SSP Office. In cross-examination he deposed to being trained by the fingerprint department and that he was competent to take prints. He observed an injury/ cut caused by a knife, on the ring finger of Rahul's right hand, and no other injuries on the fingers of the three accused. It also mentioned that he did not obtain any written consent from the accused. 122. The report of the fingerprint expert (Ext. P-84) dated 11-7-2011 by PW 24 K.K. Trivedi, coupled with his testimony, forms the crux of the prosecution case regarding fing erprints. On 27-6-2011 , fingerprints of the accused were received and compared with the chance fingerprints by PW 24, who used the 8-point method and found that Prints A and B matched with the index and middle finger respectively of Rahul's right hand; fingerprint D matched with the middle finger of Manoj' s right hand, and Print E matched with N eha' s right thumb. The fingerprint report was sent to the Director, Finger Print Bureau, Bhopal by PW 24 on 6-7-2011 which was verified by the former vide letter dated 11-7-2011. The prosecution relied on the se findings to corroborate the presence of the appellants at the crime scene. 123. Interestingly, PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi in his chief examination has stated that Letter No. AC Branch/E/80/11 dated 20-6-2011 was sent by Finger Print Branch, Indore to MIG Police Station for comparison of chance fing erprints with the fingerprints of family members/suspects. However, his cross-examination reveals no such letter was on the record. The cross- examination also shows that he did not obtain fingerprints of any other person (including family members of the deceased) or article that was present at the place of the incident, for the purpose of comparison - a point which has been urged by the counsel on behalf of the appellants, laboriously. He also deposed that there was neither a mark of the whole palm on the door, nor bloody fingerprints on the door; and the other fingerprints available on the door were unfit for lifting. 124. The appellants' counsel questioned the circumstances relating to the fingerprint evidence, on grounds such as: (i) absence of any elimination print; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 424 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec (ii) irregularity in obtaining the appellant's fingerprints; (iii) non-examination of Constable Dinesh (who collected the fingerprints of the deceased for the process of elimination) by the prosecution; (iv) the absence of covering letter, a along with the fingerprint expert's report, when produced in court; and (v) the fingerprints of the appellants were not procured in accordance with law, as there was no compliance with the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920. 125. This Court would take up the last argument, at the outset. In Sonvir v. State (NCT of Delhi}37 , it was held that the provisions of the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920, were not mandatory, but rather directory, and that they only b affirm the bona fides of the sample-taking (of the fingerprints of an accused) and eliminate the possibility of evidence fabrication. This Court however, made it clear that not following or complying with the provisions of the Act, would not per se vitiate the evidence, in a given case. This was again affirmedinAshish Jain v. Makrand Singh38_ 126. In the present case, PW 24's deposition corroborates the lifting of c the fingerprints by Constable Dinesh in his presence. Therefore, the non- examination of Constable Dinesh is not fatal to the prosecution's case regarding fingerprints. As far as the integrity of the crime scene is concerned, PW 21 deposed that though the door to the flat was open, when he reached there, the police were standing outside and it was not possible that the crime scene was contaminated. The 10 (PW 31) admitted that the crime scene was not sealed d when the investigation took place on the evening of 19-6-2011; however, he clarified that the Forensic Department personnel who reached the site before him had secured the place. Given this consistent evidence, this Court is of opinion that the possibility of members of the public or unauthorised persons, contaminating the crime scene, so soon after the incident was reported, is remote. e 127. Fingerprints collected at a crime scene from all personnel who were at the scene and who might have inadvertently touched physical evidence, are known as \"elimination prints\". In the present case, elimination prints of the deceased were obtained on 20-6-2021; they were part of the record. The record would show that PW 3, PW 5, PW 9 were present at the crime scene, but admittedly their fingerprints were not obtained. It appears from the testimony of PW 9 that initially, the witnesses were asked to be outside, but later, asked to join the proceedings, to witness the seizures made. All the three witnesses, consistently deposed regarding fingerprint experts' visit to the site, the use of powder on the surfaces and lifting of fingerprints. PW 5, in the cross- examination said that his fingerprint was not obtained. During the hearing, the counsel for the appellants had repeatedly emphasised that elimination prints were not taken from others present at the crime scene; they also highlighted that fingerprints were not lifted from the knives, pistol and ornaments seized from the accused. 37 (2018) 8 sec 24 : (2018) 3 sec (Cri) 486 38 (2019) 3 sec no: (2019) 2 sec (Cri) 256 f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 425 128. In the opinion of this Court, nothing material turns on this aspect. In a recent judgment-which the appellants relied on-i.e. Hari Om v. State of U.P. 23 this Court acquitted the accused, on the ground that the fingerprint expert's opinion, even if accepted, would could not have been the sole basis of conviction. What is important is whether the crime scene was secured, and whether the lifting of prints was witnessed. On both counts, the prosecution evidence is credible and worthy of acceptance. These are also corroborated by the testimony of PW 21, the Senior Scientific Officer, and the crime scene report dated 20-6-2021 (Ext. P-77) tendered by him. 129. The other aspect, relating to fingerprint evidence is that the fingerprint report (Ext. P-84) was prepared on 11-7-2011. Ext. P-85 to Ext. P-92 are photographs of the fingerprints lifted (these were annexed to the fingerprint report, Ext. P-84). The fingerprint report was enclosed with a letter (Ext. P-93). Given that the expert deposed to lifting the prints, which were corroborated by the three witnesses (PW 3, PW 5 and PW 9) apart from the 10, the credibility of this circumstance i.e. the lifting of the prints from the crime scene, their match with the sample prints of the accused, and the expert's testimony stand proved. 130. The appellant's arguments questioning the credibility of this part, on the ground of delay in the report, the prints being chance prints, lack of elimination prints, or the crime scene not being shown to have been secured, etc. are insubstantial and are rejected. IX. Circumstances relating to injuries on the deceased 131. The post-mortem report (Ext. P-44) indicates the extent of injuries on the bodies of the deceased. Megha (aged 46) had a firearm injury on the forehead and 4 deep stab wounds (abdomen, shoulder and chest). Rohini (aged 76) had stab wounds across her body-ranging from her fingers and hands, arms, and numerous injuries on her abdomen and chest which had pierced her vital organs. Similarly, Ashlesha (aged 22) received numerous stab injuries across her body - including, her fingers, hands and forearms, hip, neck, abdomen and chest which pierced her vital organs, back, and many superficial stab wounds on her thighs. 132. The expert opinion of PW 15 Dr Thakur (the doctor who conducted the post-mortem) was that the cause of death of Megha, was shock caused by firearm injuries and haemorrhage. Rohini and Ashlesha' s death was due to shock and haemorrhage from their numerous stab injuries. All three deaths were homicidal in nature. This witness confirmed-both in his opinion and his testimony that all injuries on the three deceased, except the gunshot injury (No. 1-on the body of Megha) could have been caused by the two knives, seized from the possession of Rahul and Manoj, respectively (Articles A and B, forwarded to him for opinion under query Ext. P-47). 23 (2021) 4 sec 345, paras 25, 38-41, 43: (2021) 2 sec (Cri) 440 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Three cartridges (one live, and two shells) were seized by the 10 (PW 31) on 19-6-2011 from the crime scene. He prepared the site map (Ext. P-25 and Ext. P-26) and recovery memo (Ext. P-27) witnessed by PW 5 (landlord Vishal Pandey) and PW 9 (one Mahesh Parmar, neighbour of informant Vishal Pandey). The 10 deposed to preparing the site map witnessed by PW 5 and to seizing one empty, spent cartridge (lying on the floor near the body of Ashlesha), one empty, spent cartridge from near bed, and one unused, live cartridge from near the body (head) of Rohini. He also deposed that all the cartridges had the inscription \"KF 7 .65\" on them. PW 5 deposed that the spot map was prepared in front of him and similarly deposed as to the location of two cartridges - found under the bed and near Rohini' s body. However, the appellants did not cross-examine PW 5 about the number of bullets seized i.e. on the third bullet. PW 9 also deposed on similar lines. 134. PW 15 (doctor conducting the post-mortem examination) deposed that on 20-6-2011, PW 33 S.S Kujur brought the dead body of Megha Deshpande with a cover letter at 11.00 a.m.; and the post-mortem began at around 11.45 a.m. Post-mortem was conducted along with Dr Prashant Rajput and Dr N. Fadse (both were not examined). On post-mortem of deceased Megha's body, a bullet was recovered. The extraction of bullet is described as Wound 1 and the bullet was recovered from anterior of cranium. PW 15 deposed that all the articles were sealed, labelled and handed over to PW 33. The post-mortem report (Ext. P-44) was prepared and taken from M.Y. Hospital to the police station by PW 33 , and a seizure memo (Ext. P-127) was prepared by PW 34 Mahesh Prasad Yadav. The seizure report was witnessed by Head Constable Shambhunath and Constable Ramjan, both of whom were not examined. PW 33's deposition corroborated the facts relating to him and his involvement. 135. Further, PW 15 in his cross-examination stated that the weapon was shot in contact with the body and that he could not state which weapon caused injuries to Megha. In cross-examination, PW 33 admitted that no specimen seal was obtained by him from the doctor and no receipt was given to the doctor upon receiving the said articles. Further, he stated that on 19-6-2011 he took the bodies to the hospital by police vehicle after 6.00 p.m. He deposed to going home after locking the mortuary (as it was night-time) and leaving the keys in the hospital. PW 34 Mahesh Prasad Yadav deposed about preparing of seizure memo (Ext. P-127) on 20-6-2011 upon presentation of the articles by PW 33; and in cross-examination he admitted to not sending a copy of seizure memo to the hospital, not filling Column 10 regarding description of the seized items, the sample se al not being marked, and that he did not mark the number of articles on the items mentioned in the seizure memo. He further deposed that he did not open the packets to see what was inside and also did not receive the post- mortem report himself, but only made a roznamcha entry regarding seizure of items. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The joint reading of the testimonies of PW 15, PW 33 and PW 34 establishes that a bullet was extracted by the doctor (PW 15), and a seizure memo was prepared in connection; the articles seized were then sealed (although no mark was placed on the seal). B. Recovery of bullet from Rahul and facts relating to it 137. Parallel to the recovery of the cartridges from the crime scene, the prosecution story was that the accused Rahul suffered a bullet injury during the incident. The prosecution alleged that Rahul went to Annapurna Police Station and reported a false case of shooting. As to this, PW 30 R.S. Makwana, (ASI Annapurna PS) deposed that on 19-6-2011 he saw Rahul alias Govind coming to the police station in an autorickshaw alleging that someone shot him in the foot and that he was going to District Hospital for treatment. He gave the information to PW 29 Gauri Shankar Chadar. PW 30 along with Constable Dinesh (who was not examined) went to District Hospital. A dehati nalisi was prepared (Ext. P-103). Later PW 30 went back to the police station to register the FIR (Ext. P-107). PW 26 Dr Mukesh B achawat (Medical Officer in District Hospital) examined Rahul at around 22:40 hrs , and prepared medical report (Ext. P-97), before referring Rahul to M .Y. Hospital. Constable Dinesh accompanied Rahul to M.Y. Hospital for his treatment. During the early hours of 20-6-2011, PW 32 Dr Nilesh Guru examined Rahul and removed the bullet from his right foot. It was deposited in the MLC section of the hospital (Ext. P-113). PW 30 stated that he took the sealed packet from M.Y. Hospital on 23-6-2011 which contained the bullet extracted from Rahul alias Govind's foot. Shivraj Singh Raghuwanshi (not examined) prepared the seizure memo which was exhibited as Ext. P-108 (Article Z-7) and PW 22 witnessed it. In the cross- examination, PW 30 was questioned about the condition of the bullet, whether it had traces of blood, etc. 138. The appellants argued that the prosecution failed to establish that the bullet in fact was extracted from Rahul's right foot and it was the one sent to the ballistic expert. The case made out was that the boy examined by PW 26 and PW 32 was not Rahul at all. However, on that score, there cannot be any doubt because PW 29 G.S. Chadar, who recorded the dehati nalisi identified Rahul in the court as Govind, who had reported that he was shot on the foot by an unknown person and reported the matter to PS Annapurna. Furthermore, the signatures of the complainant on the dehati nalisi (Ext. P-103) are identical to the signatures of the appellant Rahul in his statement under Section 313 CrPC. The doubt sought to be raised with respect to the manner of seizure of bullet in this Court's opinion, is not merited. 139. The identification of Rahul by PW 29, the deposition of PW 30 and PW 31 (10) show that the doctor who extracted the bullet initially kept it in safe custody with the hospital itself in the MLC section, which was later retrieved by PW 30 on 23-6-2011 and the seizure made on the same day in MIG Police Station. PW 22 Bharat Singh Thakur was in fact a witness to the seizure memo (Ext. P-78, seized as Ext. P-108 by PS MIG Police Station).

The ballistics report (Ext. P-52) was prepared by PW 16 Bheem Bahadur, Head Constable at DRP Line, lndore. It described the nature of the firearm seized, and cartridges recovered. The examination report prepared by the State Forensic Science Laboratory (Ext. 120) stated that on chemical examination of blood found on a piece of bandage (swab of gunshot wound of deceased), it was not found positive for nitrate, copper or lead. However, the report stated that two bullets were compatible to the certified bullet of 7 .65 mm calibre cartridge, and bullet TB-Al were found similar. Three pieces of skin, found copper positive. Importantly, according to the report, two bullets (EB2 and EBl) recovered from the body ofMegha, the deceased, and Rahul's right foot respectively, were fired from pistol Ext. A-1. The report also stated that the bullet fired at the right shoe (seized on 22-6-2011 under seizure memo Ext. P-75, which was proved by PW 20) was caused by a copper-jacketed bullet. Ext. P-120, which was exhibited by the 10 (PW 31), also listed inter alia, several articles such as Article A-5 (containing two fired empty shells of 7 .65 mm calibre cartridge which were marked as EC-1 & EC-2); Article A-6 (containing live 7.65 mm calibre pistol cartridge which was marked as LR-1); Article A-10 (containing bloodstained Vicks bottle); Article B-5 (containing three small pieces of skin jointly marked SK-1); Article B-6 (containing one piece of bandage cloth with substance thereon); Article F-1 (a country-made pistol A-1); Article F-6, (containing one right leg shoe) and Article F-7 (a bullet marked as EB-1). 141. The ballistics report, dated 14-7-2011, stated that PW 16 Bhim Bahadur, ballistics expert test fired from the pistol received from the MIG Police in a sealed packet. The ballistic report stated inter alia, that \"These are empty shells of used cartridge of7 .65 mm calibre pistol and on whose head stamp \"KF\" is marked. They have mark of firing pin/breach face. On comparison through microscope both are found alike as well as like test fire cartridge TC-Al. The photo-micrograph has been taken for alike situation of Ext.

A sample of blood found on the floor of the incident where the body of deceased Megha was lying, was collected on a cotton swab, marked as A-1 and put in a paper envelope. Similarly, a sample of blood found near deceased Rohini, was marked as A-2 and sample of blood near deceased Ashlesha, was marked as A-3. A sample of plain cotton was also placed in a paper envelope and marked as A-4, as per seizure memo (Ext. P-27) prepared by the 10 at the crime scene. The seizure of these samples/articles (among others) from the crime scene is corroborated by the testimony of PW 5 and PW 9 who are also witnesses to Ext. P-27. PW 17 Satyanarayan Patel (crime scene photographer) had photographed the crime scene (Ext. P-61 to Ext. P-65). These photos show bloodstains as well as the position, and direction of the bodies. The clothes (B-1, C-1, D-1), vaginal swabs (B-2, C-2, D-2) and pubic hairs (B-3, C-3, D-3) were also taken from each of the deceased - Megha, Rohini and Ashlesha, respectively. 144. The clothes from which DNA material was obtained from the accused, were recovered pursuant to disclosure statements (Ext. P-28, Ext. P-31, and Ext. P-34) made on 23-6-2011. Seizures of the relevant clothing articles (Ext. P-29, Ext. P-32, and Ext. P-35) were drawn in the presence of PW 7 Sandeep Narulkar and Prakash lchke (who was not examined by the prosecution), which as discussed at length earlier - throws some doubt on the recoveries made on 23-6-2011. In addition to their clothes, the prosecution submitted that DNA material was also extracted from the knife seized from Manoj on 22-6-2011 (Ext. P-14), and the iron knife from Rahul on 23-6-2011 (Ext. P-29). 145. The deposition of PW 35 Dr Pankaj Srivastava, Scientific Officer, DNA Fingerprint Unit FSL, Sagar, read with the DNA report dated 10-8-2011 (Ext. P-122) prepared by him, provide details of the DNA analysis. This witness stated that the department received 19 exhibits concerning this case on 14-7-2011, in a sealed condition, which as per his cross, he examined on 18-7-2011. The expert's report reveals that DNA was extracted through the Automated DNA Extraction System 12 GC and Organic extraction. 16 desired genetic markers were taken from DNA to be tested by Amplification Multiple PCR Technique. Thus, genotyping profile was obtained along with Automated DNA sequencer of amplified DNA, AmfF/STR Identifier kit, AmpF/STR Y Filer kit. The analysis of the results was done by gene mapping software v3.5. PW 35 clarified that \"physical substance\" mentioned in the report is meant to be blood. 146. All of the articles obtained in connection to Megha (cotton swab of blood near her body A-1, clothes B-1, vaginal smear slide B-2, bullet seized from her body B-4) were compared and uniform female DNA profile was found. Similarly, a uniform female DNA profile was found in the case of articles in connection to Rohini (A-2, C-1, C-2) and Ashlesha (A-3, D-1, D-3). These DNA profiles were then compared with the DNA material extracted from the clothes of the three accused, and the two knives recovered from Rahul and Manoj, which form a part of the DNA report. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The conclusions of the DNA matches and consequent opinion of PW 35 in the report, are summarised in the below table: Victim Articles of accused iA-1,B-1,B-2andB-4 iClothes (Ext. F-4) and knife (Ext.

DNA material found on the bloodstained bedsheet seized from the scene of the crime (Ext. A-9) indicated presence of mixed DNA profile of the deceased i.e. DNA material of more than one individual. There is no mention a b of DNA material on the articles matching Rohini's DNA profile. As is evident c from the above table, the DNA material which the prosecution relies on, is that of the victims which according to the prosecution, was found on articles recovered from the possession of the accused. It is not a case of having found DNA material of the accused, at the crime scene or on the bodies of the deceased. Hence, the fingernail clippings (Exts. P-18, P-19 and P-20) taken from the accused at the time of arrest, seem to have not been considered/used. d 149. During the cross-examination what was put to PW 35, was whether: (a) the time period between seizure/incident and examination would have any bearing on the DNA analysis, (b) there was a cut mark in Manoj's clothes (G-3), (c) the articles were in sealed condition, (d) the clothes had to be kept in a particular condition, and if blood could mix when clothes kept together - the answers to which are satisfactory. However, the typographical error of e mentioning ID 3074 as ID 3078 raises concern and was pressed upon by the counsel for the appellants. 150. Before this Court, the appellants have raised concerns regarding the unexplained delay in sending the articles seized on 23-6-2011 only 20 days later on 13-7-2011 (Ext. P-115) and the condition in which they were preserved, the lack of statistical analysis, and that the observation sheet on which PW 35 deposed to have made notings on, was not placed on the record. Serologist reports prepared by Dr M.P. Singh (Exts. P-123 and P-124) are also on the record which reveal that blood was present on one bullet (B-4), but blood quantity was not enough to run tests. This naturally raises a question on whether it was possible to extract DNA, at all. The other articles mentioned in the serologist's report were A-10 (Vicks bottle), F-2 (Rahul's left shoe), F-3 (Rahul's nails), F-6 (Rahul's right shoe), F-7 (bullet recovered from Rahul's right foot), G-2 (Manoj's nails), G-4 (Manoj's shoes), H-1 (Neha's nails) and H-3 (Neha's sandals). However, the bloodstains were too disintegrated or the quantity of blood on the articles, was not sufficient to run classification tests. f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

During the hearing, an article published by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Kolkata39 was relied upon. The relevant extracts of the article are reproduced below: \"Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is genetic material present in the nuclei of cells of living organisms. An average human body is composed of about 100 trillion of cells. DNA is present in the nucleus of cell as double helix, supercoiled to form chromosomes along with intercalated proteins. Twenty-three pairs of chromosomes present in each nucleated cells and an individual inherits 23 chromosomes from mother and 23 from father transmitted through the ova and sperm respectively. At the time of each cell division, chromosomes replicate and one set goes to each daughter cell. All information about internal organisation, physical characteristics, and physiological functions of the body is encoded in DNA molecules in a language (sequence) of alphabets of four nucleotides or bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) along with sugar phosphate backbone. A human haploid cell contains 3 billion bases approx. All cells of the body have exactly same DNA but it varies from individual to individual in the sequence of nucleotides. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) found in large number of copies in the mitochondria is circular, double stranded, 16,569 base pair in length and shows maternal inheritance. It is particularly useful in the study of people related through the maternal line. Also being in large number of copies than nuclear DNA, it can be used in the analysis of degraded samples. Similarly, the Y chromosome shows paternal inheritance and is employed to trace the male lineage and resolve DNA from males in sexual assault mixtures. Only 0.1 % of DNA (about 3 million bases) differs from one person to another. Forensic DNA Scientists analyse only few variable regions to generate a DNA profile of an individual to compare with biological clue materials or control samples. * * * DNA Profiling Methodology f DNA profile is generated from the body fluids, stains, and other biological specimen recovered from evidence and the results are compared with the results obtained from reference samples. Thus, a link among victim(s) and/or suspect(s) with one another or with crime scene can be established. DNA profiling is a complex process of analyses of some highly variable regions of DNA. The variable areas of DNA are termed genetic g markers. The current genetic markers of choice for forensic purposes are Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). Analysis of a set of 15 STRs employing Automated DNA Sequencer gives a DNA profile unique to an individual (except monozygotic twin). Similarly, STRs present on Y chromosome (Y-STR) can also be used in sexual assault cases or determining paternal lineage. In cases of sexual assaults, Y-STRs are helpful in detection of male h 39 DNA Profiling in Justice Delivery System, Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Directorate of Forensic Science, Kolkata (2007). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Cases in which DNA had undergone environmental stress and biochemical degradation, min lSTRs can be used for over routine STR because of shorter amplicon size. DNA profiling is a complicated process and each sequential step involved in generating a profile can vary depending on the facilities available in the laboratory. The analysis principles, however, remain similar, which include: 1. isolation, purification & quantitation of DNA 2. amplification of selected genetic markers 3. visualising the fragments and genotyping 4. statistical analysis & interpretation. In mtDNA analysis, variations in Hypervariable Region I & II (HVR I & II) are detected by sequencing and comparing results with control samples: Statistical Analysis Atypical DNA case involves comparison of evidence samples, such as semen from a rape, and known or reference samples, such as a blood sample from a suspect. Generally, there are three possible outcomes of profile comparison: (1) Match: If the DNA profiles obtained from the two samples are indistinguishable, they are said to have matched. (2) Exclusion: If the comparison of profiles shows differences, it can only be explained by the two samples originating from different sources. (3) Inconclusive: The data does not support a conclusion of the three possible outcomes , only the \"match\" between samples needs to be supported by statistical calculation. Statistics attempt to provide meaning to the match. The match statistics are usually provided as an estimate of the Random Match Probability (RMP) or in other words, the frequency of the particular DNA profile in a population. In case of paternity/maternity testing, exclusion at more than two loci is considered exclusion. An allowance of 1 or 2 loci possible mutations should be taken into consideration while reporting a match. Paternity or Maternity indices and likelihood ratios are calculated further to support the match.

The exhibits having biological specimen, which can establish link among victim(s), suspect(s), scene of crime for solving the case should be identified, preserved, packed and sent for DNA profiling.\" 152. In an earlier judgment, R v. Dohoney & Adams40 the UK Court of Appeal laid down the following guidelines concerning the procedure for introducing DNA evidence in trials: (1) the scientist should adduce the evidence of the DNA comparisons together with his calculations of the random occurrence ratio; (2) whenever such evidence is to be adduced, the Crown (prosecution) should serve upon the defence details as to how the calculations have been carried out, which are sufficient for the defence to scrutinise the basis of the calculations; (3) the Forensic Science Service should make available to a defence expert, if requested, the databases upon which the calculations have been based. 153. The Law Commission of India in its Report41 , observed as follows: \"DNA evidence involves comparison between genetic material thought to come from the person whose identity is in issue and a sample of genetic material from a known person. If the samples do not \"match\", then this will prove a lack of identity between the known person and the person from whom the unknown sample originated. If the samples match, that does not mean the identity is conclusively proved. Rather, an expert will be able to derive from a database of DNA samples, an approximate number reflecting how often a similar DNA \"profile\" or \"fingerprint\" is found. It may be, for example, that the relevant profile is found in 1 person in every 1,00,000: This is described as the \"random occurrence ratio\" (Phipson 1999, 15th Edn., Para 14.32). Thus, DNA may be more useful for purposes of investigation but not for raising any presumption of identity in a court of law.\" ( emphasis in original) 154. In Dharam Deo Yadav v. State of U.P. 42 this Court discussed the reliability of DNA evidence in a criminal trial, and held as follows: (SCC pp. 528-29, para 36) \"36. The DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, which is the biological blueprint of every life. DNA is made up of a double stranded structure consisting of a deoxyribose sugar and phosphate backbone, cross-linked with two types of nucleic acids referred to as adenine and guanine, purines and thymine and cytosine pyrimidines ....

More than half a century, samples of human DNA began to be used in the criminal justice system. Of course, debate lingers over the safeguards that should be required in testing samples and in presenting the evidence in court. DNA profile, however, is consistently held to be valid and reliable, but of course, it depends on the quality control and quality assurance procedures in the laboratory.\" b 155. The US Supreme Court in District Attorney's Office for the Third Judicial District v. Osborne43 dealt with a post-conviction claim to access evidence, at the behest of the convict, who wished to prove his innocence, through new DNA techniques. It was observed, in the context of the facts, that: (SCC OnLine US SC) \"Modern DNA testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike anything known before. Since its first use in criminal investigations in the mid-1980s, there have been several major advances in DNA technology, culminating in STR technology. It is now often possible to determine whether a biological tissue matches a suspect with near certainty. While of course many criminal trials proceed without any forensic and scientific testing at all, there is no technology comparable to DNA testing for matching tissues when such evidence is at issue. . ..

Generally, when DNA profile of a sample found at the scene of crime matches with DNA profile of the suspect, it can generally be concluded that both samples have the same biological origin. DNA profile is valid and reliable, but variance in a particular result depends on the quality control and quality procedure in the laboratory.\" 157. This Court, in one of its recent decisions, Pattu Rajan v. State of T.N. 53 , considered the value and weight to be attached to a DNA report: (SCC p. 791, para 52) \"52. Like all other opinion evidence, the probative value accorded to DNA evidence also varies from case to case, depending on facts and circumstances and the weight accorded to other evidence on record, whether contrary or corroborative. This is all the more important to remember, given that even though the accuracy of DNA evidence may be increasing with the advancement of science and technology with every passing day, thereby making it more and more reliable, we have not yet reached a juncture where it may be said to be infallible. Thus, it cannot be said that the absence of DNA evidence would lead to an adverse inference against a party, especially in the presence of other cogent and reliable evidence on record in favour of such party.\" 158. This Court, therefore, has relied on DNA reports, in the past, where the guilt of an accused was sought to be established. Notably, the reliance, was to corroborate. This Court highlighted the need to ensure quality in the testing and eliminate the possibility of contamination of evidence; it also held that being an opinion, the probative value of such evidence has to vary from case to case. 159. In the present case, what is apparent, is that PW 35 has virtually echoed the DNA analysis in his chief examination, and not chosen to elaborate on the random occurrence ratio i.e. the probability of the accused's samples matching with those allegedly found at the crime scene. This Court has already discussed whether the recoveries of 23-6-2011 pursuant to disclosures made that day can be accepted and held that they are suspect and need to be discarded. This leaves the report, to the extent it says that samples lifted from recoverie s made at the crime scene matched with what was seized on 22-6-2011 (knives, and other articles), to be inconclusive. 160. It is noteworthy that seizure Memo Ext. 27, in terms of which Article A-9 (ID 3063) is said to have been seized, does not record that as a matter of fact, a bedsheet was seized. If one keeps in mind that source H2 (ID 3078) in relation to Neha was seized on 23-4-2011, and from an open area, the like lihood of its contamination-even if arguendo the genuineness of its recovery might have been accepted-carried some degree of probability. For these reasons, it is held that the DNA report in the present case cannot have a clinching, or high degree of probative value. 53 (2019) 4 sec 111 : (2019) 2 sec (Cri) 354 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

P-77) prepared by PW 21 Dr Sudhir Sharma described the scene of the crime. It mentioned that three types of a blooded partial shoeprints were found in the following areas: (a) near the table at the crime scene; (b) in the pool of blood near the body of Ashlesha; and (c) on the floor near the almirahs. 162. PW 21 did not, in his cross-examination remember the number of partial shoeprints found at the incident (which he later says were at 2-3 places), but states that there were three kinds of prints. He also mentioned that no dust was present, and therefore barefoot prints were not possible. In his chief examination, PW 21 mentioned that at his instruction, PW 17 (crime scene photographer) took scaled photographs of the blood-smeared partial shoeprints found at the place of the incident (which are Ext. P-66 to Ext. P-74). This is not mentioned in the chief examination of PW 17; who only later in his cross, states that he had taken 8x 12 scaled photos of the footprints and locations with bloodstains, which were Ext. P-66 to Ext. P-74. 163. As already elaborated earlier, Manoj's shoes were seized at his behest (Ext. P-31, Ext. P-32) and sandals from Neha based on her disclosure (Ext. P-34, Ext. P-35) on 23-6-2011. Rahul's right shoe was seized by Annapurna PS on 22-6-2011 which is corroborated by the testimony of PW 20 Harbhajan Singh (independent witness), who stated that Abhay Tiwari (not examined) had spotted the bloodstained shoe in his garden and reported it to the police, and that both of them were witnesses to the seizure memo (Ext. P-75). The left shoe was seized (Ext. P-21) pursuant to disclosure made by Rahul to the 10. 164. In furtherance of Ext. P-115 letter dated 13-7-2011 sent by the 10 to the State Forensic Laboratory, examination report of shoeprints dated 13-9-2011 was prepared. This report stated that, the exhibits were received by the Ballistics Branch on 2-8-2011 in sealed condition. For comparative examination, sample prints of soles of shoes ofExts. F-2, F-6, and G-4 and sandals of Ext. H-3 were made (photographs 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14). The shoeprints found were merely mentioned together - it is unclear as to which photograph (#10, 11, etc.) is the sample of which shoe (F-2, F-5, etc.). 165. This Court is of the opinion that much weight cannot be attached to the footprint evidence in this case. The report explicitly notes that shoeprints are incomplete and unclear, and that specific and clear opinion could not be given. Yet, the expert proceeded to give his opinion about the matching of the prints. In State of Bihar v. Kapil Singh 54 this Court had held that evidence of an expert relating to presence of a footprint, at the best is of a weak nature. This view was also shared by Mohd. Aman v. State of Rajasthan 11 and Balbir Singh v. State of Punjab 22 . The prosecution, in the opinion of this Court, has not proved this circumstance. 54 (1968) 3 SCR 810: AIR 1969 SC 53 11 (1997) 10 sec 44: 1997 sec (Cri) 777 22 1996 sec (Cri) 1158 b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In one of its earlier decisions this Court had in Hanumant v. State of M.P. 55 indicated that the correct approach of courts trying criminal cases involving circumstantial evidence should be that the circumstances alleged, be fully established; all the facts so established should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the accused; circumstances should be conclusive and of such tendency that they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. This view was followed later in Tu fail v. State of U.P. 56 and Ram Gopal v. State of Maharashtra 57 • All these and other decisions were revisited in the three-Judge Bench decision in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra 24 and the Court enunciated a set of principles that every court trying criminal cases entirely based on circumstantial evidence had to follow. 167. The conclusions recorded by this Court in Sharad24 were listed in para 152 (which were characterised in para 153 as \"five golden principles\"). They are extracted below: (SCC p. 185, paras 153-54) \"153 . ... (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established. It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned \"must or should\" and not \"may be\" established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between \"may be proved\" and \"must be or should be proved\" as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra 58 where the following observations were made: (SCC p. 807, para 19) '19 .. .. Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between \"may be\" and \"must be\" is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions.' (2) The facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency. ( 4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved, and (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused. 55 (1952) 2 sec 71 : AIR 1952 SC 343 56 (1969) 3 sec 19s : 1910 sec (Cri) 55 57 (1972) 4 sec 625 24 (1984) 4 sec 116: 1984 sec (Cri) 487 58 (1973) 2 sec 793: 1973 sec (Cri) 1033 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

These five the panchsheel of evidence.\" SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec golden principles, if we may say so, constitute the proof of a case based on circumstantial (emphasis in original) 168. These principles have stood the test of time, and the evidence in all criminal cases, has been evaluated in their light, throughout the country. In light of these binding principles this Court would now examine whether the circumstances supported by evidence i.e. those accepted by this Court in the previous part of the judgment, were of such conclusion as to stand the test of the five golden principles enunciated in Sarda 24 . Summation of proof of circumstances 169. The prosecution relied upon several circumstances which were accepted concurrently by the courts below. These were the depositions of PW 10, the chance witness, who claimed to have witnessed all three accused fleeing the spot around 5.45 or 6.00 p.m. on the day of the incident; the recovery of articles from the crime scene (fired cartridge, live bullet, sunglasses, black beads, etc.) and lifting of the fingerprints (testified by PW 24 and corroborated by witnesses PW 5 and PW 9); and seizure of stolen articles pursuant to disclosure by the accused. PW 1 who recorded his statement a day after the incident (on 21-6-2011), specifically reported the loss of jewellery items such as four pairs of bangles, mangalsutra, ATM cards, etc. These were later recovered at the direction of the accused, which the prosecution claimed to be a breakthrough. 170. It was found by the courts below that Neha was arrested in the morning of 22-6-2011 after she was found suspiciously loitering by PW 28. The arrest occurred after she was searched and later questioned. The arrest was witnessed PW 3 and PW 6 who also deposed to witnessing the police recording Neha's disclosure statement. Recoveries of valuables and articles, such as two pairs of golden bangles, part of a broken mangalsutra, other valuables and an ATM card, which belonged to Megha were from her house. Neha's disclosure statement about the involvement of other accused (Rahul and Manoj) led to their arrest and disclosure statements on the same day - all of which was witnessed by PW 3 and PW 6. Again, gold jewellery items were recovered from Rahul's premises as also a country-made pistol, and subsequently, a knife. In addition, a photograph with him wearing sunglasses was seized from his house. Manoj was likewise arrested and his disclosure statement led to the recovery of a knife , a pair of golden bangles, part of a broken mangalsutra , etc. Later during the same day on 22-6-2011, a right shoe was recovered by another police station (Annapurna PS). It was seized; which was witnessed by PW 20. At that time, its connection with the murders was unknown. 171. The prosecution also relied on a disclosure statement said to have been recorded on 23-6-2011 leading to the recovery of clothes at the behest of Neha, Rahul and Manoj from various open sites. Further, at Neha's behest a Scooty with a service book was recovered and seized, and at Manoj's behest, 24 Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 439 a motorcycle reportedly stolen was found. These recoveries were witnessed by PW 7 an independent witness. The prosecution relied upon two sets of TIP proceedings, which sought to identify on the one hand, Manoj and Rahul, and on the other, Neha. It also relied upon the TIP proceedings in which PW 1 identified the stolen articles which he had reported loss of, on 21-6-2011 itself. The prosecution had relied upon other evidence such as the match of fingerprints, in terms of the expert's report (Ext. P-84, by PW 24), upon the reports of the ballistic expert (PW 16), and of the DNA expert (PW 35). It also sought to rely upon the report of another expert who spoke about the probability of shoeprint match. 172. In the preceding discussion of the evidence in the earlier part of this judgment, this Court has held that though the prosecution version of how Neha was arrested had to be disbelieved, it did not taint her subsequent disclosure, which led to the seizure and recovery of stolen articles from her premises - four stolen pieces of jewellery, and an ATM card which belonged to Megha, the deceased (proved by PW 27, bank official). The previous discussion of the evidence relating to the other accused led this Court to infer that the prosecution was able to prove the recovery of articles seized on 22-6-2011 from the premises of Rahul and Manoj i.e. golden bangles, parts of a broken mangalsutra, each from the houses of the accused, a country-made pistol and a knife, from Rahul's house at his behest. This Court also concluded that the TIP proceedings conducted in respect of the stolen articles was validly proved by the prosecution. 173. The report of the ballistic expert PW 16, has been held to have established that the seized bullets (from the crime scene), matched with the test fired bullet from the pistol seized from Rahul's house at his behest. The recovery of a right shoe with a bullet hole on 22-6-2011, likewise was proved by the prosecution. The other circumstance which the prosecution relied upon in this context, pointing to Rahul's involvement was his treatment by PW 32. Rahul had late in the evening of 19-6-2011, reported to PS Annapurna, that he was shot on the right foot, by some unknown assailants which was recorded by PW 29, who also identified him in the court. PW 29 further deposed that Rahul first went to District Hospital and was treated by PW 26, who then referred him to M.Y. Hospital. Later in the early hours of 20-6-2011 Rahul was operated upon by PW 32 who extracted the bullet, sealed it and kept it with the MLC cell. This bullet was seized by the police and sent to the ballistic expert (PW 24) who in his report supported the prosecution's version that the bullet was fired from the same weapon which had discharged the bullet that was extracted from the deceased Megha's body. 174. This Court has disbelieved the prosecution allegation with respect to the circumstances surrounding Neha's arrest, principally because of the evidence of DW 1. It is quite clear that DW 1 Deepika Shinde was involved to an extent during the initial stages of the investigation and according to the police records, was responsible for the breakthrough which led among others, to her out-of-turn promotion, swiftly.

Further, the Court has not accepted the prosecution's story with respect to the chance witnesses, PW 10 and his identification of the accused in TIP proceedings. 175. During the hearing, the appellants' counsel had urged that the findings of the trial court are unsustainable, because they overlooked several lacunae which cumulatively tended to undermine the prosecution's case . The omission to examine certain witnesses (such as PW l 's driver, Nandakumar; Abhay Tiwari, who along with PW 20 found the right shoe with a bullet hole; Amit Soni, who went to the TIP of articles, with some jewellery items; Prakash lchke, who witnessed the recoveries and seizures on 23-6-2011, Constable Dinesh, who accompanied Rahul to M.Y. Hospital, etc.). It was also emphasised that the silence of certain witnesses (such as PW 4, in regard to whether she witnessed the arrest, and search of Neha; of PW 19, who was silent about receiving a report from PW 28 regarding Neha's suspicious activitie s in the morning of 22-6-2011; silence by prosecution witnesses about DW l ' s role) , too, cast grave doubts about the prosecution version . Furthermore, it was contended that the seizure, sealing, transmission of articles found at the crime scene and recovered from the accused's premises, as well as open areas, as well as their chain of custody was not proved. 176. This Court has previously discussed the probative value of the evidence relied on by the prosecution, and rejected the way in which Neha was apprehended, the recoveries made on 23-6-2011, the TIP of the accused, the deposition of PW 10 and of PW 8, and the DNA and shoeprint analysis. The first que stion is whether having regard to the rejection of some of the prosecution evidence, the case against the accused, as a whole, stands disproved. This aspect has been considered in earlier decisions of this Court where defects in investigation, or lapses in the recollection during testimonies of witnesses, were involved. 177. In State of U.P. v. Anil Singh 59 , this Court observed as follows: (SCC p. 692, para 17) \"17. It is also our experience that invariably the witnesses add embroidery to prosecution story, perhaps for the fear of being disbelieved. But that is no ground to throw the case overboard, if true, in the main. If there is a ring of truth in the main, the case should not be rejected. It is the duty of the court to cull out the nuggets of truth from the evidence unless there is reason to believe that the inconsistencies or falsehood are so glaring as utterly to destroy confidence in the witnesses. It is necessary to remember that a Judge does not preside over a criminal trial mere ly to see that no innocent man is punished. A Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. One is as important as the other. Both are public duties which the Judge has to perform.\" 59 1988 Supp sec 686 : 1989 sec (Cri) 48 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

State of T.N. 60 it was held that: (SCC p. 589, para 55) \"55 . ... the defect in the investigation by itself cannot be a ground for acquittal. If primacy is given to such designed or negligent investigations or to the omissions or lapses by perfunctory investigation, the faith and confidence of the people in the criminal justice administration would be eroded. Where there has been negligence on the part of the investigating agency or omissions, etc. which resulted in defective investigation, there is a legal obligation on the part of the court to examine the prosecution evidence dehors such lapses, carefully, to find out whether the said evidence is reliable or not and to what extent it is reliable and as to whether such lapses affected the object of finding out the truth.\" 179. A similar approach was adopted in Surajit Sarkar v. State of W.B. 61 and Shanker v. State of M.P. 62 In Harijana Thirupala v. Public Prosecutor6 3 this Court said that: (Harijana Thirupala case63 , SCC p. 476, para 11) \"J 1 . ... The case of the prosecution must be judged as a whole having regard to the totality of the evidence. In appreciating the evidence, the approach of the court must be integrated not truncated or isolated. In other words, the impact of evidence in totality on the prosecution case or innocence of the accused has to be kept in mind in coming to the conclusion as to the guilt or otherwise of the accused. In reaching a conclusion about the guilt of the accused, the court has to appreciate, analyse and assess the evidence placed before it by the yardstick of probabilities, its intrinsic value and the animus of witnesses.\" 180. This Court has further emphasised that if discrepancies in the depositions are minor, or that witnesses contradict themselves during their testimonies (as opposed to their previous police statements) what is important is the nature of contradictions. In Ram mi v. State of M.P. 64 , this Court held that: (SCC p. 656, para 24) \"24 . ... courts should bear in mind that it is only when discrepancies in the evidence of a witness are so incompatible with the credibility of his version that the court is justified in jettisoning his evidence. But too serious a view to be adopted on mere variations falling in the narration of an incident (either as between the evidence of two witnesses or as between two statements of the same witness) is an unrealistic approach for judicial scrutiny.\" 60 c2010) 9 sec 567 : c2010) 3 sec (Cri) 1402 61 c2013) 2 sec 146: c2013) 1 sec (Cri) 877 h 62 (2018) 15 sec 725: (2019) 2 sec (Cri) 868 63 c2002) 6 sec 470: 2002 sec (Cri) 1310 64 (1999) s sec 649 : 2000 sec (Cri) 26 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 442 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec 181. In Appabhai v. State of Gujarat65 , it was ruled that: (SCC p. 246, para 13) \"13. . . . The court while appreciating the evidence must not attach undue importance to minor discrepancies. The discrepancies which do not shake the basic version of the prosecution case may be discarded.\" 182. In a similar vein, it was observed, in Vinod Kumar v. State of Haryana 66 that: (SCC p. 149, para 24) \"24 . ... Only when discrepancies in the evidence of a witness are so incompatible with the credibility of his version that it would be justified in jettisoning his evidence.\" 183. The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses, therefore, does not ipso facto favour an accused. What is important, however, is whether the omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and incredulous. In the present case, the omission to depose about certain facts, by PW 4, or PW 19, or any other witness cannot inure to the accused's benefit. Each of the facts they omitted, was supported by one or more witnesses. 184. Likewise, the failure to examine certain persons, like Anil Soni, Prakash Ichke, Abhay Tiwari, or Nandakumar, cannot inure to the accused's benefit. Anil Soni was present during the TIP of seized articles, when other similar articles brought by him, for comparison and identification by PW 1. The latter witness was able to identify the articles which had been seized from the accused; this was deposed to by PW 12, whose testimony cannot be doubted. The failure to examine Anil Soni therefore, was a lapse, but not a fatal one, as far as the TIP itself went. Likewise, the failure to examine Prakash Ichke is of no consequence, because the recoveries made on 23-6-2011 have not been accepted. The omission to examine N andakumar is also inconsequential, given the sequence of reporting of the crime, and the rapidity of the events which developed after it. No doubt, Abhay Tiwari noticed the right shoe with a bullet hole, first; however, PW 20 was also with him; he deposed to the fact of its discovery and seizure. Similarly, the failure to examine Constable Dinesh is also not fatal, given the testimony of PW 29 and PW 30. 185. In Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra 58 , this Court held that even where a case hangs on the evidence of one eyewitness, it may be enough to sustain the conviction given sterling testimony of a competent, honest man although as a rule of prudence courts call for corroboration; it was observed that: (SCC p. 807, para 19) \"19. . . .

State of Bihar67 referred to previous decisions, and stated: (SCC p. 619, para 7) \"7. On a conspectus of these decisions, it clearly comes out that there has been no departure from the principles laid down in Vadivelu Thevar case68 and, therefore, conviction can be recorded on the basis of the statement of a single eyewitness provided his credibility is not shaken by any adverse circumstance appearing on the record against him and the court, at the same time, is convinced that he is a truthful witness.\" 187. Therefore, unless it is shown that the omission to examine a witness, who had previously participated during the investigation and whose statement was recorded by the police, undermines the prosecution case, or impacts on it significantly, the foundation of the fact or facts which are sought to be proved, remains unshaken as long as that fact is deposed to or spoken about by other witnesses, whose testimonies are to be seen in their own terms. Therefore, the omission to examine the individuals left out, but who the prosecution claimed, had participated during the investigation, did not affect its case, as far as the circumstances held to have been established by it, are concerned. Having dealt with the contentions of the accused, and also discussed circumstances that could be established (and what was not established) this Court proceeds to summarise its findings. 188. As against Neha, this Court has held that the circumstances proved are: 188.1. Firstly, recovery of articles including two golden bangles, a broken mangalsutra, 3 guriyas, a gold pendant, an ATM card which belonged to Megha on 22-6-2011. The loss of these articles was reported by PW 1, on 21-6-2011 i.e. one day before Neha's arrest. 188.2. The second circumstance proved by the prosecution is the TIP of these articles by PW 1 who was able to correctly identify them (as also corroborated by PW 12 during the trial). Linked with this circumstance is the deposition of PW 27, a Bank of India, Ujjain official who deposed to issuing a letter to the SHO, (Ext. P-98), containing the ATM card numbers. The ATM card (5264959108034023) which belonged to Megha, recovered on 22-6-2011 pursuant to Neha's disclosure statement, from her house, was issued by that bank. 188.3. The third circumstance proved by the prosecution against Neha is her fingerprint. PW 24 K.K. Dwivedi, the fingerprint expert, deposed to searching the crime scene for possibility of lifting impressions of fingerprints. A set of five fingerprints (i.e. Ext. P-80 chance fingerprints) were lifted by him which was witnessed by two witnesses (PW 5 and PW 9) who corroborated the fact. This Court has held, previously that the possibility of others' presence at the crime scene, and its contamination could be ruled out, because of the deposition of these two witnesses, as well as other depositions. PW 17 obtained the fingerprint samples of Neha (Ext. P-43), which he deposed to during 67 (1996) 1 sec 614: 1996 sec (Cri) 188 68 Vadivelu Thevar v.

The deficiencies alleged by the appellants, in the opinion of this Court, about the procedural lapses in the collection of such evidence , are not convincing. The evidence of PW 24, as well as his report (Ext. P-84) prove that a chance fingerprint (Sample E, collected from the crime scene) matched with the sample obtained from her, by PW 17 during the investigation. 188.4. The fourth circumstance, against Neha, which was established during the trial-and a vital one, is her knowledge of the crime. Her disclosure statement led to arrests of Rahul and Manoj, and recovery of stolen and other articles from their possession. The circumstances surrounding the manner of Neha's apprehension have been disbelieved by this Court, as well as the testimony of PW 10 and the TIP proceedings, during which he identified her. 189. As against Rahul, this Court has held that: 189.1. Firstly, the circumstances relating to his arrest (witnessed by PW 3 and PW 6), on 22-6-2011 were proved by the prosecution. 189.2. The second circumstance proved is that his disclosure statement led to recovery and seizure of stolen articles and other articles connected with the crime (Ext. P-14) , including two bent golden bangles, part of broken mangalsutra, a country-made pistol, a knife measuring 35.5 cm, and a photograph showing Rahul wearing black diamond-like beaded bracelet. 189.3. The third circumstance is that, like with Neha, PW 1 identified the gold jewellery recovered from Rahul's possession, during the TIP (further corroborated by PW 12). 189.4. The fourth circumstance proved is that PW 24 the fingerprint expert, depo sed that he found that Prints A and B lifted from the crime scene (as corroborated by PW 5 and PW 9) matched with the index and middle fingerprints, respectively of Rahul's right hand, in the sample (Ext. P-41) collected from him by PW 17. 189.5. The fifth circumstance proved during the trial is that Rahul had reported late in the evening of 19-6-2011, that he was shot on the right foot, by unknown persons. This was recorded in the form of a dehati nalisi against unknown persons; later an FIR (Ext. P-107) was registered by PW 30 for the offences punishable under Sections 294, 307 and 34 IPC. Rahul was initially taken to District Hospital (proved by the treatment card Ext. P-97 dated 19-6-2011). Rahul was however, referred to M.Y. Hospital, and examined by PW 32, who operated upon him. Ext. P-113 is the discharge card of M.Y. Hospital signed by PW 32 (who also deposed about it) on 20-6-2011. PW 29 who recorded the initial report dehati nalisi, also identified Rahul as the boy who had reported the incident. The bullet extracted from his foot was deposited (under memo Ext. P-113) in the Medico-Legal Cell of the hospital, and later seized (under memo E x t. P-108) on 23-6-2011. The FIR relating to this case was later closed. The other fact proved is the seizure of a right shoe (Ext. P-75) under jurisdiction of Annapurna PS (proved by PW 20), which the trial court observed had a bullet hole at the top. 189.6.

Three pieces of skin were found copper positive. Importantly, according to the report, two bullets, EB2 and EB 1 (recovered from the body of Megha, the deceased, and Rahul's right foot, respectively) were fired from pistol Ext. A-1 , seized from Rahul' s house. The report also stated that the gunshot fired at the seized right shoe (mentioned above) was caused by a copper-jacketed bullet. All this was proved by the ballistics report (Ext. P-120) that had analysed each of these items. The report also revealed that the ballistics expert (PW 16) had test fired from the pistol sent to FSL, and had found that the pistol had signs that the two spent cartridges, were fired from it. 190. As against Manoj, this Court has held several circumstances to have been proved: 190.1. The first circumstance proved against him, is his arrest and subseque nt disclosure statement, at 10.05 a.m. on 22-6-2011 (proved by PW 3 and PW 6). 190.2. The second circumstance is the recovery and seizure of articles, at Manoj' s behest, and from his possession, including - two golden bangles, portion of a broken mangalsutra, a knife and a photograph with Manoj in sunglasse s (Ext. P-17, also proved by same witnesses). 190.3. The third circumstance proved against Manoj is that PW 1 identified the golden jewellery recovered from his possession, during the TIP (corroborated by PW 12). 191. This Court is of the opinion that all the circumstances and the link connecting them, was sufficiently established by the prosecution and proved beyond reasonable doubt. Similarly, every hypothesis suggesting the innocence of the appellants is ruled out by such evidence , and the irresistible inference which follows, is their guilt. 192. In the opinion of this Court, the proof of the circumstances against the appellants clearly points to their guilt, and involvement in the crime. It appears that the appellants had informed themselves about the deceased and their movement. Perhaps they kept a watch over the area. Their common intention clearly was to rob the deceased, who had newly shifted to Indore and into the locality, on 19-6-2011. Though the exact time of occurrence is unknown, the post-mortem report reflected the duration of death within 12 to 36 hours from the time procedure started, which was after 11 a.m. on 20-6-2011. It is reasonable to infer, therefore, that death occurred sometime during the day, on 19-6-2011. Though the evidence of PW 10 has been disbelieved, the evidence of PW 5, PW 9 and PW 2, shows that the crime was noticed in the evening of 19-6-2011 when the bodies were discovered, and the police reached the scene. 193. The nature and description of the injuries on the deceased show that they had apparently put up a fight-which perhaps the appellants had not expected. The intention to rob the deceased, and coerce them into handing over their valuables, soon turned violent, due to the unexpected fight put up against the accused. There are several sharp-edged injuries, and one bullet injury which fatally wounded Megha. As a result, it is evident that to subdue ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The persistent resistance given by the deceased, coupled with the nature of injuries with sharp weapons (the two knives) were fatal to both Rohini and Ashlesha. The fact that the accused had to repeatedly stab them, reveals that the said appellants were not familiar with wielding such a weapon. Weapons (2 knives and 1 pistol) have specifically been recovered from the possession of Manoj and Rahul, and in these circumstances, their conviction for the offences with which they were charged, is justified. 194. Information as to how these attacks occurred within the house of the deceased and the distinct roles played by the accused, are in the special knowledge of only the accused; but no such information was forthcoming through the course of the trial or appellate stage. This Court69 has held that common intention requires prior meeting of mind, which can also be developed on the spur of the moment, provided there is premeditated concert. The circumstances reflect that there was a clear common intention among the three accused, to rob the house, and upon facing resistance - to complete the job and leave undetected, by all means necessary. 195. While no weapon has been recovered from Neha, it is clear that she was involved in the offences, and was present at the scene of the crime. This is evidenced by firstly, the fingerprint expert's testimony and report, which clearly reflects that her fingerprint was liftedfrom the crime scene; secondly, the recovery of stolen articles (gold jewellery, Megha's ATM card, etc.) from her possession; and thirdly, the fact that Manoj and Rahul are only arrested pursuant to her disclosure of their participation - all of which, cumulatively, clearly establish her involvement. The lack of an overt or specific act of violence attributable to Neha does not exonerate her, given that the prosecution has been able to prove her presence at the crime scene and participation in the commission of the offences, and that there was common object. 196. For the above reasons, all three accused are held guilty of the offences under Sections 397 /34, 449/34 and 302/34 IPC. Additionally, Manoj and Rahul's conviction under Section 25(1-B)(b) of the Arms Act, and Rahul's conviction under Section 27 of the Arms Act, is upheld. 197. Before proceeding to consideration of the question of sentence, this Court finds it necessary to briefly highlight the role of the Public Prosecutor and the trial court in a criminal trial, so as to safeguard the rights of the accused. The concealment of DW l 's role in this case's investigation (her analysing of call detail records of the deceased and in connection to Neha - which was not produced in trial; tip-off allegedly received regarding Neha's whereabouts and what she would be wearing; participating in Neha's arrest, and subsequent involvement on 23-6-2011 in recoveries of articles) points to concerning gaps in the manner of investigation carried out initially, or at the very least, an untruthful recollection and presentation of it, for the purposes of trial. As elaborated earlier, these facts prompted this Court to draw adverse inferences 69 Ramashish Yadav v.

Other circumstances have been proved sufficiently to conclude their guilt and result in conviction. a 198. However, it is appropriate to also point out that concealment ofDW 1 's role and failure to include the call detail records, could have severely prejudiced the accused, had these other circumstances not been made out. Therefore, at this juncture, it is pertinent to note and reiterate the role of the Public Prosecutor, and the trial court, in arriving at the truth by way of fair disclosure and scrutiny by inquiry, respectively. b 199. A Public Prosecutor (appointed under Section 24 CrPC) occupies a C d e f g h statutory office of high regard. Rather than a part of the investigating agency, they are instead, an independent statutory authority 70 who serve as officers to the court71 . The role of the Public Prosecutor is intrinsically dedicated to conducting a fair trial, and not for a \"thirst to reach the case in conviction\". This Court in Shiv Kumar v. Hukam Chand72 further held that: (SCC p. 472, para 13) \"13 . ... If an accused is entitled to any legitimate benefit during trial the Public Prosecutor should not scuttle/conceal it. On the contrary, it is the duty of the Public Prosecutor to winch it to the fore and make it available to the accused.\" 200. In Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi)73 (hereafter \"Manu Sharma\") it was concluded that: (SCC p. 74, para 187) \"J 87. Therefore, a Public Prosecutor has wider set of duties than to merely ensure that the accused is punished, the duties of ensuring fair play in the proceedings, all relevant facts are brought before the court in order for the determination of truth and justice for all the parties including the victims. It must be noted that these duties do not allow the Prosecutor to be lax in any of his duties as against the accused.\" 201. In Manu Sharma 73, the appellants in question had argued that the right to fair trial included a wide duty of disclosure on the Public Prosecutor, such that non-disclosure of any evidence - whether or not relied upon by the prosecution-must be made available to the defence. This Court considered Sections 207 and 208 CrPC, Rule 1674 of the Bar Council oflndia Rules (which is limited to evidence on which the Prosecutor proposes to rely on), and English 70 Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v.

The Common law position culled out was that subject to exceptions like sensitive information and public interest immunity, the prosecution should disclose any material which might be exculpatory to the defence . Such a a position, however, was not accepted by this Court, in its totality. It was held that such obligations are on a different footing in India, given the fundamental canons of our criminal jurisprudence founded on Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution, which require not just the investigating agency, but also courts in their own independent field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the individual's freedom, except in accordance with law i.e. ensure b adherence to the rule of law. 202. Relevant extracts that merit repetition are: (M anu Sharma case 73 , SCC pp. 80-81, paras 199 & 201-02) \"199 . It is not only the responsibility of the investigating agency but as well as that of the courts to ensure that investigation is fair and does not in any way hamper the freedom of an individual except in accordance with law. Equally enforceable canon of the criminal law is that the high responsibility lies upon the investigating agency not to conduct an inve stigation in tainted and unfair manner. The investigation should not prima facie be indicative of a biased mind and every effort should be made to bring the guilty to law as nobody stands above law dehors his position and influence in the society. * * * C d 201. Historically but consistently the view of this Court has been that an investigation must be fair and effective, must proceed in proper direction in consonance with the ingredients of the offence and not in haphazard manner. In some cases besides investigation being effective the e accused may have to prove miscarriage of justice but once it is shown the accused would be entitled to definite benefit in accordance with law. The investigation should be conducted in a manner so as to draw a just balance between citizen's right under Articles 19 and 21 and expansive power of the police to make investigation. These well-established principles have been stated by this Court in Sasi Thomas v. State 75 , State of T.N. v. Surya f Sankaram Karri76 and T.T. Antony v. State of Kerala77 . 202. In Nirmal Singh Kahlon v. State of Punjab 78 this Court specifically stated that a concept of fair investigation and fair trial are concomitant to preservation of the fundamental right of the accused under Article 21 of the Constitution oflndia. We have referred to this concept of judicious and fair investigation as the right of the accused to fair defence emerges from 9 this concept itself.

The scheme of the CrPC under Chapter XII (Information to Police and Powers to Investigate) is clear - the police have the power to investigate freely and fairly; in the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc. While the criminal court is empowered to summon these diaries under Section 172(2) for the purpose of inquiry or trial (and not as evidence), Section 173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely on it (to refresh their memory) or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police officers. 79 204. In Manu Sharma 73, in the context of police diaries, this Court noted that \"[t]he purpose and the object seems to be quite clear that there should be fairness in investigation, transparency and a record should be maintained to ensure a proper investigation\". This object is rendered entirely meaningless if the police fail to maintain the police diary accurately. Failure to meticulously note down the steps taken during investigation, and the resulting lack of transparency, undermines the accused's right to fair investigation; it is up to the trial court that must take an active role in scrutinising the record extensively, rather than accept the prosecution side willingly, so as to bare such hidden or concealed actions taken during the course of investigation. 80 205. In the present case, the trial court ought to have inquired more deeply into the role of DW 1, given that by her own deposition she had admitted to analysing call detail records and involvement in Neha's arrest - all of which had been suppressed by the prosecution side, for reasons best known to them. In this context, a reading of Sections 91 and 243 CrPC as done in M anu Sharma 73 , is important to refer to: (Manu Sharma case 7 3 , SCC p. 85, para 217) \"217 . ... Section 91 empowers the court to summon production of any document or thing which the court considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or another proceeding under the provisions of the Code. Where Section 91 read with Section 243 says that if the accused is called upon to enter his defence and produce his evidence there he has also been given the right to apply to the court for issuance of process for compelling the attendance of any witness for the purpose of examination, cross-examination or the production of any document or other thing for which the court has to pass a reasoned order.\" 79 Mukund Lal v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 450 SUPREME COURT CASES (2023) 2 sec 206. The Court went on to elaborate on the due process protection afforded to the accused, and its effect on fair disclosure responsibilities of the Public Prosecutor, as follows: (Manu Sharma case 73 , SCC pp. 85-87, paras 218-222) \"218. The liberty of an accused cannot be interfered with except under due process of law. The expression \"due process of law\" shall deem to include fairness in trial. The court (sic Code) gives a right to the accused to receive all documents and statements as well as to move an application for production of any record or witness in support of his case. This constitutional mandate and statutory rights given to the accused place an implied obligation upon the prosecution (prosecution and the Prosecutor) to make fair disclosure. The concept of fair disclosure would take in its ambit furnishing of a document which the prosecution relies upon whether filed in court or not. That document should essentially be furnished to the accused and even in the cases where during investigation a document is bona fide obtained by the investigating agency and in the opinion of the Prosecutor is relevant and would help in arriving at the truth, that document should also be disclosed to the accused. 219. The role and obligation of the Prosecutor particularly in relation to disclosure cannot be equated under our law to that prevalent under the English system as aforereferred to. But at the same time, the demand for a fair trial cannot be ignored. It may be of different consequences where a document which has been obtained suspiciously, fraudulently or by causing undue advantage to the accused during investigation such document could be denied in the discretion of the Prosecutor to the accused whether the prosecution relies or not upon such documents, however in other cases the obligation to disclose would be more certain. As already noticed the provisions of Section 207 have a material bearing on this subject and make an interesting reading. These provisions not only require or mandate that the court without delay and free of cost should furnish to the accused copies of the police report, first information report, statements, confessional statements of the persons recorded under Section 161 whom the prosecution wishes to examine as witnesses, of course, excluding any part of a statement or document as contemplated under Section 173(6) of the Code, any other document or relevant extract thereof which has been submitted to the Magistrate by the police under sub-section (5) of Section 173. In contradistinction to the provisions of Section 173, where the legislature has used the expression \"documents on which the prosecution relies\" are not used under Section 207 of the Code.

The right of the accused with regard to disclosure of documents is a limited right but is codified and is the very foundation of a fair investigation and trial. On such matters, the accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal right to claim every document of the police file or even the portions which are permitted to be excluded from the documents annexed to the report under Section 173(2) as per orders of the court. But certain rights of the accused flow both from the codified law as well as from equitable concepts of the constitutional jurisdiction, as substantial variation to such procedure would frustrate the very basis of a fair trial. To claim documents within the purview of scope of Sections 207, 243 read with the provisions of Section 173 in its entirety and power of the court under Section 91 of the Code to summon documents signifies and provides precepts which will govern the right of the accused to claim copies of the statement and documents which the prosecution has collected during investigation and upon which they rely. 221. It will be difficult for the Court to say that the accused has no right to claim copies of the documents or request the Court for production of a document which is part of the general diary subject to satisfying the basic ingredients of law stated therein. A document which has been obtained bonafide and has bearing on the case of the prosecution and in the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, the same should be disclosed to the accused in the interest of justice and fair investigation and trial should be furnished to the accused. Then that document should be disclosed to the accused giving him chance of fair defence, particularly when non-production or disclosure of such a document would affect administration of criminal justice and the defence of the accused prejudicially. 222. The concept of disclosure and duties of the Prosecutor under the English system cannot, in our opinion, be made applicable to the Indian criminal jurisprudence stricto sensu at this stage. However, we are of the considered view that the doctrine of disclosure would have to be given somewhat expanded application. As far as the present case is concerned, we have already noticed that no prejudice had been caused to the right of the accused to fair trial and non-furnishing of the copy of one of the ballistic reports had not hampered the ends of justice. Some shadow of doubt upon veracity of the document had also been created by the prosecution and the prosecution opted not to rely upon this document. In these circumstances, the right of the accused to disclosure has not received any setback in the facts and circumstances of the case. The accused even did not raise this issue seriously before the trial court.\" (emphasis supplied) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In this manner, the Public Prosecutor, and then the trial court's scrutiny, both play an essential role in safeguarding the accused's right to fair investigation, when faced with the might of the State's police machinery. 208. This view was endorsed in a recent three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Criminal Trials Guidelines Regarding Inadequacies & Deficiencies, In re v. State of A.P. 81 This Court has highlighted the inadequacy mentioned above, which would impede a fair trial, and inter alia, required the framing of rules by all States and High Courts, in this regard, compelling disclosure of a list containing mention of all materials seized and taken in, during investigation -to the accused. The relevant draft guideline, approved by this Court, for adoption by all States is as follows: (SCC p. 608, para 21) \"21 . ... ' ... 4. Supply of documents under Sections 173, 207 and 208 CrPC.-(1) Every accused shall be supplied with statements of witness recorded under Sections 161 and 164 CrPC and a list of documents, material objects and exhibits seized during investigation and relied upon by the investigating officer (10) in accordance with Sections 207 and 208 CrPC. Explanation: The list of statements, documents, material objects and exhibits shall specify statements, documents, material objects and exhibits that are not relied upon by the investigating officer.\" 209. In view of the above discussion, this Court holds that the prosecution, in the interests of fairness, should as a matter of rule, in all criminal trials, comply with the above rule, and furnish the list of statements, documents, material objects and exhibits which are not relied upon by the investigating officer. The presiding officers of courts in criminal trials shall ensure compliance with such rules. On sentence 210. The hearing of this case was adjourned for sentencing on a subsequent date, before which the learned counsel submitted material regarding the lives of the accused - both before the incident and post-conviction by the trial court, jail reports and other material called for by this Court were received from the State, and written submissions were filed by both sides. 211. In the course of arguments, the learned AAG maintained that there were no mitigating circumstances and the cruelty evident from the nature of the crime, warrants nothing less than the capital punishment, which according to her was correctly imposed, concurrently. It was submitted that it is in cases like the present one, where the \"rarest of rare\" doctrine needs to be invoked as a deterrent. 212. On the other hand the counsel for the accused laid emphasis on the fact that neither of the courts below had even considered the possibility of reform of the accused who were all of young age and barring Manoj (who had been involved in a petty offence in the past) the others did not have any criminal antecedents. The counsel also argued that an overall look at the circumstances, at best, could lead the Court to conclude that the extensive injuries inflicted 81 (2021) 10 sec 598: (2022) 1 sec (Cri) 100 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It was submitted besides that the potential of each convict to be reformed - both having regard to their previous backgrounds, as well as conduct in jail during pendency of trial and confirmation, was not considered. This amounted to an infraction of the rule in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab 82. 213. The counsel relied on numerous judgments relating to the importance of considering mitigating circumstances, the State's role in demonstrating the accused is beyond reformation, mitigating circumstances such as age and socio-economic background, pre-sentence hearing - its scope and the court's obligation, etc. 214. Capital punishment is prescribed in numerous IPC offences, including murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and injury causing death or leaving a woman in a vegetative state, rape or gang rape of a child below 12 years' old, dacoity with murder, among other offences. In Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab 82 (hereafter \"Bachan Singh\"), this Court had upheld the imposition of death penalty as an alternate punishment under Section 302 IPC on the strength of the 35th Report of the Law Commission of India (1967), the judgment in Jagmohan Singh v. State of U.P. 83 (which had also noted that the 35th Report advocated for retention) and in several subsequent cases decided by this Court, in which the death penalty was recognised to be a deterrent. It laid emphasis on the then recently added Sections 253(2) and 354(3) CrPC which provide for bifurcated pre-sentence hearing and sentencing procedure on conviction of capital offences, to conclude that this form of punishment continued to have legislative backing and thereby, represented the will of the people. 215. It is undeniable that there have been shifts in how punishment in capital offences are dealt with. This is apparent when developments are looked at holistically, or at a macrolevel: the amendments to the CrPC by Parliament, the 35th and 262nd Law Commission Reports which stand over 30 years apart, and the precedents of this Court, across the decades. Initially, the law imposed a requirement of written reasons for not imposing death penalty, which was removed in 1955. In 1973, through further amendment to the CrPC and insertion of Section 354(3) - life imprisonment became the norm and imposition of death penalty required \"special reasons\"; and through Section 253(2) - sentencing required separate consideration from the question of conviction. In both phases i.e. post-1955 and post-1973, capital punishment was upheld to be constitutional by five-Judge Benches of this Court in Jagmohan Singh 83 and Bachan Singh 82 , respectively. 216. The 262nd Law Commission Report on Death Penalty (2015) (hereafter \"the 262nd Report\"), is a result of this Court's references in primarily two cases. Firstly, in Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra'84 (hereafter \"Santosh Bariyar\") where, after taking note 82 (1980) 2 sec 684: 1980 sec (Cri) 580 83 (1973) 1 sec 20: 1973 sec (Cri) 169 84 (2009) 6 sec 498, para 112 : (2009) 2 sec (Cri) 1150 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Secondly, the judgment in Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra 86 tasked the Law Commission to resolve the issue of whether death penalty is a deterrent punishment, is retributive justice, or serves an incapacitative goal; and to study the difference in approach adopted by the judiciary (rarest of rare) and the executive (what was termed as unknown) while granting commutation. In attempting to fulfil this mandate, the Commission discerned an urgent need for re-examination of its own earlier recommendations on the death penalty (in its 35th Report, 1967), given the drastic change in social, economic, and cultural contexts of the country since the 35th Report, and arbitrariness which has remained a major concern in the adjudication of death penalty cases since Bachan Singh 82 laid down the foundational principle of \"rarest of rare\". 217. Reflective of changed circumstances and evolving discourse, the Report marks a shift in the approach towards the death penalty in India, going so far as to recommend abolition in all offences, except those relating to terrorism. A large part of the Report focusses on courts' discretion and judicial reasoning when it comes to sentencing. It concludes that death penalty sentencing in India has been based on an arbitrary application of the Bachan Singh 82 principle, and has become Judge-centric, based on the personal predilection of Judges - a concern which was alluded to even by this Court in Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka 87 and analysed extensively again in Santosh Bariyar84 , followed by Sangeet v. State of Haryana 88 , Mohd. Farooq Abdul Gafur v.

This Court in Bachan Singh 82 while upholding the constitutionality of capital punishment, categorically ruled that the new CrPC of 1973 marked a shift as it bifurcated the criminal trial to include a pre-sentence hearing [under Section 235(2)], and further mandated the sentencing court to outline a b C d e the \"special reasons\" [under Section 354(3)] or absence of them, by considering f circumstances both of the crime and the criminal. The Court also noted that while broad guidelines or indicators may be given, they cannot be put into water-tight compartments that curb discretion of any Judge to do justice in a given individual case: (SCC pp. 739 & 748, paras 163 & 201) 85 Adopted on 18-12-2007. 86 (2013) 5 SCC 546, paras 148-149: (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 402 82 Bachan Singh v.

Now, Section 235(2) provides for a bifurcated trial and specifically gives the accused person a right of pre-sentence hearing, at a which stage, he can bring on record material or evidence, which may not be strictly relevant to or connected with the particular crime under inquiry, but nevertheless, have, consistently with the policy underlined in Section 354(3), a bearing on the choice of sentence. The present legislative policy discernible from Section 235(2) read with Section 354(3) is that in fixing the degree of punishment or making the choice of sentence for b various offences, including one under Section 302 of the Penal Code, the court should not confine its consideration \"principally\" or merely to the circumstances connected with the particular crime, but also give due consideration to the circumstances of the criminal. C d e f g h * * * 201 . ... As we read Sections 354(3) and 235(2) and other related provisions of the 1973 Code, it is quite clear to us that for making the choice of punishment or for ascertaining the existence or absence of \"special reasons\" in that context, the court must pay due regard both to the crime and the criminal. What is the relative weight to be given to the aggravating and mitigating factors, depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. More often than not, these two aspects are so intertwined that it is difficult to give a separate treatment to each of them. This is so because \"style is the man\" . In many cases , the extremely cruel or beastly manner of the commission of murder is itself a demonstrated index of the depraved character of the perpetrator. That is why, it is not desirable to consider the circumstances of the crime and the circumstances of the criminal in two separate watertight compartments. In a sense, to kill is to be cruel and therefore all murders are cruel. But such cruelty may vary in its degree of culpability. And it is only when the culpability assumes the proportion of extreme depravity that \"special reasons\" can legitimately be said to exist.\" (emphasis in original) 219. The Court also accepted a list of helpful factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 82 However, cautioning the court from treating them to be exhaustive, the Court further clarified that they were merely indicative and that the mitigating circumstances had to be read in a \"liberal and expansive\" manner, accounting for the dignity of human life: (Bachan Singh 82 , SCC p. 751, para 209) \"209. There are numerous other circumstances justifying the passing of the lighter sentence; as there are countervailing circumstances of aggravation. 'We cannot obviously feed into a judicial computer all such situations since they are astrological imponderables in an imperfect and undulating society.' Nonetheless, it cannot be over-emphasised that the scope and concept of mitigating factors in the area of death penalty must receive a liberal and expansive construction by the courts in accord with 82 Bachan Singh v.

Hanging of murderers has never been too good for them. Facts and figures, albeit incomplete, furnished by the Union oflndia, show that in a the past, courts have inflicted the extreme penalty with extreme infrequency - a fact which attests to the caution and compassion which they have always brought to bear on the exercise of their sentencing discretion in so grave a matter. It is, therefore, imperative to voice the concern that courts, aided by the broad illustrative guidelines indicated by us, will discharge the onerous function with evermore scrupulous care and humane concern, b directed along the highroad of legislative policy outlined in Section 354(3) viz. that for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception. A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law ' s instrumentality. That ought not to be done save in the rarest o f rare cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed.\" c 220. In Machhi Sing h 91 , this Court extrapolated the principles from Bachan Singh 82 , and merit repetition: (Machhi Singh case91 , SCC p. 489, paras 38-40) \"38. In this background the guidelines indicated in Bachan Singh case 82 will have to be culled out and applied to the facts of each individual case where the question of imposing of death sentence arises. d The following propositions emerge from Bachan Singh case 82 : (i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability. (ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the \"offender\" also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the \"crime\". e (iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and f circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances. (iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised. g 39.

(b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender? 40. If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances in the light of the aforesaid proposition and taking into account the answers to the questions posed hereinabove, the circumstances of the case are such that death sentence is warranted, the court would proceed to do so.\" 221. InMachhi Singh 91 , this Court also attempted to categorise cases under broadly five heads (i.e. manner of commission of murder, motive, anti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime, magnitude of crime, and personality of victim), by strongly analysing the aggravating circumstances of the crime. A formalistic reliance on these categories however, has the potential of leading any court awry as it has the unintended effect of drawing attention away from the criminal, and focussing disproportionately on the crime - the dangers of this standardisation was also noted by this Court in Swamy Shraddananda (2) 87 , Sangeet88 and more recently in Sanjiv Khanna, J. 's dissenting opinion in Manoharan v. State92 . 222. This Court in Bachan Singh 82 had warned against categorising cases. 93 Rejecting the contention that standards and guidelines should be laid down, it was noted in Bachan Singh 82 that degree of culpability cannot be measured, and aggravating and mitigating circumstances could not be rigidly enumerated so as to exclude \"all free play of discretion\". Reiterating that criminal cases cannot be categorised as there were infinite, unpredictable and unforeseen variations, it was held that by such categorisation, the sentencing process would cease to be judicial, and such standardisation or sentencing discretion is beyond the court's function. Therefore, it would be befitting if reliance were placed not solely on those five categories of crimes (which lays undue emphasis on aggravating circumstances) enumerated inMachhi Singh 91 , and instead on the two-question test, and the four guiding principles of Bachan Singh 82 that were succinctly culled out in Machhi Singh9 1. 223. The decades that followed, have witnessed a line of judgments in which this Court has continually taken judicial notice of the incongruence in application of the \"rarest of rare\" test enunciated in Bachan Singh 82 , and therefore, tried to restrict imposition of the death penalty, in an attempt to strengthen a principled application of the same. 91 Machhi Singh v.

This aspect was dealt with extensively in Santosh Bariyar84 where the Court articulated the test to be a two-step process to determine whether a case deserves the death sentence - firstly, that the case belongs to the \"rarest of rare\" category, and secondly, that the option of life imprisonment would simply not suffice. For the first step, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have to be identified and considered equally. For the second test, the court had to consider whether the alternative of life imprisonment was unquestionably foreclosed as the sentencing aim of reformation was unachievable, for which the State must provide material. 225. About four years later, in Sangeet88 , this Court lamented the continuing lack of attention given to circumstances of the criminal, reiterated that balancing of aggravating-mitigating circumstances and failure to apply the Bachan Singh 82 sentencing framework uniformly, was leading to Judge-centric and inconsistent jurisprudence in death penalty matters. 226. In Shankar Kisanrao Khade 86 this Court developed yet another framework of the \"crime test\", criminal test\" and \"rarest of rare test\" (which was held to be distinct from the \"balance test\" that was discouraged in Santosh Bariyar84 and subsequently, in Sangeet88 as well): (Shankar Kisanrao Khade case 86 , sec p. 576, para 52) \"52 . ... In my considered view, the tests that we have to apply, while awarding death sentence are \"crime test\", \"criminal test\" and the \"R-R test\" and not the \"balancing test\". To award death sentence, the \"crime test\" has to be fully satisfied, that is, 100% and \"criminal test\" 0%, that is, no mitigating circumstance favouring the accused. If there is any circumstance favouring the accused, like lack of intention to commit the crime, possibility of reformation, young age of the accused, not a menace to the society, no previous track record, etc. the \"criminal test\" may favour the accused to avoid the capital punishment. Even if both the tests are satisfied, that is, the aggravating circumstances to the fullest extent and no mitigating circumstances favouring the accused, still we have to apply finally the rarest of the rare case test (R-R test). R-R test depends upon the perception of the society that is \"society-centric\" and not \"Judge-centric\", that is, whether the society will approve the awarding of death sentence to certain types of crimes or not. While applying that test, the court has to look into variety of factors like society's abhorrence, extreme indignation and antipathy to certain types of crimes like sexual assault and murder of intellectually challenged minor girls, suffering from physical disability, old and infirm women with those disabilities, etc. Examples are only illustrative and not exhaustive.

Recently, while considering a review petition, this Court in Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra 94 held that Bachan Singh 82 had intended the test to be \"probability\" and not improbability, possibility or impossibility of reformation and rehabilitation as a mandate of Section 354( 4) CrPC. 94 The Court analysed numerous earlier precedents, noting that evidence by the State on this has been sparse and limited, but was essential for the courts to measure the probability of reform, rehabilitation and reintegration. The Court located this requirement in the right of the accused, who regardless of being ruthless, was entitled to a life of dignity, notwithstanding his crime. 95 While this process is not easy, it was noted that neither is the process of rehabilitation since it involves reintegration into society. When this is found to be not possible in certain cases, a longer duration of imprisonment was instead permissible. Uneven application of this framework and (in) consistency in sentencing 228. An overall analysis of capital punishment cases decided by this Court will perhaps reflect that that there is in fact, no pattern. While there are real and valid concerns in the non-uniform application of the Bachan Singh 82 framework, discretion in sentencing, in itself - is not worrisome, and the concern needs to be dispelled. While generally Judges may look to precedents for the comfort of numbers, that process only gives an indication of how similar instances have been dealt with and has a limited role when it comes to sentencing. The discretion afforded to the court in sentencing, is not for it to be Judge-centric or result in disparate rulings, but in fact to enable the court with the flexibility of considering the case-specific factors relating to the crime and criminal, without falling into predetermined patterns. Sentencing is not a mathematical equation and ought not be seen as one. This has been recognised in numerous cases starting from Bachan Singh 82 itself. 229. In Santosh Bariyar84 , analysing the equality principle, due process and proportionality requirement in capital sentencing, it was held that rather than applying strict classification of the type of offences that warrant death sentence, the court must focus on equally considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstances (in which commonality is to be drawn across case), and arrive at individualised sentencing outcomes on a case-to-case basis. 84 It was noted: (Santosh Bariyar case 84, SCC p. 550, paras 132-33) \"132. . . . The imprecision of the identification of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be minimised.

The aggravating and mitigating circumstances have to be separately identified under a rigorous measure. 133. Bachan Singh 82 when mandates principled precedent-based sentencing, compels careful scrutiny of mitigating circumstances and aggravating circumstances and then factoring in a process by which aggravating and mitigating circumstances appearing from the pool of comparable cases can be compared. The weight which is accorded by the court to particular aggravating and mitigating circumstances may vary from case to case in the name of individualised sentencing, but at the same time reasons for apportionment of weights shall be forthcoming. Such a comparison may point out excessiveness as also will help repel arbitrariness objections in future. A sentencing hearing, comparative review of cases and similarly aggravating and mitigating circumstances analysis can only be given a go-by if the sentencing court opts for life imprisonment.\" (emphasis supplied) 230. The strength of \"precedent\" and \"consistency\" is perhaps, therefore, lowest when it comes to matters of sentencing, as long as it is within the confines of legality and resulting in \"principled sentencing\". In other words, the judicial incongruence when it relates to sentencing, would in fact be a positive indicator, rather than a negative one, provided it is still within the well- defined contours of \"principled\" sentencing. For sentencing in capital offences, discretion to arrive at individualised sentences is encouraged, but must be constrained by the \"rarest of rare\" principle, wherein the court considers aggravating circumstances of the crime, and mitigating circumstances of the criminal (a \"liberal and expansive\" construction of the latter), which in turn must inform their consideration of whether the option of life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed owing to an impossibility96 to reform. 231. Deviation from this principle i.e. unguided discretion on the other hand, would quite obviously lead to bad law. For instance, Ravji v. State of Rajasthan 97 (hereafter \"Ravji\"), in complete contravention of this Court's earlier Constitution Bench decision of Bachan Singh 82 (which focussed on both the crime, and criminal), held that \" ... It is the nature and gravity of the crime but not the criminal, which are germane for consideration of appropriate punishment in a criminal trial\". A line of cases98 , further relied on this (in this Court's considered opinion, incorrect) decision in Ravji case97 , and concluded that the nature and gravity of the crime (i.e. its brutality or heinousness), were sufficient to impose capital punishment, without considering mitigating 82 Bachan Singh v.

Subsequently, the decision in Ravji97 was- quite correctly-declared to be per incuriam by another Bench of this Court in Santosh Bariyar&tt, for non-consideration of circumstances of the criminal. Other cases that have focussed on brutality of the crime, as negating or washing away the need to consider mitigating circumstances, similarly serve as bad precedent. 232. This Court in Rajesh Kumar v. State 99 again reiterated that brutality in itself, was not enough to impose death sentence - the accused was convicted for murder of two children who offered no provocation or resistance to the brutal and inhuman fashion in which the accused committed the crime, however, it was held that due consideration to the mitigating circumstances of the criminal still had to be given. Evidence had to be placed on record by the State, demonstrating that he was beyond reform or rehabilitation, the absence of which was a mitigating circumstance in itself. The High Court had merely noted that he was a first-time offender and had a family to take care of - which this Court noted was a very narrow and myopic view on the mitigating circumstances. 233. Therefore, \"individualised, principled sentencing\" - based on both the crime and criminal, with consideration of whether reform or rehabilitation is achievable (held to be \"probable\" in Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik94 ), and consequently whether the option of life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed - should be the only factor of \"commonality\" that must be discernible from decisions relating to capital offences. With the creation of a new sentencing threshold in Swamy Shraddananda (2) 87 , and later affirmed by a Constitution Bench in Union of India v. V. Sriharan 100 , of life imprisonment without statutory remission (i.e. Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution are still applicable), yet another option exists, before imposition of death sentence. However, serious concern has been raised against this concept, as it was upheld by a narrow majority, and is left to be considered at an appropriate time. Theories of punishment 234. The 262nd Report speaks extensively to the penological justification of the death penalty. It finds that there is inconclusive evidence that this form of punishment has more of a deterrent effect, in comparison to life imprisonment. Dismissing the retributive theory of punishment on the ground that it suffers from lack of guidance on quantifying the punishment that would be appropriate to impose, it categorically states that: \"7.1.2. Capital punishment fails to achieve any constitutionally valid penological goals. 97 Ravji v. State of Rajasthan, (1996) 2 SCC 175 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 225 84 Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v.

Reliance on the death penalty diverts attention from other problems ailing the criminal justice system such as poor investigation, crime prevention and rights of victims of crime.\" 235. While the 262nd Report recommends abolition of the death penalty on this ground, in addition to sentencing having become Judge-centric or arbitrary, it has not prompted parliamentary intervention. Whether the death penalty deserves a relook [as recommended by Kurian Joseph, J. (dissenting) in Chhannu Lal Verma 90 ], in light of the 262nd Law Commission Report, evolving jurisprudence, public discourse and international standards of human rights, is outside the purview of this Court's jurisdiction given the Constitution Bench decision in Bachan Singh 82 , and a question best left for the legislature to critically consider. In this backdrop, what this Court can do , is try and bolster the existing sentencing framework. This is possible only by giving true meaning to the existing guidelines (without falling into the trap of \"categorising\" crimes that automatically warrant death penalty). To do so, this Court finds it necessary to lay out certain practical guidelines (elaborated below) that can facilitate consideration of mitigating circumstances as recognised in Bachan Singh 82 , and consequently ensure uniform application of this framework. 236. The 262nd Report recognised the paradigm shift, in policy and discourse, towards a reformative and rehabilitative response to crime , and the development of jurisprudence such that adjudging a case to be \"rarest of rare\" was not sufficient, and special emphasis had to be placed in considering whether the offender is amenable to reform. Implicit in this shift is the understanding that the criminal is not a product of only their own decisions, but also a product of the State and society's failing, which is what entitles the accused to a chance of reformation. Thus, making life imprisonment the norm, and death penalty the exception. In Lehna v. State of Haryana 101 while deciding whether the facts in that case were appropriate for death penalty, traced this shift in approach: (SCC pp. 83-84, para 14) \"14 . ... Section 302 IPC prescribes death or life imprisonment as the penalty for murder. While doing so, the Code instructs the court as to its application. The changes which the Code has undergone in the last three decades clearly indicate that Parliament is taking note of contemporary criminological thought and movement. It is not difficult to discern that in the Code, there is a definite swing towards life imprisonment. Death sentence is ordinarily ruled out and can only be imposed for \"special reasons\", as provided in Section 354(3). There is another provision in the Code which also uses the significant expression \"special reason\". It is Section 361. Section 360 of the 1973 Code re-enacts, in substance, Section 562 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (in short \"the old 90 Chhannu Lal Venna v. State ofChhattisgarh, (2019) 12 SCC 438: (2019) 4 SCC (Cri) 402 82 Bachan Singh v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h MANOI v. STATE OF M.P. (Ravindra Bhat, J.) 463 Code\"). Section 361 which is a new provision in the Code makes it mandatory for the court to record \"special reasons\" for not applying the provisions of Section 360. Section 361 thus casts a duty upon the court to apply the provisions of Section 360 wherever it is possible to do so and to state \"special reasons\" if it does not do so. In the context of Section 360, the \"special reasons\" contemplated by Section 361 must be such as to compel the court to hold that it is impossible to reform and rehabilitate the offender after examining the matter with due regard to the age, character and antecedents of the offender and the circumstances in which the offence was committed. This is some indication by the legislature that reformation and rehabilitation of offenders and not mere deterrence, are now among the foremost objects of the administration of criminal justice in our country. Section 361 and Section 354(3) have both entered the statute book at the same time and they are part of the emerging picture of acceptance by the legislature of the new trends in criminology. It would not, therefore, be wrong to assume that the personality of the offender as revealed by his age, character, antecedents and other circumstances and the tractability of the offender to reform must necessarily play the most prominent role in determining the sentence to be awarded. Special reasons must have some relation to these factors. Criminal justice deals with complex human problems and diverse human beings. A Judge has to balance the personality of the offender with the circumstances, situations and the reactions and choose the appropriate sentence to be imposed.\" (emphasis supplied) 237. Mitigating factors in general, rather than excuse or validate the crime committed, seek to explain the surrounding circumstances of the criminal to enable the Judge to decide between the death penalty or life imprisonment. An illustrative list of indicators first recognised in Bachan Singh 82 itself: (SCC p. 750, para 206) \"206 . ... Mitigating circumstances.-In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases, the court shall take into account the following circumstances: (1) That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance. (2) The age of the accused. If the accused is young or old, he shall not be sentenced to death. (3) The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society. ( 4) The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated. The State shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy Conditions (3) and (4) above. 82 Bachan Singh v.

(6) That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another person. (7) That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective and that the said defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.\" These are hardly exhaustive; subsequently, this Court in several judgments has recognised, and considered commutation to life imprisonment, on grounds such as young age 1°2 , socio-economic conditions 103 , mental illness 1°4 , criminal antecedents 105 , as relevant indicators on the questions of sentence. Many of these factors reflect demonstrable ability or merely the possibility even, of the accused to reform [i.e. (3) and (4) of the Bachan Singh 82 list], which make them important indicators when it comes to sentencing. Pre-sentence hearing - Opportunity and obligation to provide material on the accused 238. This Court in Bachan Singh 82 held that the introduction of pre- sentencing hearing to the accused in 1973 through Section 235(2) CrPC altered the Jagmohan Singh 83 principle that the court is primarily concerned with the circumstances connected with crime. Therefore, now due consideration has to be given to the circumstances of the criminal as well, when adjudicating whether the case falls within \"rarest of rare\" and if the option of life imprisonment as an alternative, is unquestionably foreclosed. In Bachan Singh 82 , this Court categorically stated that, \"[t]he probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to the society\", is a relevant circumstance, that must be given great weight in the determination of sentence. 239. The sentencing hearing contemplated under Section 235(2), is not confined merely to oral hearing but intended to afford a real opportunity to the prosecution as well as the accused, to place on record facts and material relating to various factors on the question of sentence and if interested by either side, to have evidence adduced to show mitigating circumstances to impose a lesser sentence or aggravating grounds to impose death penalty. 106 102 Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde v.

In the absence of an individual's capacity to effectively bring forth mitigating factors, this Court in Bachan Singh 82 placed the burden of eliciting a mitigating circumstances on the court, which has to consider them liberally and expansively, whereas the responsibility of providing material to show that the accused is beyond the scope of reform or rehabilitation, thereby unquestionably foreclosing the option of life imprisonment and making it a fit case for imposition of death penalty, is one which falls squarely on the State. This has been reiterated and further spelt out by this Court in Santosh Bariyar84, b Rajesh Kumar99 , Chhannu Lal Verma 90 , and other decisions 107. C d e f g h 241. In Santosh Bariyar84 , making observations on nature of information to be collected at the pre-sentencing stage, this Court further observed that: (SCC p. 527, para 56) \"56. At this stage, Bachan Singh 82 informs the content of the sentencing hearing. The court must play a proactive role to record all relevant information at this stage. Some of the information relating to crime can be culled out from the phase prior to sentencing hearing. This information would include aspects relating to the nature, motive and impact of crime, culpability of convict, etc. Quality of evidence adduced is also a relevant factor. For instance, extent of reliance on circumstantial evidence or child witness plays an important role in the sentencing analysis. But what is sorely lacking, in most capital sentencing cases, is information relating to characteristics and socio-economic background of the offender. This issue was also raised in the 48th Report of the Law Commission.\" (emphasis supplied) 242. The State's duty is heightened in importance even more so, in the Indian context where a majority of the accused have a poor or rudimentary level of legal representation. The importance of collecting socio-economic factors in the context of our criminal justice system was critically noted by the 262nd Report as follows: \"7.1.6. Numerous committee reports as well as judgments of the Supreme Court have recognised that the administration of criminal justice in the country is in deep crisis. Lack of resources, outdated modes of investigation, over-stretched police force, ineffective prosecution, and poor legal aid are some of the problems besetting the system. Death penalty operates within this context and therefore suffers from the same structural and systemic impediments. The administration of capital punishment thus remains fallible and vulnerable to misapplication. The vagaries of the system also operate disproportionately against the socially and 82 Bachan Singh v.

However, despite over four decades since Bachan Singh 82 there has been little to no policy-driven change, towards formulating a scheme or system that elaborates how mitigating circumstances are to be collected, for the court's consideration. Scarce information about the accused at the time of sentencing, severely disadvantages the process of considering mitigating circumstances. It is clarified that mere mention of these circumstances by the counsel, serves no purpose - rather, they must be connected to the possibility of reformation and assist principled judicial reasoning [as required under Section 235(2) CrPC]. Constrained by this lack of assistance, this Court (as mentioned above) in Rajesh Kumar99 has even gone so far as to hold that the very fact that the State had not given any evidence to show that the convict was beyond reform and rehabilitation was a mitigating circumstance, in itself. 244. The lack of forthcoming information has led to attempts by the courts, to look backwards-sometimes many years after the crime has been committed -to evaluate on the one hand, circumstances that could not have been paused in time, and on the other those which can be captured, but for which there exists no frame of reference from the past, for comparison. This inconsistency in some courts calling for reports, while others fail to - further contributes to our patchwork jurisprudence on capital sentencing, and in turn undermines the equality principle and due process protection that Santosh Bariyar84 recognises as existing, in favour of death row convicts. 245. The move to call for a Probation Officer's Report 108 (as done by this Court even in this case), is in fact a desperate attempt by the courts at the appellate stage, to obtain information on the accused - at present. Good conduct of the accused at the post-conviction stage in prison (through a jail report), and psychiatric evaluation to evaluate possibility of reform (albeit at the appellate sentencing stage), were considered recently in Chhannu Lal Verma 90 as necessary indicators for considering mitigating circumstances: (SCC pp. 451-52, paras 15-16) \"15 . ... Since the appellant has been in jail, we wanted to know whether there was any attempt on his part for reformation. The Superintendent of the jail has given a certificate that his conduct in jail has been good. Thus, there is a clear indication that despite having lost all hope, yet no frustration has set on the appellant. On the contrary, there was a conscious effort on his part to lead a good life for the remaining period. A convict is sent to jail with the hope and expectation that he would make amends and get reformed. 82 Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684: 1980 SCC (Cri) 580 99 Rajesh Kumar v.

The conduct of the convict in prison cannot be lost sight of The fact that the prisoner has displayed good behaviour in prison certainly goes on to show that he is not beyond reform. 16. Jn the matter of probability and possibility of reform of a criminal, we do not find that a proper psychological/psychiatric evaluation is done. Without the assistance of such a psychological/psychiatric assessment and evaluation it would not be proper to hold that there is no possibility or probability of reform. The State has to bear in mind this important aspect while proving by evidence that the convict cannot be reformed or rehabilitated.\" (emphasis supplied) 246. However, this too, is too little, too late and only offers a peek into the circumstances of the accused after conviction. The unfortunate reality is that in the absence of well-documented mitigating circumstances at the trial level, the aggravating circumstances seem far more compelling, or overwhelming, rendering the sentencing court prone to imposing the death penalty, on the basis of an incomplete, and hence, incorrect application of the Bachan Singh 82 test. 247. The goal ofreformation is ideal, and what society must strive towards - there are many references to it peppered in this Court's jurisprudence across the decades - but what is lacking is a concrete framework that can measure and evaluate it. Unfortunately, this is mirrored by the failure to implement prison reforms of a meaningful kind, which has left the process of incarceration and prisons in general, to be a space of limited potential for systemic reformation. The goal of reformative punishment requires systems that actively enable reformation and rehabilitation, as a result of nuanced policy-making. As a small step to correct these skewed results and facilitate better evaluation of whether there is a possibility for the accused to be reformed (beyond vague references to conduct, family background, etc.), this Court deems it necessary to frame practical guidelines for the courts to adopt and implement, till the legislature and executive, formulate a coherent framework through legislation. These guidelines may also offer guidance or ideas, that such a legislative framework could benefit from, to systematically collect and evaluate information on mitigating circumstances. Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances 248.

To do this, the trial court must elicit information from the accused and the State, both. The State, must-for an offence carrying capital punishment -at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused. This will help establish proximity (in terms of timeline), to the accused person's frame of mind (or mental illness, if any) at the time of committing the crime and offer guidance on mitigating factors (1 ), (5), (6) and (7) spelled out in Bachan Singh 82 . Even for the other factors of (3) and ( 4 )-an onus placed squarely on the Slate-conducting this form of psychiatric and psychological evaluation close on the heels of commission of the offence, will provide a baseline for the appellate courts to use for comparison i.e. to evaluate the progress of the accused towards reformation, achieved during the incarceration period. 250. Next, the State, must in a time-bound manner, collect additional information pertaining to the accused. An illustrative, but not exhaustive list is as follows: (a) Age (b) Early family background (siblings, protection of parents, any history of violence or neglect) (c) Present family background (surviving family members, whether married, has children, etc.) (d) Type and level of education (e) Socio-economic background (including conditions of poverty or deprivation, if any) (f) Criminal antecedents (details of offence and whether convicted, sentence served, if any) (g) Income and the kind of employment (whether none, or temporary or permanent, etc.); (h) Other factors such as history of unstable social behaviour, or mental or psychological ailment(s), alienation of the individual (with reasons, if any), etc. This information should mandatorily be available to the trial court, at the sentencing stage. The accused too, should be given the same opportunity to produce evidence in rebuttal, towards establishing all mitigating circumstances. 251. Lastly, information regarding the accused's jail conduct and behaviour, work done (if any), activitie s the accuse d has involved themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities (i.e. Probation and Welfare O fficer, Superintendent of Jail, etc.).

(Ravindra Bhat, J.) 469 fresh report (rather than the one used by the previous court) from the jail authorities is recommended, for a more exact and complete understanding of the contemporaneous progress made by the accused, in the time elapsed. The jail authorities must also include a fresh psychiatric and psychological report which will further evidence the reformative progress, and reveal post- conviction mental illness, if any. 252. It is pertinent to point out that this Court in Anil v. State of Maharashtra 52 has in fact directed criminal courts to call for additional material: (SCC p. 86, para 33) \"33. . . . Many a times, while determining the sentence, the courts take it for granted, looking into the facts of a particular case, that the accused would be a menace to the society and there is no possibility of reformation and rehabilitation, while it is the duty of the court to ascertain those factors, and the State is obliged to furnish materials for and against the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of the accused. The facts, which the courts deal with, in a given case, cannot be the foundation for reaching such a conclusion, which, as already stated, calls for additional materials. We, therefore, direct that the criminal courts, while dealing with the offences like Section 302 IPC, after conviction, may, in appropriate cases, call for a report to determine, whether the accused could be reformed or rehabilitated, which depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\" (emphasis supplied) We hereby fully endorse and direct that this should be implemented uniformly, as further elaborated above, for conviction of offences that carry the possibility of death sentence . Sentencing of present accused 253. This Court is of the opinion, that there can be no doubt that the crime committed by the three accused was brutal, and grotesque. The three defenceless victims were women of different age groups (22, 46, 76 years) who were caught off-guard and severely physically assaulted, resulting in their death, in the safety and comfort of their own home. To have killed three generations of women from the family of PW 1, is without a doubt, grotesque. The manner of the offence was also vicious and pitiless - Ashlesha and Rohini, were stabbed repeatedly to their death, while Megha was shot point blank in the face. The post-mortem (Ext. P-44) reflects that the stab wounds were extensive - ranging across the bodies of the victim. The extensive bleeding at the crime scene further reflects cruel and inhumane manner of attack, against the three women. The crime in itself, could no doubt be characterised as \"extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community\" as defined in M achhi Singh 91 .

On an application of the Bachan Singh 82 test (as clarified and explained, in numerous decisions elaborated above), however, the mitigating circumstances need to be considered (and that too, liberally and expansively). a Prior to the hearing on sentencing before this Court, a direction was issued to the State to ( on the basis of personal interviews and prison records) file for each of the accused - a Psychological Evaluation Report, a Probation Officer's Report, and Prison Report including material on their conduct and work done. Furthermore , each of the accused has placed material on record before this Court, to demonstrate circumstances of the criminal. b 255. Given that in this case there are three accused - this Court cannot baldly consider their circumstances collectively, and instead find that an individualised approach is necessary. (i) Manoj 256. The material states that Manoj' s conduct appears to be disciplined, correctional in nature and overall satisfactory, barring one physical altercation during an earlier confinement period. He has a wife and two young children with whom he has repaired relations and is regularly in touch with. He makes special effort to be a part of his growing children's lives, demonstrating strong continued family ties. While in prison, owing to his interest in cricket, he has also taken up the responsibility of being the Captain of the Jail Block team. The Probation Officer concludes that he seems remorseful, and keen to reintegrate into society with his family. (ii) Rahul 257. The report received from the Superintendent of Jail indicates that he too was involved in an altercation with another inmate in his previous confinement period, but his overall conduct appears to be normal, and correctional in nature. He has been voluntarily working as a health worker (based on his request) since 5-1-2021 wherein he helps transport sick inmates to the Jail Hospital. While in prison, he has completed 12th standard education, and proceeded to pursue BCom from IGNOU, New Delhi (in his final year). He actively participates in cultural and spiritual programmes conducted in the prison. His family consists of his ailing father, mother, and three married sisters. He expressed concern for his old parents and wished to help them financially by rejoining society. (iii) Neha C d e f 258. Her prison record reflects that she had, on a few occasions, got into fights and exchanged abuses with the other female inmates, and lady guard g officers in the jail. After counselling, however, her conduct has improved and was found to be disciplined and corrective in nature. While in prison, she actively participates in cultural programmes, has undergone training for embroidery, knitting and lamination.

Before detention, she was pursuing her BCom degree, which she completed in prison. Her family consists of her parents and two married brothers (of which one, is paralysed), who she is regularly in touch with. Conclusion on sentence of the three accused 259. It is unfortunate to note that both the trial court, and the High Court, failed to provide an effective sentencing hearing to the accused, at the relevant stage, which is a right under Section 235(2) CrPC recognised by this Court in several cases. 109 In fact, it was argued by the accused that the trial court in contravention of this Court's judgments 110 , had proceeded to hear on sentencing almost immediate! y, depriving the accused of the opportunity to put forth their case for a less stringent sentence. The trial court order on sentencing, records in passing - the plea of \"young age\" and \"socio-economic factors\" as mitigating circumstances, but reflects, at best, a mechanical consideration of the same. Swayed by the brutality of the crime and \"shock of the collective and judicial conscience\", the High Court affirmed imposition of the death penalty solely on the basis of the aggravating circumstances of the crime, with negligible consideration of mitigating circumstances of the criminal. This is in direct contravention of Bachan Singh 82 . 260. The crime that the appellants have been held guilty of, is heinous; its execution was vicious and cruel, by any stretch of imagination. The deception practised by the appellants, in entering the flat, and, when encountering resistance, attacking the three women, was calculated and ruthless. The repeated stabbings of two of the deceased, almost in a frenzy, on the one hand, and the defenceless state of the victims, on the other, highlights that the accused were willing to go ahead with their plans ( of robbing) after eliminating the women of three generations. No doubt, two of the victims appear to have put up resistance, if one looks at the stab wounds inflicted all over their bodies, including on their arms and faces. Yet, they were unarmed and weak. 261. At the same time, the young age of the accused at the time of the incident (35, 20, 22, respectively) and lack of criminal antecedents (except in the case of Manoj, who was allegedly involved in a case of petty theft) cannot be lost sight of. Further, the prosecution case is silent on any real motive that 109 Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684, para 152: 1980 SCC (Cri) 580; Mohd. Mannan v.

This coupled with the fact that Rahul was shot in his leg during the commission of the crime, indicates that perhaps it is reasonable to assume that they were amateurs in a robbing-gone- wrong situation, who were not intent on taking the lives of these three women. One can surmise that having ventured to rob, perhaps they did not contemplate the kind of resistance that was put up by the victims, which led them to act the way they did, to continue with their plan, and ensure that the victims did not survive to tell the tale. 262. The reports received from the Superintendent of Jail reflect that each of the three accused, have a record of overall good conduct in prison and display inclination to reform. It is evident that they have already, while in prison, taken steps towards bettering their lives and of those around them, which coupled with their young age 111 unequivocally demonstrates that there is in fact, a probability of reform. On consideration of all the circumstances overall, we find that the option of life imprisonment is certainly not foreclosed. 263. While there is no doubt that this case captured the attention and indignation of the society in Indore, and perhaps the State of Madhya Pradesh, as a cruel crime that raised alarm regarding safety within the community - it must be remembered that public opinion has categorically been held to be neither an objective circumstance relating to crime, nor the criminal, and the courts must exercise judicial restraint and play a balancing role. 112 264. In view of the totality of facts and circumstances, and for the abovestated reasons, this Court finds that imposition of death sentence would be unwarranted in the present case. It would be appropriate and in the overall interests of justice to commute the death sentence of all three accused, to life imprisonment for a minimum term of 25 years. The appeals are partly allowed in the above terms. 111 Gurvail Singh v. State of Punjab, (2013) 2 SCC 713, paras 13, 19 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 864; Amit v.
