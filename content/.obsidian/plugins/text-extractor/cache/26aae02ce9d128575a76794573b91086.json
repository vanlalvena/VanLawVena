It can be said regarding that case that the truck was being driven for supplying the needs of army personnel engaged on military duties which could not be performed by civilians. It is at any rate safe to say that that case cannot be regarded as an authority for the general proposition that in no case can an action for damages be brought against the Government merely because the vehicle involved in the accident is an army truck driven by a military employee in the performance of some duty or other. The result is that I would answer the question referred to a Full Bench in the affirmative. The case may be returned to the Division Bench for consideration of any other point which may arise.

JUDGMENT FALSHAW, J.-This revision petition has arisen Falshaw, J. in the following circumstances. Sardara Singh respondent had applied for the grant of succes- sion certificate regarding a sum of about Rs. 3,000 lying in a Savings Bank account of Shrimati Bhag Bhari deceased, claiming to be her heir as nephew of her late husband. The present peti- tioner Ram Chand opposed the application and claimed that he should be given the succession certificate on the ground of a will made by the deceased in his favour on the 28th of August, 1958. He is apparently the brother of the deceas- ed. After the parties had led evidence the point was apparently raised that Ram Chand could not claim the property on the basis of a will without having obtained probate, reliance on this point being placed on the decision of Shamsher Bahadur, (1) (1961) 63 P.L.R. 473. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: ILR (Punjab & Haryana), © 2023 Punjab & Haryana High Court.

This contention prE:vailed and t1:e lower Court and another passed an order staying proceedings for · two months for the purpose of allowing Ram Chand Falshaw, J. to obtain probate from the appropriate Court. This order is challenged in the present peti- tion by Ram Chand, who claims that no probate is necessary. On this point he relies on the deci- sions in Sohan Singh and others v. Bhag Singh and others (2), and Ahemad and another v. Ghisia Hira Teli and another (3). In both these cases it was held even regarding immovable pro- perty that it was not necessary for probate to be obtained in order to set up a title based on a will. The relevant provisions of law are contained in sections 213 and 57 of the Succession Act of 1925. Section 213 reads- \"(l) No right as executor or legatee can be established in any Court of Justice, un- less a Court of competent jurisdiction in India has granted probate of the will under which the right is claimed, or has granted letters of administration with the will or with a copy of an authenticated copy of the will annexed. (2) This section shall not apply in the case of wills made by Muhammadans, and shall only apply in the case of wills made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or J aina where such wills are of the classes specified in clauses ( a) and (b) of section 57.\" The relevant part of section 57 reads- \"The provisions of this Part which are set out in Schedule III shall, subject to the restrictions and modifications specified therein, apply- ( a) to all wills and codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist,_ Sikh or J aina, on (1) (-19_6_1_) _6_3_P=--=.L-::.R~. 473.

There remains to be considered the decision ,of Shamsher Bahadur, J., in the case mentioned above, which is apparently based on the decision of a Full Bench in Ganshamdoss Narayandoss v. Gulab Bi Bai, (1). I find, however, on perusing this judgment that what has been held is that a defen- dant resisting a claim made by the plaintiff as heir-at-law cannot rely in defence on a will -executed in his favour at Madras in respect of property situate in Madras, when the will is not probated and no letters of administration with the will annexed have been granted. This is clearly in accordance with the provisions of sec- tions 213 and 57(a) of the Act, and the only point on which the matter was referred to the Full Bench was whether a will could be set up in defence in a suit without probate. As I have said the clear reading of the pro- visions of the Act leave no doubt whatever that no probate is necessary in order to set up a claim D) I.L.R. 50 Mad. 927. - Ram Chrmd v.
