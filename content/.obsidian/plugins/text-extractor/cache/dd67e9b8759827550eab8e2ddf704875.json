The petitioner wrote an undated letter to the Supreme Court alleging illegal detention, custodial torture and harassment to him and his family members by the police. The said letter was received by the Supreme Court on 19-11-1998 and was registered as a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. f The letter (re: alleged torture and illegal detention) In the letter the petitioner alleged that ASI DS (in charge of police post concerned), along with some police officers, came to his house on 10-3-1998 at about 11 a.m. to enquire about the whereabouts of his son J. When he informed them that he was not aware of it, they started beating him. Thereafter, the police took him, his wife and two minor daughters forcibly to the police post, through the bazaar. He was beaten with sticks on the way. At the police post, on direction g of the Superintendent of Police (SP), DS took the petitioner inside and beat him for about 10 minutes and brought him back before the SP again. By then, his wife and daughters were made to sit in an uncomfortable posture (as students are made to sit in schools by way of punishment). When the petitioner stated that he was not aware of his son's whereabouts, the SP became furious and ordered his men to remove his moustache, whereupon DS sat on his chest (with three h t Under A r ticle 32 of the Con stitution ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Again, they started beating the petitioner, searched his pockets and took away Rs 2350 which he was carrying. Then the police took him back to his house and ransacked the house. DS broke open the lock of his trunk and seized his licensed gun, some cartridges and arms licence, as also some jewellery found in the trunk. Thereafter, the petitioner was taken back to the police post. Though his wife and daughters were sent back to the house, he was illegally detained in police custody for a day and then taken to police station GH where he was kept for 10 days and during the first 5 days of such detention, he was regularly beaten. Because of such police harassment and torture, when he was released he and his younger son G fled from their house. Subsequently, when on 8-7-1998 the petitioner returned to his house, he was handcuffed and taken to the police post concerned by the police officers and was tortured by them. When he requested for water, he was forced to drink hot water with salt. He was kept in a wooden shikanza for 5 days and was not allowed to sleep. Then he was taken to a place J. After three days he was again taken back to the aforesaid police post and kept there for 2 days. Thereafter, he was released with a condition to visit the police post everyday in the morning and evening. The petitioner alleged that his friends and relatives who wanted to meet him, when he was being illegally detained, were not permitted to meet him and were also tortured. He also alleged that the police demanded money from him. In view of such torture he was forced to leave his house and remain outside. The petitioner prayed for a direction to the police to stop the atrocities and torture. He sought compensation for himself and his wife and daughters for the social, physical and financial loss, and return of his licensed gun, gold ornaments and other belongings. He also prayed for a thorough inquiry into the atrocities and torture committed by the police and imposition of punishment to those who were responsible. The alleged second round of harassment J, who was involved in several criminal cases, was arrested in June 1999, but he escaped from police custody on 25-1-2001. The petitioner filed an affidavit dated 22-2-2001 before the Supreme Court alleging interrogation by the police in regard to escape of J. He alleged that on 14-2-2001 he and his brother N were handcuffed and taken to the police station and interrogated and released on 15-2- 2001. A further affidavit was filed by the petitioner on 1-10-2001 wherein he alleged that his younger son G was forcibly taken from his sister's house on 22-6-2001 and tortured. The Supreme Court on not being satisfied with the enquiry report of the Inspector General of Police (Law and Order), directed CBI to inquire into the matter with reference to the allegations made in the letter as also the subsequent affidavits filed by the petitioner and his relatives and the reply-affidavits filed by the respondents. CBI held a preliminary inquiry and submitted the report. It concluded that some of the allegations of the petitioner were substantiated while several others were not substantiated. On the direction of the Supreme Court, an FIR was lodged against several police officers on 17-10-2002 under Sections 323, 342, 343, 365 and 384 IPC on the basis of the CBI report. On behalf of the petitioner, a submission was made that in such cases, apart from the CBI inquiry and criminal prosecution, compensation has to be awarded to the victims.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 180 SUPREME COURT CASES (2006) 3 sec having regard to the registration of the FIR, the matter may have to await the result of the prosecution. The Supreme Court directed hearing on the limited question as to whether compensation should be awarded or not. a The Supreme Court found that the petitioner and his relatives made false and exaggerated claims in regard to illegal detention, torture, etc. , apart from suppressing material facts. The fact of filing of writ petition before the High Court in the matter was not disclosed to the Supreme Court. There were many contradictions between the facts alleged before the Supreme Court and the High Court. Further, the CBI enquiry disclosed that the petitioner and his family members had not disowned J. They were regularly meeting J when he was in b custody. This fact was contrary to what was asserted in the letter. Disposing of the writ petition, the Supreme Court Held: Compensation as public law remedy for violation of Art. 21 It is now well settled that the award of compensation against the State is an appropriate and effective remedy for redressal of an established infringement of a c fundamental right under Article 21, by a public servant. The quantum of compensation will, however, depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Award of such compensation (by way of public law remedy) will not come in the way of the aggrieved person claiming additional compensation in a civil court , in the enforcement of the private law remedy in tort , nor come in the way of the criminal court orderin g compensation under Section 357 CrPC. Award of d compensation as a public law remedy for violation of the fundamental rights enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution , in addition to the private law remedy under the law of torts, was evolved in the last two-and-a-half decades.

State ofW.B. , (1997) 1 SCC 416: 1997 SCC (Cri ) 92, relied on Whether compensation should be awarded for every violation of Article 21 In cases where custodial death or custodial torture or other violation of the rights guaranteed under Article 21 is established , the courts may award f compensation in a proceeding under Article 32 or 226 . But, the cases where violation of Article 21 involving custodial death or torture is established or is incontrovertible stand on a different footing when compared to those cases where such violation is doubtful or not established. Where there is no independent evidence of custodial torture and where there is neither medical evidence about any injury or disability, resulting from custodial torture, nor any mark/scar, it may not be prudent to accept claims of human rights violation, by persons g having criminal records in a routine manner for awarding compensation. That may open the floodgates for false claims, either to mulct money from the State or as to prevent or thwart further investigation. The courts should, therefore, while zealously protecting the fundamental rights of those who are illegally detained or subjected to custodial violence, should also stand guard against false, motivated and frivolous claims in the interests of the society and to enable the police to h discharge their duties fearlessly and effectively.

(Paras 46 and 45) Before awarding compensation, the Court will have to pose to itself the following questions: (a) whether the violation of Article 21 is patent and incontrovertible, (b) whether the violation is gross and of a magnitude to shock the conscience of the court, (c) whether the custodial torture alleged has resulted in death or whether custodial torture is supported by medical report or visible marks or scars or disability. Where there is no evidence of custodial torture of a person except his own statement, and where such allegation is not supported by any medical report or other corroborative evidence, or where there are clear indications that the allegations are false or exaggerated fully or in part, the courts may not award compensation as a public law remedy under Article 32 or 226 , but relegate the aggrieved party to the traditional remedies by way of appropriate civil/criminal action.

State of Haryana, (1995) 3 SCC 757 : 1995 SCC (Cri ) 608 , relied on However, the Supreme Court should not be understood as holding that harassment and custodial violence is not serious or worthy of consideration, where there is no medical report or visible marks or independent evidence. It is a fact that harassment or custodial violence cannot always be supported by a medical report or independent evidence or proved by marks or scars. Every illegal detention irrespective of its duration, and every custodial violence, irrespective of its degree or magnitude, is outright condemnable and per se actionable. Remedy for such violation is available in civil law and criminal law. The public law remedy is additionally available where the conditions mentioned above are satisfied. (Para 4 7) The degree of proof required in criminal prosecution relating to such matters has been softened by earlier decisions of the Supreme Court. (Para 4 7) State of M.P. v. Shyamsunder Trivedi, (1995) 4 SCC 262 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 715; Shakila Abdul Gafar Khan v. Vasant Raghunath Dhoble, (2003) 7 SCC 749 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 1918; Munshi Singh Gautam v. State of M.P., (2005) 9 SCC 631 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 1269, relied on In the present case, there was reasonable cause for the police to think that the family members of J might know about his whereabouts. The repeated questioning of the family members of J in the years 1998 and 2001, either at their houses or by calling them to the police station/post was part of the investigation process and cannot, per se, be considered as harassment or violation of Article 21. Whether the police exceeded their limits in questioning the petitioner or his relatives is of course a different aspect. (Para 29) There is no clear or incontrovertible evidence about custodial torture, nor any medical report of any injury or disability. The grievance of the petitioner and his relatives is against different officers in different police stations at different points of time. More importantly, several of the allegations are proved to be exaggerated and false. Therefore, this is not a fit case for award of compensation. All reliefs which should be granted in such a case, have already been granted by ordering an inquiry by CBI and ensuring that the police officers named are ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Prologue ( according to the police) 2. On 10-3-1998, at about 10 a.m. Dharam Singh, ASI, Police Post Dhamtan Saheb (Narwana Tahsil, Jind district), along with Police Constables (Ramesh Chand, Jaldhir Singh and Baljit Singh), while patrolling near Dhamtan Saheb bus-stand, received information that one Joginder Singh (son of the petitioner) and his associates were conspiring in his house, to apply pressure on some tender-bidders. When the police party proceeded towards Joginder Singh's house, they saw two young men coming from the opposite side on a motorcycle. On seeing the police party, the motorcycle suddenly turned back. On suspicion, the police party gave chase and stopped the motorcycle near a petrol pump. The ASI asked the motorcyclist and the pillion-rider to identify themselves. The motorcyclist gave his name as Amrik Singh. The pillion-rider gave his name as Joginder Singh, a Palledar at Tohana. When the ASI asked Joginder Singh as to whether he was the same Joginder who had jumped parole in a case, Joginder Singh started running. When the police party chased him, Joginder Singh turned back, whipped out a pistol and fired at them. Baljit Singh, one of the constables, was hit and collapsed. In the ensuing confusion, both Amrik Singh and Joginder Singh escaped. The injured constable succumbed to the bullet injuries. In this connection, FIR No. 112 dated 10-3-1998 under Sections 302/307/352/186 IPC was registered in PS Garhi, against Joginder Singh and Amrik Singh. On receiving information of the death of the constable, the SP and the DSP rushed to the hospital and later went to Dhamtan Saheb police post. In the meantime, the police party which had gone to the house of Joginder, in search of him, did not find him and brought his father Sube Singh (the petitioner) to the police station. According to the police, the SDM and the Chairman of Zila Parishad, Jind, were also present at the police post at that time.

Because of such police harassment and torture, when he was released he and his younger son Gurmail Singh fled from his house. 7. On 8-7-1998, the petitioner returned to his house.

While adjourning the case, this Court observed that the question of awarding any compensation at that stage did not arise. 18. The SP, Jind, by affidavit dated 9-6-2003 informed this Court that the charge-sheet was filed in the Court of Baka Magistrate, Narwana, and that the case was fixed for 18-7-2003 for framing of charge.

The police contend that the allegations by the petitioner and his relatives, are by way of a well-conceived plot to prevent police investigation in regard to misdeeds by Joginder and his associates and to a pre-empt any action by the police against Joginder or his family members. 23. We will next refer to the factors which indicate that the petitioner and his relatives have made false and exaggerated claims in regard to illegal detention, torture, etc., apart from suppressing material facts. 24. In his letter to this Court, the petitioner has alleged that he was b illegally confined by the police for 11 days from 10-3-1998 (one day at Dhamtan Saheb police post and 10 days at Police Station Garhi). Rattan Singh (brother-in-law of the petitioner) in his affidavit dated 13-5-1999 alleges that he was illegally detained for 2 days and again for 4 days. But in the writ petition filed by the petitioner and Rattan Singh in the Punjab and Haryana High Court on 24-3-1998, it is alleged that the petitioner and Rattan c Singh were confined by the police between 10-3-1998 and 13-3-1998 (three days) and again for a day between 15-3-1998 and 16-3-1998. 25. The petitioner, in the letter to this Court, alleges beating and torture at Dhamtan Saheb police post on 10-3-1998 and at Police Station Garhi for five days in police custody between 11-3-1998 and 16-3-1998. Rattan Singh alleges torture for 2 days (from 10-3-1998 to 12-3-1998) and again for four d days (from 16-3-1998 to 20-3-1998). But in the writ petition filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court on 24-3-1998 by the petitioner and Rattan Singh, there is no allegation of beating or torture, but only expression of an apprehension that they may be arrested, harassed and tortured. (Note: The petitioner blames his counsel for not mentioning the facts properly in the writ petition filed before the High Court.) e 26. In the letter petition, the petitioner completely suppressed the fact that he (along with Rattan Singh) had filed a writ petition on 24-3-1998 in the Punjab and Haryana High Court in regard to the said incident (between 10-3-1998 to 21-3-1998) and the fact that the said writ petition was disposed of on 27-4-1998 by the High Court reserving liberty to file a criminal f complaint. 27. In the letter petition, the petitioner has alleged four \"misdeeds\" of the police on 10-3-1998: (a) his torture at the police post at Dhamtan Saheb police post by Dharam Singh, ASI at the instance of the Superintendent of Police and DSP, (b) mistreatment of wife and daughters of the petitioner at Dhamtan Saheb police post, (c) Rs 2350 being taken from his pocket by ASI g Dharam Singh, and (d) licensed gun, cartridges, arms licence and gold ornaments being illegally taken by ASI Dharam Singh on 10-3-1998. The CBI report finds that none of these four allegations is substantiated. 28. In the letter petition, the petitioner alleged that he had told the police that he was not on good terms with his son Joginder Singh, that he had already disowned him and the family was having no connection with h Joginder.

In his affidavit dated 31-8-2001 (filed in this case on 1-10-2001), the petitioner reiterates that he a has disowned his son Joginder and alleges that he did not have any contact with him; and that in spite of it, the police were continuously harassing him and his family members seeking information about the whereabouts of Joginder and raiding his house and his relatives' houses to find out whether Joginder was hiding there. But the CBI inquiry has categorically found that the petitioner and his family members had not disowned Joginder. They were b regularly meeting Joginder when he was in custody. The petitioner was travelling to meet his son Joginder whenever he was being produced in courts, in respect of different cases. In fact the petitioner received money from All India Food & Allied Workers' Palledar Union, Tohana (Kacchi Union) of which he was a member, to meet the expenses of the travel (to meet his son) on 25-10-2000, 25-11-2000, 21-12-2000, 13-1-2001, C 16-1-2001, 23-1-2001, 9-10-2001, 10-10-2001, 11-10-2001, 15-10-2001, 25-10-2001, 7-11-2001, 17-11-2001 and 20-11-2001. Further, the jail records showed that Joginder was met by the petitioner's wife on 26-8-1999, the petitioner's brother Narsi on 17-11-1999, 18-11-1999 and 1-3-2002, the petitioner's uncle Rama on 20-11-1999, and the petitioner's brother-in-law Rattan Singh on 5-3-2002. d 29. There was thus reasonable cause for the police to think that the family members of Joginder might know about his whereabouts. The repeated questioning of the family members of Joginder in the years 1998 and 2001, either at their houses or by calling them to the police station/post was part of the investigation process and cannot, per se, be considered as harassment or violation of Article 21. Whether the police exceeded their e limits in questioning the petitioner or his relatives is of course a different aspect. The report of CBI shows that there is prima facie evidence about the petitioner and some of his relatives being illegally detained in the police station/post and subjected possibly to some third-degree methods, to extract information regarding the whereabouts of Joginder Singh. At the same time, the report makes it clear that neither the illegal detention nor the alleged f torture (if true) was of an extent alleged by the petitioner and his relatives. The claims were clearly exaggerated and many a time false also. It is quite probable that the allegations against the police were levelled and/or exaggerated to avoid enquiries by the police in regard to Joginder. 30.

(b) direction to the Government concerned to hold an inquiry and take action against the officers responsible for the violation. (c) if the enquiry or action taken by the department concerned was found to be not satisfactory, to direct an inquiry by an independent agency, usually the Central Bureau of Investigation. b Award of compensation as a public law remedy for violation of the fundamental rights enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution, in addition to the private law remedy under the law of torts, was evolved in the last two-and-a-half decades. 32. In the Bhagalpur Blinding case [Khatri (II) v. State of Bihar 1] c Bhagwati, J. (as he then was), speaking for the Bench, posed the following question while considering the relief that could be given by a court for violation of constitutional rights guaranteed in Article 21 of the Constitution: (SCC p. 630, para 4) \"[B]ut if life or personal liberty is violated otherwise than in accordance with such procedure, is the court helpless to grant relief to d the person who has suffered such deprivation? Why should the court not be prepared to forge new tools and devise new remedies for the purpose of vindicating the most precious of the precious fundamental right to life and personal liberty.\" The question was expanded in a subsequent order in Bhagalpur Blinding case [Khatri (IV) v. State of Bihar 2] thus: (SCC p. 504, para 7) e \"If an officer of the State acting in his official capacity threatens to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty without the authority of law, can such person not approach the court for injuncting the State from acting through such officer in violation of his fundamental right under Article 21? Can the State urge in defence in such a case that it is not infringing the fundamental right of the petitioner under Article 21, f because the officer who is threatening to do so is acting outside the law and therefore beyond the scope of his authority and hence the State is not responsible for his action? Would this not make a mockery of Article 21 and reduce it to nullity, a mere rope of sand, for, on this view, if the officer is acting according to law there would ex concessionis be no breach of Article 21 and if he is acting without the authority of law, the 9 State would be able to contend that it is not responsible for his action and therefore there is no violation of Article 21. So also if there is any threatened invasion by the State of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21, the petitioner who is aggrieved can move the court 1 (1981) 1 sec 627 : 1981 sec (Cri) 228 2 (1981) 2 sec 493 : 1981 sec (Cri) 503 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

STATE OF HARYANA (Raveendran, ].) 195 under Article 32 for a writ injuncting such threatened invasion and if there is any continuing action of the State which is violative of the fundamental right under Article 21, the petitioner can approach the court under Article 32 and ask for a writ striking down the continuance of such action, but where the action taken by the State has already resulted in breach of the fundamental right under Article 21 by deprivation of some limb of the petitioner, would the petitioner have no remedy under Article 32 for breach of the fundamental right guaranteed to him? Would the court permit itself to become helpless spectator of the violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner by the State and tell the petitioner that though the Constitution has guaranteed the fundamental right to him and has also given him the fundamental right of moving the court for enforcement of his fundamental right, the court cannot give him any relief.\" 33. Answering the said questions, it was held that when a court trying the writ petition proceeds to inquire into the violation of any right to life or personal liberty, while in police custody, it does so, not for the purpose of adjudicating upon the guilt of any particular officer with a view to punishing him but for the purpose of deciding whether the fundamental right of the petitioners under Article 21 has been violated and the State is liable to pay compensation to them for such violation. This Court clarified that the nature and object of the inquiry is altogether different from that in a criminal case and any decision arrived at in the writ petition on this issue cannot have any relevance much less any binding effect, in any criminal proceeding which may be taken against a particular police officer. This Court further clarified that in a given case, if the investigation is still proceeding, the Court may even defer the inquiry before it until the investigation is completed or if the Court considered it necessary in the interests of justice, it may postpone its inquiry until after the prosecution was terminated, but that is a matter entirely for the exercise of the discretion of the Court and there is no bar precluding the Court from proceeding with the inquiry before it, even if the investigation or prosecution is pending. 34. In Rudul Sah v. State of Bihar 3 the petitioner therein approached this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution alleging that though he was acquitted by the Sessions Court on 3-6-1968, he was released from jail only on 6-10-1982, after 14 years, and sought compensation for his illegal detention. This Court while recognising that Article 32 cannot be used as a substitute for the enforcement of rights and obligations which can be enforced efficaciously through the ordinary processes of courts, civil and criminal, raised for consideration the important question as to whether in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 32, this Court can pass an order for payment of money, as compensation for the deprivation of a fundamental right. This Court answered the question thus while awarding compensation: (SCC pp. 147-48, para 10) 3 (1983) 4 sec 141 : 1983 sec (Cri) 798 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

One of the telling a ways in which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Article 21 secured, is to mulct its violators in the payment of monetary compensation. Administrative sclerosis leading to flagrant infringement of fundamental rights cannot be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary to adopt. The right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities b which act in the name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the State as a shield. If civilisation is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some others too well known to suffer mention, it is necessary to educate ourselves into accepting that, respect for the rights of individuals is the true bastion of democracy. Therefore, the State must repair the damage done by its officers to the c petitioner's rights. It may have recourse against those officers.\" Rudul Sah 3 was followed in Bhim Singh v.

In that case, the deceased was arrested by the police, handcuffed and kept in police custody. The next day, his dead body was found on a railway track. d This Court awarded compensation to the mother of the deceased. J.S. Verma, J. (as he then was) spelt out the following principles: \"[A]ward of compensation in a proceeding under Article 32 by this Court or by the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is a remedy available in public law, based on strict liability for contravention e of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply, even though it may be available as a defence in private law in an action based on tort.

The defence of sovereign immunity being inapplicable, and alien to the concept of guarantee of fundamental rights, there can be no question of such a defence being available in the constitutional remedy. It is this principle which justifies award of monetary compensation for contravention of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, when that is the only practicable mode of redress available for the contravention made by the State or its servants in the purported exercise of their powers, and enforcement of the fundamental right is claimed by resort to the remedy in public law under the Constitution by recourse to Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. (SCC pp. 762-63, paras 16-17)\" (emphasis supplied) 36. Dr. A.S. Anand, J., (as he then was) in his concurring judgment elaborated the principle thus: \"[C]onvicts, prisoners or undertrials are not denuded of their fundamental rights under Article 21 and it is only such restrictions, as are permitted by law, which can be imposed on the enjoyment of the fundamental rights by such persons. It is an obligation of the State to ensure that there is no infringement of the indefeasible rights of a citizen to life, except in accordance with law, while the citizen is in its custody. (SCC p. 767, para 31) * * * The public law proceedings serve a different purpose than the private law proceedings. The relief of monetary compensation, as exemplary damages, in proceedings under Article 32 by [the Supreme] Court or under Article 226 by the High Courts, for established infringement of the indefeasible right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution is a remedy available in public law and is based on the strict liability for contravention of the guaranteed basic and indefeasible rights of the citizen. The purpose of public law is not only to civilise public power but also to assure the citizens that they live under a legal system which aims to protect their interests and preserve their rights. Therefore, when the court moulds the relief by granting 'compensation' in proceedings under Article 32 or 226 of the Constitution seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights, it does so under the public law by way of penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on the State which has failed in its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen. The payment of compensation in such cases is not to be understood as it is generally understood in a civil action for damages under the private law but in the broader sense of providing relief by an order of making 'monetary amends' under the public law for the wrong done due to breach of public duty, of not protecting the fundamental rights of the citizen. The compensation is in the nature of 'exemplary damages' awarded against the wrongdoer for the breach of its public law duty and is independent of the rights available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation under the private law in an action based on tort, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

State of W.B. 7 this Court again considered a exhaustively the question and held that monetary compensation should be awarded for established infringement of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21. This Court held: \"Custodial violence, including torture and death in the lock-ups, strikes a blow at the rule of law, which demands that the powers of the executive should not only be derived from law but also that the same b should be limited by law. Custodial violence is a matter of concern. It is aggravated by the fact that it is committed by persons who are supposed to be the protectors of the citizens. It is committed under the shield of uniform and authority in the four walls of a police station or lock-up, the victim being totally helpless. The protection of an individual from torture and abuse by the police and other law-enforcing officers is a matter of c deep concern in a free society. (SCC p. 424, para 9) * * * Any form of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment would fall within the inhibition of Article 21 of the Constitution, whether it occurs during investigation, interrogation or otherwise. If the d functionaries of the Government become lawbreakers, it is bound to breed contempt for law and would encourage lawlessness and every man would have the tendency to become law unto himself thereby leading to anarchy. No civilised nation can permit that to happen. Does a citizen shed off his fundamental right to life, the moment a policeman arrests him? Can the right to life of a citizen be put in abeyance on his arrest? ... e The answer, indeed, has to be an emphatic 'No'. (SCC p. 429, para 22) * * * Police is, no doubt, under a legal duty and has legitimate right to arrest a criminal and to interrogate him during the investigation of an offence but it must be remembered that the law does not permit use of third-degree methods or torture of accused in custody during f interrogation and investigation with a view to solve the crime. End cannot justify the means. The interrogation and investigation into a crime should be in true sense purposeful to make the investigation effective. By torturing a person and using third-degree methods, the police would be accomplishing behind the closed doors what the demands of our legal order forbid. No society can permit it.\" g 38. It is thus now well settled that the award of compensation against the State is an appropriate and effective remedy for redress of an established infringement of a fundamental right under Article 21, by a public servant. The quantum of compensation will, however, depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

This takes us to the next question as to whether compensation should be awarded under Articles 32/226 for every violation of Article 21 where illegal detention or custodial violence is alleged. Whether compensation should be awarded for every violation of Article 21 40. In M. C. Mehta v. Union of India 8 a Constitution Bench of this Court while considering the question whether compensation can be awarded in a petition under Article 32, observed thus: (SCC pp. 408-09, para 7) \"We must, therefore, hold that Article 32 is not powerless to assist a person when he finds that his fundamental right has been violated. He can in that event seek remedial assistance under Article 32. The power of the court to grant such remedial relief may include the power to award compensation in appropriate cases. We are deliberately using the words 'in appropriate cases' because we must make it clear that it is not in every case where there is a breach of a fundamental right committed by the violator that compensation would be awarded by the court in a petition under Article 32. The infringement of the fundamental right must be gross and patent, that is, incontrovertible and ex facie glaring and either such infringement should be on a large scale affecting the fundamental rights of a large number of persons, or it should appear unjust or unduly harsh or oppressive on account of their poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position to require the person or persons affected by such infringement to initiate and pursue action in the civil courts. Ordinarily, of course, a petition under Article 32 should not be used as a substitute for enforcement of the right to claim compensation for infringement of a fundamental right through the ordinary process of civil court. It is only in exceptional cases of the nature indicated by us above, that compensation may be awarded in a petition under Article 32 . ... Ifwe make a fact analysis of the cases where compensation has been awarded by this Court, we will find that in all the cases, the fact of infringement was patent and incontrovertible, the violation was gross and its magnitude was such as to shock the conscience of the court and it would have been gravely unjust to the person whose fundamental right was violated, to require him to go to the civil court/or claiming compensation.\" (emphasis supplied) 41. In Nilabati Behera 6 this Court put in a word of caution thus: (SCC p. 769, para 35) \"Of course, relief in exercise of the power under Article 32 or 226 would be granted only once it is established that there has been an infringement of the fundamental rights of the citizen and no other form 8 (1987) 1 sec 395 : 1987 sec (L&S) 1 6 Nilabati Behera v.

In D.K. Basu 7 this Court repeatedly stressed that compensation can b be awarded only for redressal of an established violation of Article 21. This Court also drew attention to the following aspect: (SCC p. 434, para 31) \"31. There is one other aspect also which needs our consideration. We are conscious of the fact that the police in India have to perform a difficult and delicate task, particularly in view of the deteriorating law and order situation, communal riots, political turmoil, student unrest, c terrorist activities, and among others the increasing number of underworld and armed gangs and criminals. Many hardcore criminals like extremists, terrorists, drug peddlers, smugglers who have organised gangs, have taken strong roots in the society. It is being said in certain quarters that with more and more liberalisation and enforcement of fundamental rights, it would lead to difficulties in the detection of crimes d committed by such categories of hardened criminals by soft peddling interrogation. It is felt in those quarters that if we lay too much of emphasis on protection of their fundamental rights and human rights, such criminals may go scot-free without exposing any element or iota of criminality with the result, the crime would go unpunished and in the ultimate analysis the society would suffer. The concern is genuine and the e problem is real. To deal with such a situation, a balanced approach is needed to meet the ends of justice. This is all the more so, in view of the expectation of the society that police must deal with the criminals in an efficient and effective manner and bring to book those who are involved in the crime.

State of Haryana 11 this Court refused compensation where the petitioner had exaggerated the incident and had indulged in falsehood. This Court held: (SCC pp. 782-83, para 54) \"54. Since, from the report of CBI and our own independent appraisal of the evidence recorded by CBI, we have come to the conclusion that Shri Dhananjay Sharma and Sushil Kumar had been illegally detained by Respondents 3 to 5 from the afternoon of 15-1-1994 to 17-1-1994, the State must be held responsible for the unlawful acts of its officers and it must repair the damage done to the citizens by its officers for violating their indefeasible fundamental right of personal liberty without any authority of law in an absolutely high-handed manner. We would have been, therefore, inclined to direct the State Government of Haryana to compensate Dhananjay Sharma and Sushil Kumar but since Sushil Kumar has indulged in falsehood in this Court and Shri Dhananjay Sharma has also exaggerated the incident by stating that on 15-1-1994 when he was waylaid along with Sushi[ Kumar and Shri S. C. Puri, Advocate, two employees of Respondents 6 and 7 were also present with the police party, which version has not been found to be correct by CBI, they both have disentitled themselves from receiving any compensation, as monetary amends for the wrong done by Respondents 3 to 5, in detaining them. We, therefore, do not direct the payment of any compensation to them.\" (emphasis supplied) 45. Cases where violation of Article 21 involving custodial death or torture is established or is incontrovertible stand on a different footing when compared to cases where such violation is doubtful or not established. Where there is no independent evidence of custodial torture and where there is neither medical evidence about any injury or disability, resulting from custodial torture, nor any mark/scar, it may not be prudent to accept claims of human rights violation, by persons having criminal records in a routine manner for awarding compensation. That may open the floodgates for false claims, either to mulct money from the State or as to prevent or thwart further investigation. The courts should, therefore, while zealously protecting the fundamental rights of those who are illegally detained or subjected to custodial violence, should also stand guard against false, motivated and frivolous claims in the interests of the society and to enable the police to discharge their duties fearlessly and effectively. While custodial torture is not infrequent, it should be borne in mind that every arrest and detention does not lead to custodial torture. 46. In cases where custodial death or custodial torture or other violation of the rights guaranteed under Article 21 is established, the courts may award compensation in a proceeding under Article 32 or 226. However, before awarding compensation, the Court will have to pose to itself the following questions: (a) whether the violation of Article 21 is patent and 11 (1995) 3 sec 757 : 1995 sec (Cri) 608 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Where there is no evidence of custodial torture of a person except his own statement, and where such allegation is not supported by any medical report or other corroborative evidence, or where there are clear indications that the allegations are false or exaggerated fully or in part, the courts may not award compensation as a public law remedy under Article 32 or 226, but relegate the aggrieved party b to the traditional remedies by way of appropriate civil/criminal action. 47. We should not, however, be understood as holding that harassment and custodial violence is not serious or worthy of consideration, where there is no medical report or visible marks or independent evidence. We are conscious of the fact that harassment or custodial violence cannot always be supported by a medical report or independent evidence or proved by marks or c scars. Every illegal detention irrespective of its duration, and every custodial violence, irrespective of its degree or magnitude, is outright condemnable and per se actionable. Remedy for such violation is available in civil law and criminal law. The public law remedy is additionally available where the conditions mentioned in the earlier paragraph are satisfied. We may also note that this Court has softened the degree of proof required in criminal d prosecution relating to such matters. In State of M.P. v. Shyamsunder Trivedi 12, reiterated in Abdul Gafar Khan 9 and Munshi Singh Gautam 1°, this Court observed: (SCC pp. 272- 73, paras 16-17) \"[R]arely in cases of police torture or custodial death, direct ocular evidence of the complicity of the police personnel would be available, .... Bound as they are by the ties of brotherhood, it is not unknown that e the police personnel pref er to remain silent and more often than not even pervert the truth to save their colleagues, .... The exaggerated adherence to and insistence upon the establishment of proof beyond every reasonable doubt, by the prosecution, ignoring the ground realities, the fact situations and the peculiar circumstances of a given case, ... , often results in miscarriage of f justice and makes the justice-delivery system suspect. In the ultimate analysis the society suffers and a criminal gets encouraged. Tortures in police custody, which of late are on the increase, receive encouragement by this type of an unrealistic approach of the courts because it reinforces the belief in the mind of the police that no harm would come to them, if an odd prisoner dies in the lock-up, because there would hardly be any g evidence available to the prosecution to directly implicate them with the torture .\" ( emphasis in original) 12 (1995) 4 sec 262: 1995 sec (Cri) 715 9 Shakila Abdul Gafar Khan v.

Unfortunately, police in the country have given room for an impression in the minds of public, that whenever there is a crime, investigation usually means rounding up all persons concerned (say all servants in the event of a theft in the employer's house, or all acquaintances of the deceased, in the event of a murder) and subjecting them to third-degree interrogation in the hope that someone will spill the beans. This impression may not be correct, but instances are not wanting where police have resorted to such a practice. Lack of training in scientific investigation methods, lack of modern equipment, lack of adequate personnel and lack of a mindset respecting human rights, are generally the reasons for such illegal action. One other main reason is that the public (and men in power) expect results from police in too short a span of time, forgetting that methodical and scientific investigation is a time-consuming and lengthy process. Police are branded as inefficient even when there is a short delay in catching the culprits in serious crimes. The expectation of quick results in high-profile or heinous crimes builds enormous pressure on the police to somehow \"catch\" the \"offender\". The need to have quick results tempts them to resort to third-degree methods. They also tend to arrest \"someone\" in a hurry on the basis of incomplete investigation, just to ease the pressure. Time has come for an attitudinal change not only in the minds of the police, but also on the part of the public. Difficulties in criminal investigation and the time required for such investigation should be recognised, and police should be allowed to function methodically without interferences or unnecessary pressures. If police are to perform better, the public should support them, Government should strengthen and equip them, and men in power should not interfere or belittle them. The three wings of the Government should encourage , insist and ensure thorough scientific investigation under proper legal procedures, followed by prompt and efficient prosecution. Be that as it may. 49. Custodial violence requires to be tackled from two ends , that is, by taking measures that are remedial and preventive. Award of compensation is one of the remedial measures after the event. Effort should be made to remove the very causes, which lead to custodial violence, so as to prevent such occurrences. Following steps, if taken, may prove to be effective preventive measures: (a) Police training should be reoriented, to bring in a change in the mindset and attitude of the police personnel in regard to investigations, so that they will recognise and respect human rights, and adopt thorough and scientific investigation methods. (b) The functioning of lower level police officers should be continuously monitored and supervised by their superiors to prevent custodial violence and ensure adherence to lawful standard methods of investigation. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(d) Simple and foolproof procedures should be introduced for prompt a registration of first information reports relating to all crimes. (e) Computerisation, video-recording and modern methods of record maintenance should be introduced to avoid manipulations, insertions, substitutions and antedating in regard to FIRs, mahazars, inquest proceedings, post-mortem reports and statements of witnesses, etc. and to b bring in transparency in action. (j) An independent investigating agency (preferably the respective Human Rights Commissions or CBI) may be entrusted with adequate power, to investigate complaints of custodial violence against police personnel and take stern and speedy action followed by prosecution, wherever necessary. The endeavour should be to achieve a balanced level of functioning, where police respect human rights, adhere to law, and take confidence-building measures (CBMs), and at the same time, firmly deal with organised crime, terrorism, white-collared crime, deteriorating law and order situation, etc. Conclusion 50. In this case, there is no clear or incontrovertible evidence about custodial torture, nor any medical report of any injury or disability. The grievance of the petitioner and his relatives is against different officers in different police stations at different points of time. More importantly, several C d of the allegations are proved to be exaggerated and false. We, therefore, do not consider this to be a fit case for award of compensation. All reliefs which e should be granted in such a case, have already been granted by ordering an inquiry by CBI and ensuring that the police officers named are prosecuted. The law will have to take its own course. 51. This order will not come in the way of any civil court awarding compensation in an action in tort or the criminal court awarding compensation under Section 357 CrPC in the pending prosecution against f any of the officers, if the charges are established. With the said observations, we dispose of this petition, as no further reliefs/directions are called for. 52. We record our appreciation for the effort put in by Shri S. Muralidhar, Amicus Curiae, in presenting the matter. 7 D.K. Basu v. State ofWB., (1997) 1 SCC 416: 1997 SCC (Cri) 92 g h","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
