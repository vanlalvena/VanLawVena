CHINNAPPA REDDY, JJ.J Penal' Code--Atte1npt to con1mit an offence-What constitutes-\"I'repara- tion\" and \"attenipt\" distinction. The respondents were charged with th'e offence of attempting to smuggle out cf India 43 silver ingots in violation of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 and the Customs Act, l 962. The prosecution alleged that on the night of the occurrence the res.pondents carried in a truck and a jeep silver ingots some of which were concealed in a shawl, and some others hidden in saw-dust bags from Bombay to a lon-ely creek nearby and that when the ingots were unloaded n'ear the creek the sound of the engine of a mechanised s·ea-craft from the side of the creek was heard by the Customs officials and that therefore they were guilty of attempting to ~muggle silver out of India. The respondents pleaded that they w'ere not aware of the presence of silver ingots in the vehicles, that they were only employed for driving the jeep and the truck to another destination and that the police stopped them en route and had driven them to the creek. E The Trial Court convicted and sent.enced them to vaI_:ious terms of imprio;on- ment and fine. • \\ On appeal, the Sessions Judge acquitted all the respondents taking the view that the facts proved showed no more than that the accused had only marle _/ \"preparations\" for bringing the silver to the creek and \"had not con1mittcd any -...___ ~ act amounting to a direct mov'ement towards the commission of the offence\" and F that until the silver was put in the boat with intent to export, it would merely be in the stage of preparation 'falling short of an \"attempt\" to export in contra- vention of the law.

The High Court was in error in holding that the circumstances established by the prosecution fell short of constituting the offence of an \"attempt\" to export unlawfully silver out of Jndia. [1165F] 2. The expression \"attempt\" within the .meaning of the penal provision\" is wide enough to take in its fold any one or series of acts committed beyond the stage of preparation in moving- contraband goods deliberately to the place of embarkation, such act or acts 1'eing reasonably proximate to the completior. of the unlawful export.

The definition of 'proved' contained in section 3 of the Evidence Act does not draw any distinction between cir.::umstantial 2.n<l other evidence. If the ·circumslances establish such a high degree of probability that a prudent n1~1n ought to act on the supposition that the accused was attempting to export silver from Jndia in contravention of the law, that woukl be ~ufficicnt proof rJf tbc.t fact in issue. [1164A·B] 4(a.) What constitutes an \"attempt\" is a mixed question of law and fact, depending largely on the circumstances of the particular case. \"Attempt\" defie~ a precise and exr.::t definition. Bro•adly speaking, all crimes which cons1\"-t of the commission of affirmative acts are preceded by some covert or ov~rt conduct which may be divided into three stages : the first stage exists when the c;.ilplit first entertains the idea or intention to commit an offen•;;;e; in the s'econd stage he makes preparations to commit it; and the third stage is reac_hed when the culprit takes. delib'~rate overt steps to commit the offence. Such overt act 01 step, in order to be criminal, need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of the offence. It is sufficient if such act or acts were deliberately done and manifest a clear intention to commit the offence aimed, being reasonably proxi~ ma(e to the consu1nmation of lhe offence. [1164C-E] Abhayanand Mishra v. State of Bihar, [1962] 2 S.C.R. 241, followed. (b) There is a distinC:tion between \"preparation\" and \"attempt\". Attempt begins where preparation ends. In sum, a p'erson commits the offence of 'at· -tempt to commit a particular offence' when (i) he intends to commit that part?· cul.ar offence c.nd (ii) he, having made preparations and ·with the int'euti,)n to commit the offence, does an act towards its commission; such an ac.t need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence but must be an act during the course of co1nmiting that offence. [1164E-F] In the instant case the respondents carried silver ingots in the two vchicle3 to the sea-shore and started unloading them near a creek from which the sound of the engin'e of a sea-craft was heard. In short they did all that was necc<;sary to expert the silver ingots by sea and the only step that remain1::d was to l•J1d then1 on the soo-craift for moving out of the territorial waters of the counlry. But for the intervention of the Customs officials, the unlawful export would have been consummated. The disappearance of the sea-craft reinforces the inference that the accused had delib'i!rately attempted to export silver by sea in con:ruven~ tion of law. [1164G-H] Chinnappa Reddy, J (concurring), Jn order to constitute rut \".attempt\" first there must be an intention tv com- mit a particular offence, second, some act must have been done which wcu!d n'ecessarily have to be done towards the commission of the offence and third suih act must be 'proximate' to the intended result. The measure of prciximity is not in relation to time and action but in relation to intention. In other words, the act must reveal with reasonGble c'erta.inty, in conjunction ~with other facts and circumstances and not necessarily in isolation, an intention as d;stin- guished from a mere· desire or object to commit the particular offence, though the act by itself may be merely suggestive or indicative of such intention.

It could be said that the accused were transporting or attempting to tninsport the silver somewhere but it would not necessarily suggest or inJicate that the inrention was to export silver. The fact that the truck was dri\\'.en up tu a lonely creek from where the silver rould be transferred into a sea-faring vessel was suggestive or indicative, though not conclusive, that the accus'ed want~ ed to export the silver. It might have been open to the accused to plead thr.t the silver was not to be exported but only to be transported in the course of inter-coastal trade. But the circumstMlce that all this was done in a clandtstine fashion, at dead of night revealed, with reasonable certainty,_ th'e intention of the accused that the silver was to be exported.

The following Judgments were delivered : ' SARKARIA, J.--This appeal by special leave preferred by the State ~' of Maharashtra, is directed against a judgment <4_ted November 1, F 1973, of the Bombay High Court. Mohd. Yakub respondent 1, Shaikh Jamadar Mithnbhai respon- dent 2, and Issak Hasanali Shaikh respondent 3, were tried in the court of the Jndicial Magistrate First Class, Bassein, 13-0mbay, in respect of three sets of offences punishable under section 135 read G · with section 135 (2) of the Customs Act, 1962. The first charge was the violation of sections 12(1), 23(1) and 23 (d) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, the second was violation of Exports (Contrcl) Order No. 1 of 1968 E.T.C. dated March 8, 1.968: rnd the third was the contravention of the provisions of Sections 7, 8, 33 and 34 of the Customs Act, 1962. They were also charged for H violation of the Exports (Control) Order No. 1/68 E.T.C. dated March 8, 1968 issued under sections 3 and 4 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 punishable under section 5 of the said ' \\ -. ' I MAHARASHTRA v. MOHD. YAKUB (Sarkaria, !.) I J 61 Act. The gist of the charges was that the respondents attempted to A smuggle out of India 43 silver ingots\", weighing 1312.410 kgs., worth about Rs. 8 lakhs, in violation of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, the Imports & Exports (Control) Act, 1947, and the Customs Act. The facts of the case were as follows : On receiving some secret information that silver would be trans- ported in Jeep No. MRC-9930 and Truck No. BMS-796 from Bom- bay to a coastal place near Bassein, Shri Wagh, Superintendent of Central Excise along with Inspector Dharap and the staff proceeded in two vehicles to keep a watch on the night of September 14, 1968 at Shirsat Naka on the National Highway No. 8, Bombay City. At about mid-night, the aforesaid jeep was seen coming from Bombay followed by a truck. These two vehicles were proceeding towards Bassein. The officers followed the truck and the jeep which, after travelling some distance from Shirsat Naka, came to a fork in the road and thereafter, insteac\\ of taking the road leading to Bassein, proceeded on the new National Highway leading to Kaman village and Ghodbunder Creek. Ultimately, the jeep and truck halted near a bridge at Kaman creek whereafter the ~CCJ!Sed removed some small and heavy bundles from the truck and placed them aside on the ground. The Customs Officers rushed to the spot and accosted the persons present there. At the same time, the sound of the engine of a mechanised sea-craft . from the side of the creek was heard by the officers. The officers surrounded the vehicles and found four silver ingots near the foot- path leading to the creek. Respondent 1 was the driver and the sole occupant of the jeep, while the other two respondents were the driver and cleaner of the truck. The officers sent for Kana and Sathe, both residents of Bassein. In their presence, respondent 1 was questioned about his identity. He falsely gave his name and address as Mohamad Yusuf s/o Say.yad Ibrahim residing at Kamathi- pura. From the personal search of respondent 1, a pistol, knife and currency notes of Rs. 2,133/- were found. Fifteen silver ingots concealed in a shawl were found in the rear side of the jeep and twenty-four silver ingots were found lying under saw-dust bags in the truck. The truck and the jeep together with the accused-respondents and the silver ingots were taken to Shirsat Naka where a detailed panchanama was drawn up. Respondent 1 had no licence for keep- ing a pistol. Consequently the matter was reported to Police Station Bassein, for prosecuting the respondent under the Arms Act. B c D E F G 0 A 8 c n E F G 1162 SUPREM!l° COURT REPORTS [1980] 2 S.C.R. The respondents and the vehicles and the silver ingots were taken to Bombay on September 15, 1-968. The statements of Um respon- dents under section 108 of the Customs Act were recorded by Shri Wagh, Superintendent of Central Excise. The Collector, Central Excise, by his order elated May 28, !969, confiscated the silver ingots. After obtaining the requisite sanction, \"the Assistant Collec- tor, Central Excise made a complaint against all the three accused in the court of the Judicial Magistrate, Basscin for trial in respect of the aforesaid offences. The plea of the accused was of plain denial of the prosecution case. They stated that they were not aware of the alleged silver and· that they had just been employed for carrying the jeep and the truck to another destination. They alleged that they were driven to the creek by the police. The trial Magistrate convicted the accused of the aforesaid offen- ces and sentenced accused I to two years' rigorous imprisonment ai1d a fine of Rs. 2,000 and, in default, to suffer further six months' rigorous imprisonment. Accused 2 and 3 were to suffer six montl1s' rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 500 and, in default, to suffer two months' rigorous imprisonment. The accused preferred three appeals in the court of the Additiom1l Sessions Judge, Thana, who, ]Jy his common judgment dated Septem- ber 30, 1973, allowed the appeals and acquitted them on the ground that the facts proved by the prosecution fell short of establishing that the accused had 'attempted' to export silver in contravention of the law, because the facts proved showed no more than that the accused had only made 'preparations' for bringing this silver to the creek and \"had not yet committed any act amounting to a direct movement towards the commission of the offence\". Jn his view, until silver was pnt in the boat for the purpose of taking out of the country with intent to export it, the matter would be merely in the s.tage of 'pre- paration' falling short of an 'attempt' to export it. Since 'prepara- tion' to commit the offence of exporting silver was not punishable under the Customs Act, he acquitted the accused. Against this acquitt:il, the State of Maharashtra carried an app<:al H to the High Court, wh:ch, by its judgment dated November I, 1973, dismissed the appeal and upheld the acquittal of the accused-respon- dents. Hence, this appeal. I .. ~ • ~-- MAHARASHTRA v. MOHD. YAKUB (Sarkaria, J.) 116 J In the instant case, the trial court and' the Sessions Judge con- A cmrently held that the following circumstances had been established by the prosecution: (a) The officers (Shri Wagh and party) had received definite information that silver would be carried in a truck and a jeep from Bombay to Bassein for exporting from the country and for this purpose they kept a watch at Shirsat Naka and then followed the jeep an_d the truck at some distance. (b) Accused 1 was driv:ng the jeep, while accused 2 was driving the truck and accused 3 was cleaner on it. ( c) Fifteen silver ingots were found concealed in the jeep and 24 silver ingots were found hidden in the truck. ( d) The jeep and the truck were parked near the Kaman creek from where they could be easily loaded in some B c sea craft. D (e) Four silver ingots from the vehicle had been actually unloaded and were found lying by the side of the road near the foot-path leading to the sea. (f) On being questioned accused 1 gave his false name and address. E (g) The accused were not dealers in silver. The trial Magistrate further held that just when the officers surrounded these vehicles and caught the accused, the sound of the engine of a mechanised vessel was heard from the creek. The first appellate court did not d!scount this fact, but held that this circum- F stance did not have any probative value. The question, therefore, is whether from the facts and circum- stances, enumerated above, it could be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that the respondents had attempted to export the silver in con- travention of law from India ? G. At the outset, it may be noted that the Evidence Act does not insist on absolute proof for the simple reason that perfect proof in this imperfect world is seldom to be found. That is why under Sec- tion 3 of the Evidence Act, a fact is said to be 'proved' when, after considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition H • MAHARASHTRA v. MOHD. YAKUB (Sarkaria, !.) 1165 sea, had been taken. The only s!ep that remained to be taken to- wards the export of the silver was to load it on a sea-craft for moving out of the territorial waters of India. But for the intervention of the officers of law, the unlawful export of silver would haVle been con- summated. The calendestine disappearance of the sea-craft when the officers intercepted and rounded up the vehicles and the accused at the creek, reinforces the inference that the accused had deliberately attempted to export silver by sea in contravention of law. It is important to bear in mind that the penal provisions with which we are concerned have been enacted to suppress the evil of smuggling precious metal out of India. Smuggling is an anti- social activity which advers~ly affects the public revenues, the earn' ing of foreign exchange, the financial stability and the economy of the country. A narrow interpretation of the word \"attempt\" there- fore, in these penal provisions which will impair their efficacy as instruments for combating this baneful activity has to be eschewed. These provisions should be construed in a mann~r which wonld suppress the mischief, promote their object, prevent their subtle evasion and foil their artful circumvention. Thus, construed, the ex- pression \"attempt\" within the meaning of these penal provisions is wide enough to take in its fold any one or series of acts committed, beyond the stage of preparation in moving the contr1,1band goods deli- berately to the place of embarkation, such act or acts being reason- ably proximate to the completion of the unlawful export. The infer- ence arising out of the facts and circumstances established by the prosecution, unerringly pointed to the conclusion, that the accused had committed the offence of attempting to export silver out of India by sea, in contravention of law. For reasons aforesaid, we are of opinion that the High Court was in error in holding that the circumstances established by the prosecu- tion fell short of constituting the offence of an 'attempt' to export un- lawfully, silver out of India. We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the acquittal of the accused-respondents and convict them under A • c D E F Section 135(a) of the Costoms Act, 1962 read with Section 5 of the G Imports and Exports Control Act, 1947 and the Order issued there- under, and sentence them as under : Accused-respondent 1, Mohd. Yakub is sentenced to suffer one year's rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 2,000 and, in default, to suffer six months' further rigorous imprisonment. Accused respon- H dents 2 and 3, namely, Sheikh Jamadar Mithubhai and Issak Hasan- ali Shaikh are each sentenced to six months' rigorous imprisonment • I MAHARASHTRA v. MOHD. YAKUB (Chinnappa Reddy,!.) 1167 defendant would have been required. It was the last act, depending on himself towards the payment of the money, and therefore it ought to be considered as an attempt\". As a general principle th!'; test of 'the last possible act before the achievement of the end' would be entirely unacceptable. If that princi- ple be correct, a person who has cocked his gun at another and is about to pull the trigger but is prevented from doing so by the inter- vention of someone or something cannot be convicted of attempt to murder. Another popular formulation of what constitutes 'attempt' is that of Stephen in his Digest of the Criminal Law where he said : \"An attempt to commit a crime is an ac~ done' with intent to commit that crime and forming part of a series of acts, which would constitute its actual commission if it were not interrupted. The point at which such a series of acts begins cannot be defined; but depends upon the circumstances of each particular case\". While the first sentence is an attempt at defiuing 'attempt', the second sentence is a confession of inability to define. The attempt at definition fails precisely at the point where it shonld be helpful. See the obser- vations of Parker C.J. in Davey v. Lee(') and of Prof. Glanville Williams in his essay on 'Police Control of intending criminals' in 1955 Criminal Lmv Review. Another attempt at definition was made by PtQfessor Turner in [1934] 5 Cambridge Law Journal' 230, and this was substnntially repro- duced in 'Archbald's Crimlnal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (36th &Jn.). Archbald's reproduction was quoted with approval in Davey v. Lee(\") and was as follows : , ' .......... '. . the actus reus necessary to constitute an attempt is complete if the prisoner does an act which is a step towards the commission of a specific crime, which is immediately and not merely remotely connected with the commission of it, and the doing of which cannot reasonably be regarded as having any other purpose• than the commis- sion of the specific crime\". We must at once say that it was not noticed in Archbald's (36th Edn.) nor was it brought to the notice of the DivisiQrla] Court which A. B c D E F G · decided Davey v. Lee (supra) that Prof. Turner was himself not satis- H fied with the definition propounded by him and felt c;o'mpelled to (l) [1968]! Q. B. 366. 2&--138 SCl/80 1168 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1980] 2 s.c.R. A modify it, as he thought that to require that the act could not reasonably be regarded as having any other purpose then the commission of the specific crime went too far and it sho~ld be sufficient \"to show prima facie' the offender's intention to commit the crime which he is charged with attempting\". B Editing 12th edition of Russell on Crime and 18th edition of Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law, Professor Turner explained his modified definition as follows: \"It is therefore suggested that a practical test for the actus reus in attempt is that the prosecution must prove that c the steps taken by the accused must have reached the point when they themselves clearly indicate that was the end towards which they were directed. In other words the steps taken must themselves be sufficient to show, prima facie, the offender's intention t,o commit the crime which he is charged with attempting. That there may be abundant other evidence D to establish his mens rea (such as a confession) is irrelevant to the question of whether he had done enough to constitute the actus reus\".(I) We must say here that we are unable to see any justification for e!!:clu- ding evidence aliunde on the question of mens rea in considering what E constitutes the actus reus. That would be placing the actus reus in too narrow a pigeon-hole. In Haughten v. Smith,(') Hai/sham L. C. quoted Parke B from the Eagleton case (supra) and Lord Parker, C.J. from Davey v. Lee (supra) and proceeded to mention three propositions as emerg- F ing from the two definitions : G H \"(1) There is a distinction between the intention to commit a crime and an attempt to commit it. .......... . (2) In addition to the intention, or mens rea, there must be an overt act of such a kind tha~ it is intended, to form and does form part of a series of acts which would constitute the actual commission of the offence if it were not inter- rupted. . . . . . . . . . ( 3) The act relied on as constituting the attempt must not be an act merely preparatory to commit the completed offence, but must bear a relationship to the completion of the offence referred to in Reg. v. Eagleton, as being 'proximate' tci the completion of the offence in (l) Russell on Crimes (12th Elin.) edited by Prof. Tarner, P. 184. (2) [1975] A. C. 476 at 492. x • 1- -< \\ r • MAHARASHTRA v. MOHD. YAKUB (Chinnappa Reddy, !.) 1169 Davey v. Lee [1968) 1 Q.B. 366, 370, as being 'imme- A diately and not merely remotely connected' with the com- pleted offence ........... \" I In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Stonehouse, ( 1) Lord Dip- lock a'nd Viscount Dilhome, appeared to accept the 'proximity' test of Parke B, while Lord Edmund-Davies accepted the statement of Lord Hailsham as to what were the true ingredients of a criminal attempt. Whatever test was applied, it was held that the facts clearly dis-· closed an attempt in that case. Ill India, while attempts to commit certain specified offences have themselves been made specific olfonces (e.g. 307, 308 Indian Penal Code etc.), an attempt to commit an offence punishable under the Penal Code; generally, is dealt with under section 511 Indian Penal Code. But the expression 'attempt' has not bee'n defined anywhere. In Abhayanand Mishra v. The State of Bihar,(') Raghubar Dayal and Subba Rao, JJ., disapproved of the test of 'last act which if un- interrupted and successful would constitute a criminal offence' and summarised their views as follows : \"A person commits the offence of 'attempt to commit a particular offence' when (i) he intends to commit that parti- cular offence; and (ii) he, having made preparations and with the intention to commit the offence, does an act to- wards its commission; such an act need not be the penulti- mate act towards the commission of that offence but must be an act during the course of committing that offence\". In Malkiat Singh & Anr v. State of Punjab,( 3) a truck which was carrying paddy, was stopped at Samalkha 32 miles from Delhi and about 15 miles from the Delhi-Punjab boundary. The question was whether the accused were attemJ?ting to export paddy from Punjab to Delhi. It was held that on the facts of the case, the offence of attempt had not been committed. Ramaswamy. J., observed : \"The test for determining whether the act of the appel- lants constituted an attempt or preparation is whether the overt acts already done are such that if the offender changes his mind and does not proceed further in its progress, the acts already done would be completely harmless. In the present case it is quit~ possible that the appellants may have (1) (1977] 2 All E. R. 909. (2) (1962] 2 S.C.R. 241at253, (3) (1969] 2 S.C.R. 663 at 667. B c D E F G H 1170 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1980] 2 S.C.R. Ii been warned that they had no licence to carry the paddy and they may have changed their mind at any place bet- \\'leen Samalkha barrier and the Delhi-Punjab boundary and not have proceeded further in their journey\". B c D E F G ·e We think that the test propounded by the first, sentence should be understood with reference to the facts of the case. The offence alleged to be coutemplated was so far removed from completion in that case that the offender had yet ample time and opportunity to change his mind and proceed no further, his earlier acts being com· pletely harmless. That was what the Court meant, and the reference to 'the appellants' in the sentence where the test is propounded makes it clear that the test is propounded with reference to the partieular facts of the case and not a~ a general rule. Otherwise, in every case where an accused is interrupted at the last minute from completing the offence, he may always say that when he was interrupted he was· about to change his mind. Let me now state the result of the search and research : In order to constitute 'an attempt', first, there must be an intention to commit a particular offence, second, some act must have been done which would necessarily have to be done towards the commission of the offence, and, third, such act must be 'proximate' to the intended result. The measure of proximity is nOt in relation to time and· action but in relation to intention. In other words, the act must reveal, with reasonable certainty, in conjunction with other !acts and· circumsta'nces and not necessarily in isolation, an intention, as distin- guished from a mere desire or object, to commit the particular off- ence, th9ugh the act by itself may be merely suggestive or indicative of such intention; but, that it must be, that is, it must be indicative. or suggestive of the intention. For instance, in the instant case, had the truck been stopped and searched at the very commencement of the journey or even at Shirsad Naka, the discovery of silver ingots m the truck might at the worst lead to the inference that the accused· had prepared or were preparing for the commission of the offence. It could be said that the accused were transporting or attempting to transport the silver somewhere hut it would not necessarily suggest or indicate that the intention was to export silver. The fact that the truck was driven upto a lonely creek from where the silver could be transferred into a sea-faring vessel was suggestive or indicative though not conclusive, that the accused wanted to export the silver. It might have been open to the accused to plead that the silver was • • ? r MAHARASHTRA v. MOHD. YAKUB (Chinnappa Reddy, J.) 1171 not to be exported but only !o be transported in the. course of inter- A coastal trade. But, the circumstance that all this was done in a clandestine fashiob, at dead of night, revealed, with reasonable cer- tainty, the intention of the accused that the silver was to be exported. In the result I agree with the order proposed by Sarkaria, J . B P.B.R.' Appeal allowed.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
