SUPREME COURT REPORTS 95 To establish a charge under s. 201, Iudia.n Penal Code, it is 1952 essential to prove that an offence has been committed (mere sus- picion that it has been committed is not sufficient); that the accus2d Palvinder Kaur knew or had reason to believe that such offence had been Mmmit- v. · ted ; and that with the requisite knowledge and with the intent to The State of screen the offender from legal punishment the accused caused the Punjab. evidence thereof to disappear or gave false information respecting such offence knowing or having reason to believe the same to be false. Where the evidence showed that a person had died, that his body was found in a trunk and was dis'COvered in a well and that the accused took part,in the disposal of the body but there was no evidence to show the cause of his death or the manner or circum- stances in which it came about: Held, that the accused could not be convicted for an offence under s. 201. A statement that contains self-exculpatory matter cannot amount to a confession, if the exculpatory matter is of some fact, which if true would negative the offence alleged to be confessed. A confession must either admit in terms the offence or at any rate substantially all the facl(s that constitute the offeuce. Narayanaswami v. Emperor (1939) 66 I.A. 66, referred to. It is a well accepted rule regarding the use of confessions an<l admissions that these must either be accepted as a whole or reject- ed as a whole and that the court is not competent to accept only the inculpll.tory part while rejecting the exculpatory part as inher- ently incredible. Emperor v. Bal!nmkand (1930) I.L.R. 52 All. 1011, followed. Where the statement made by the accused contained an admission that she had placed the dead body of her husband in a trunk and had carried it in a jeep and thrown it into a well, but with regard to the, cause of the death the statement made by her was that her husband hp.d accidently ta.ken a poisonous substance which was meant for washing photos erroneously thinking it to be a medicine: Held, the statement read as a whole was exculpatory in character and the whole statement was inadmissible in evidence and the High Court acted erroneously in accepting the former part of it and rejecting the latter part as false.

'rhe judgment of the Court was de Ii vered by MAHAJAN J.-Pa\\vinder Kaur, was tried for offences under sections 302 and 201, Indian Penal Code, in connection. with the murder of her husband, Jaspal Singh. She was convicted by the Ses.sions Judge under section 302 and sentenced to transportation for life. No verdict was recorded regarding the charge under section 201, Indian Penal Code. On appeal to the High Court she was acquitted of the charge of murder, but was convicted under section 201, Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to seven yearn' rigorous imprisonment. Her appeal by special leave is now before us. J aspal Singh, deceased, was the son of the.Chief of Bhareli (Punjab). He was married to Palvinder Kaur a few years ago and they had two children. The husband and wife were living together in.Bhareli house, Ambala. It is said that J aspal's relations with his father and grandfather, were not very cordial and the two elders thought that Palvinder Kaur was res- ponsible for this. It is also said that .Jaspal lived on the allowance he got from his father and supple- mented his income by selling milk and eggs and by doing some odd jobs. Mohinderpal Singh (a fugitive from justice) who is related to the appellant and was employed as a stornkeeper in Baldevnaga1· Camp, Ambala, used occasionally to reside in Bhareli house. It is suggested that he hacl started a liaison with Palvinder. The prosecution case is that Sardar Jaspal was administered potassium ·cyanide poison by the appel- lant and Mohinderpal on the afternoon of the 6th February, 1950. The dead body was then put into a large trunk and kept in one of the rooms in the house in Ambala city. About ten days kt er, i.e., on the . j S.0.R.

The trunk was then taken to Baldev- . Punjab. nagar Camp and was kept in a store room there. Three days later, on the 19th February, 1950, Mohinderpal :t;Iaha.ian J. accompanied by Palvinder and a domestic servant, Trilok Chand tP. vV. 27), took the trunk a few miles on the road leading to Rajpura, got on to a katcha road and in the vicinity of village Chhat took the jeep to a well 011 a mound a,ud threw the box into it. The jeep was taken to a gurdwara where it was washed. After the disappearance of the deceased, his father made enquiries from Mohinderpal regarding the whereabouts of his missing son. .Mohinderpal made various false statements to him. On the 8th March, 1950, the father advertised in the \"Daily Tul:ilap\" beg~ _., ging his son to return home as soon as possible as the condition of his wife and children and parents had become miserable owing to his absence. On the 10th March, 1950, i.e., a month -and ten ilays after the alleged murder and 19 days after the trunk was thrown into the well, obnoxious smell was · corning out of the well, and the matter being reported to the lambardars of village Chhat, the trunk was taken ont. The matter was reported to the police and Sardar Banta Singh, Sub-Inspector of ,Police, on the 11th March arrived at the scene and prepared the inquest report and sent for the doctor. The post- mortem examination was performed on the spot the next day. No photograph of the body was taken and it was allowed to be cremated. After more than two and a half months, on the 28th April, 1950, the first information report was lodged against the appellant . and Mohinderpal a,nd on the 26th June a challan was presented in the court of the committing magistrate. Mohinderpa I was not traceable and the case was started. against the appellant alone. 98 SUPREMI<1 COURT REPORTS [1953). 1952 There is no direct evidence to establish that the , . -d K. appellant or Mohinderpal or both of them adminis- Pa'\"'\" er aur d t . . d J l d h . d v. tere po assmm cyam e to aspa an t e ev1 ence The State of regar'iling the murder is purely circumstantial. The , Punjab. learned Sessions Judge took the view that the circum- stantial evidence in the case was incompatible with MahaJaii J. the innocence of the accused, and held that the case against the appellant was proved beyond any reason- able doubt. The High Court on app·eal arrived at a different conclusion. It held that though the body found from the well was not capable of identification, the clothes recovered from the trunk and found on the body proved that it was the body of J aspal. It further held that the cause of death could not be ascertained from the medical evidence given in the case. The evidence on the question of the identity of the dead body consisted of the statement of constable I.achhman Singh, of the clothes and other articles recovered from inside the trunk and of an alleged confession of the accused. As regards the firnt piece of evidence the High Court expressed the following opinion: - '\"l1here is in our opinion considerable force in the contention that not only are foot constable r~achhman Singh and Assistant Sub-Inspector Banta Singh testifying to the facts which are false to their know- . ledge bid that the proseciztion are responsible for deliber- ately introdiwing a false witness and for a.~king th~ other witnesses to su.pport the story narrated by Laohhman Singh· that he· identified the. body to be that of J aspal Singh on the 11th March and communicated the infor- mation to the father of the deceased on the following day.\" As regards the extra-judicial confessions alleged to h:i.ve been made to Sardar Rup Singh and Sarda1· Balwant Singh, father and grandfather of the de- ceased, they were held inadmissible and unreliable. 'The confession made by Palvinder to the magistrate on the 15th April, 1950, was however used in evid- ence against her on the.following reasoning:- \"It is true that strictly speaking exculpatory state- ments in which the prisoner denies her guilt cannot - - S.C.R.

It was also found that though Palvinder might have The State 01 desired to continue her illicit intrigue with Mohinder- Punjab. pal she may not have desired to sacrifice her wealth Mahaja\" J. and position at the altar of love. She may have had a motive to kill her husband but a stronger motive to preserve· her own position as the wife of a pro- spective chief of Bhareli and that iu th.is situation it was by no means impossible that the murder was committed by Mohinderpal alone without the consent and knowledge of Palvinder, and that though a strong suspicion attached to Palvinder, it was impossible to state with confidence that poison was administered by her. Therefore it was not possible to convict her under section 302, Indian Penal Code. Concerning the charge under section 201, Indian Penal Code, the High Court held that the most import- ant piece of evidence in support of the charge was the confession which Palvinder madG on the 15th April, 1950, and this confession, though retracted, was corro- borated on this point by independent evidence and established the charge. The judgment of the High Court was impugned before us on a large number of grounds. Inter alia, it was contended that in examining Palvinder Kaur at great length the High Court contravened the provi- sions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the Full Bench decision of the High Court in Dhara Sing h's oase(1) was wrong in law, that the alleged confession of the appellant being an exculpatory statement, the same was inadmissible in evidence and could not be used as evidence against her, that it had been contradicted in most material particulars by the prosecution evid- ence itself and was false and that in any case it could not be used piecemeal; that the offences under sec- tions 302/34 and 201, Indian Penal Code, being distinct offences committed at two different times and bein~ • 100 SUPREME COURT REPOR'rS [1953] w52 separate transactions, the appellant having been con- p l .-d K victed of·the offence under section 802, Indian Penal a v·in er .aur . . v. Code, only by the Sess10ns Judge, the High Court had The state of no jurisdiction when acquitting her of that offeJlCe to Pun.jab. convict her under section 201 of the same Code; that the statements of Mohinderpal to various witnesses ''fohajan. .r. and his conduct were not relevant against the appel- lant ; .that Karamchand and Mst. I.achhmi were in the naturn of accomplices and the High· Court erred in relying on their testimony withont any corrobora· tion; that the\"High Court having disbelieved eight of the witnesses of the prosecution and having held that \"they were falsely introduced into the case, the investi- gation being extremely belated and the story having been developed at different stages, the High Court should not have relied on the same; and lastly that the pieces of circumstantial evidence proved against the appellant were consistent with several innocent explanations and the High Court therefore erred in relying on them without excluding those possi- bilities. ' The decision of the appeal, in our view, lies within a very narrow compass and it is not necessary to pro- nounce on all the points that were argued before us. In our judgment, there is no evidence to establish • affirmatively that the death of Jaspal was caused by potassium cyanide and that being so, the charge under section 201, Jndian Penal Code, must ~!so fail. The High Court in. reaching a contrary conclusion not only acted on suspicions and conjectures but on inadmissible evidence. 'I'he circumstances in which J as pal died will for ever remain· shrouded in mystery and on the material placed on the record it is not possible to unravel them. It may well be that he was murdered by Mohinderpal without the knowledge or consent of Palvinder and the incident took place at Baldevnagar Camp and not at the house and that Mohinderpal alone disposed of the dead body and that the conies: sion of Palvinder is wholly false and the advertise- )Ilent issued in \"Milap\" correctly refle(lted the facts - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 101 so far as she was concerned. The evidence led by the 1952 Prosecution, however, is \"Of such a character that no P 1 . -d K . b l d .t d ffi . a vin er aur. rehance can e p ace on 1 an no a rmat1ve .con- v. clusions can be drawn from it. The remarks of the The State of Sessions Judge, that the consequences had definitely Punjab. revealed that justice could not always be procured by wealth and other worldly resources and that the case Mahajan J: would perhaps go down in hi~ory .as one of the most sensational cases because of the parties involved and the gruesome waYin which the murder was committed, disclose a frame of mind not necessarily judicial. It was unnecessary to introduce sentimentalism in a judicial decision. The High Court was not able to reach a positive conclusion that Palvinder was res- ponsible for the iirnrder of her husband. Whether J aspal committed suicide or died of poison taken under a mistake or whether poison was adminis- tered to. him by the appellant or by Mohinderpal or by both of them are questions the· answers to which have been left very vague and indefinite by the circum- stantial evidence in the case. In view of the situa- tion of the parties and t'he belated investigation of the case and the sensation it created, it was absolutely necessary for the courts below to safeguard them- selves against the danger of basing their conclusions on suspicions howsoever strong. It seems to us that the trial court, and to a certain extent the High Court, fell into the same error against which warning was given by Baron Alderson in Reg. v. Hodge(1), where he said as follows:- \"The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force thein to form parts of one connected whole; and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, considering such matter,;, to overreach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that is wanting, to take for granted some fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them complete.\" (I) (x838) 2 Lew. 227.

From hunting whatever skins (khalls) he brought home he became fond of colouring them. He also began to do the work of . washing of photos out of eagerness. One day in December, 1949, J asp al Singh said to my cousin (Tay's son) Mohinderp~l Singh to get him material for washing photos. He(Mohinderpal Singh) said to Har- nam Singh, who is head clerk in Baldevnagar. Camp, to bring the same from the Cantt. Harnarn Singh went to the Oantt. and on return said that the material for washing photos could be had only by a responsible Government official. He told so to Mohinderpal Singh, who said that Harnam Singh should take his name and get the medicine. 'l'hereupon Har- nam Singh went to the Oaatt. and brought the medicine. I kept this medicine. As the medicine was sticking to the paper I put it in wa~er in a small bottle and kept it· in the almirah. In those days my husband was in Ambala and I lived with him in the kothi in the city. He went for hunting for 2-3 days and there he develop- ed abdominal trouble and began to purge. He sent for medicine 3-4 days from Dr. Bohan Singh. One day I placed his medicine bottle in the almirah where medicine for washing photos had been placed. I was sitting outside and Jaspal Singh enquired from me where his medicine was. I told him that it was in the almirah. By mistake he took that medicine which was meant for washing photos. At that time, he fell down and my little son was standing by his side. He said 'Mama, Papa had fallen'. I went inside and saw that he was in agony and in short time be expired. Thereafter I went to Mohinderpal Sin$h io4 SUPREME COURT .

For 4-5 days Mahajan J. the box remained in mY kothi. Thereafter I said to Mohinderpal Singh that if he did not help me I would die. He got removed that box from my kothi with the help of my servants and placing the same in his jeep went to his store in Baldevnagar Camp and kept 'the same there. That box remained there for 8-10 · days. Thereafter one day I went to the camp and from there got placed the ti'unk in the jeep and going with Mohinderpal Singh I threw the same in a well near Chhat Banur. I do not remember the date when .faspal Singh took t.he medicine by mistake. It was perhaps in January, 1\"950.\" The statement read as a whole is of au exculpatory character. It does not suggest or prove the commis- sion of any offence under the Indian Penal Code by any one. It not only exculpates her from the com- .mission of an offence but also exculpates Mohinderpal It states that the death of J as pal was accidental. 'l'he statement does not amount to a confession and is thus inadmissible in evidence. It was observed by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Naraya?ia- swami v. E1nperor(1) that the word \"confession\" as used in the Evidence Act cannot be construed as meaning a statement by an accused suggesting the inference that he committed the crime. A confession must either admit in terms the offence, or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the offence. An admission of a gravely incriminat- ing fact, even a conclusively incriminating fact, is not of itself a confession. A statement that contains self-exculpatory matter cannot amount to a confes- sion,· if the exculpatory statement is of some fact, which if true, would negative the. offence alleged to be confessed. In this view of the law the High Court . (1) (1939) ~6 I.A. 66; A.LR. 1939 P.C. 47. • S.C.R.

The ·learned Judges in one part of · their Th• s1:1. of judgment observed that strictly, speaking exculpatory Punjab. statements in which the prisoner denies her guilt · .. cannot be regarded as confessions, but went on to say Mahajan J. that such statements are often used as circumstantial evidence of guilty consciousness by showing them to be false . and fabricated. With great respect we have not been able to .follow the meaning of these observations and the learned counsel appearing at the Bar for the prosecution was unable to explain what these words exactly indicated. The statement. not . being a confession and being of an exculpatory nature . in which the guilt had been denied by the prisoner, it could not be used as evidence in the case to ·prove . her guilt. · , . Not only was the High Court in error in treating the alleged confession of Palvinder as evidence in the case but it was further in error in accepting a part of it after finding that the rest of it was false. It said that the statement that the deceased took poison by mistake should be ruled out of consideration for the - simple reason. that . if the decea.sed had taken poison by mistake the conduct of the parties would have been completely ·different; and that she would have then .• run to his side and raised a hue and cry and would• have sent immediately for medical aid; that it was' • .· incredible that if the deceased had taken poison by ' mistake, his wife would have stood idly by and allowed him to die: . The court thus accepted the inculpatory part of that statement and rejected. the exculpatory part. In doing so it contravened the well accepted rule regarding the use of confession and admission that these must either be accepted as a whole or - rejected a.s a whole and that the court is not com- petent to accept only the inculpatory part· while -· rejecting the exculpatory part as inherently inc!edible. Reference in tr.is connection may be made to-the observations of the Full Bench of the Alla.ha.bad 106 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1953] 1952 High Court in Emperor v.

'l'he answer to the reference was that where t.here is no other evidence to show affirmatively that any portion of the exculpatory element in the cort- fession is false, the court must accept or reject the confession as a whole and cannot accept only the • inculpatory element while rejecting the exculpatory· element as inherently incredible. 'l'he alleged con- fession of Palvinder is wholly of an exculpatory nature and does not admit the commission of any crime whatso_ever. The suspicious circumstances from which an inference of guilt would be drawn were cl!n- tained in that part of the statement which concerned the disposal of the dead body. '!'his part of the state- ment could not be used as evidence by holding that the first part which was of an exculpat_ory character was false when there was no evidence to prove that it was so, and the only material on which \\t could be so held was the conduct mentioned in the latter part. of the same statement and stated to be inconsistent with the earlier part of the confession. 'l'he result therefore is that no use can be made of the statement mad~ by Palvinder and contained in the alleged confession and which the High Court thought was the most important piece of evidence in the case to prove that the death of J aspal was caused by poisoning or as a result of an offence having been. committed. Once this confession is excluded alto- gether, there remains no evi_dence for holding tha.t Jaspal died as a result' of the administration of potas- sium cyanide. (J) (1930) l.L.R. 52 All. IO!l. - - S.O.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 107 The circumstantial evidence referred to by the 1952 High Court which according to it tends to es~ablish Palvinder Ka\"r that Jaspal did not die a natural death is of the v. following nature: 'rhat Palvinder and Mohinderpal The State of had a motive to get rid of the deceased as she was P\"njab. carrying on with Mohinderpal. The motive, even if . Mahajan J. proved in the case, cannot prove the circumstances under which J aspal died or the cause which resulted in his death. That Mohinderpal was proved to be in possession of a quantity of potassium cyanide and was in a position to administer it to the deceased is a cir- cumstance of a neutral character. Mere possession of potassium cyanide by M ohinderpal without its being traced in the body of J asp al cannot establish that his death was caused by this deadly poison. In any case, the circumstance is not of a character which is wholly incompatible with the innocence of the appellant. The other evidence referred to by the High Court as corroborating the latter part of Palvinder's alleged confession in the view of the case that we ha:ve taken does not reg uire any discussion because if the confession is inadmissible, no question of corro- borating it arises. Mr. Sethi argued that the statements contained in the alleged confession are contradicted rather than corroborated by the evidence led by the prosecution and that the confession is proved to be untrue. It is unnecessary to discU3s this matter in the view that we ha~e taken of the case. The result, therefore, is that we are constrained to hold that there is no material, direct or indirect, for the finding reached by the High Court that the death of J aspal was caused by the administration of potas- sium cyanide. If we believe the defence version his death was the result of an accident. If that version is disbelieved, then there is no proof as to the cause of his death. The method and manner in which the dead body of J asp al was dealt with and disposed of 1'1d.ille \\lome suspicion but from these facts a positive conclusion cannot be reached .that he died an un- natural death necessarily.
