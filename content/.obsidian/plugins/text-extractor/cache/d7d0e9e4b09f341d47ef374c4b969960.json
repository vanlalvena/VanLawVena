Criminal Trial - Circumstantial Evidence - Conviction on basis of - Principles reiterated The issues that arose before the Supreme Court were: (i) Whether the testimony of sole child eyewitness (PW 5) was completely worthy of reliance and going by the rule of prudence, the version given by him was fully corroborated on material particulars so as to be sufficient to base conviction of the appellant thereon? (ii) Whether in prosecution under Section 396 IPC, liability of accused persons could be fastened with the help of only fingerprint expert's report? Allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court Held: Issue (i): Testimony of sole child eyewitness The evidence of the child witness cannot be rejected per se, but the court, as C d a rule of prudence, is required to consider such evidence with close scrutiny and only on being convinced about the quality of the statements and its reliability, base e conviction by accepting the statement of the child witness. If the child witness is shown to have stood the test of cross-examination and there is no infirmity in her evidence, the prosecution can rightly claim a conviction based upon her testimony alone. Corroboration of the testimony of a child witness is not a rule but a measure of caution and prudence. Some discrepancies in the statement of a child witness cannot be made the basis for discarding the testimony. Discrepancies in f the deposition, if not in material particulars, would lend credence to the testimony of a child witness who, under the normal circumstances, would like to mix up what the witness saw with what he or she is likely to imagine to have seen. While appreciating the evidence of the child witness, the courts are required to rule out the possibility of the child being tutored. In the absence of any allegation regarding tutoring or using the child witn e ss for ulterior purposes of the prosecution, the g courts have no option but to rely upon the confidence inspiring testimony of such witness for the purposes of holding the accused guilty or not. The evidence of the child witness must be evaluated more carefully and with greater circumspection because a child is susceptible to be swayed by what others tell him and thus an easy prey to tutoring. The evidence of the child witness must find adequate corroboration before it is relied upon, as the rule of corroboration is of practical wisdom than of h law.

Ashok Dixit, (2000) 3 SCC 70 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 579, cited The points on which the testimony of child witness, PW 5 U gets corroborated by other pieces of material or evidence on record are: According to him, a call was received on mobile of his mother, whereafter she opened the door and let the accused in. The mobile of his mother definitely received a call at about 9.27 p.m. from another mobile. The call lasted for 20 seconds. However, there is nothing on record that the mobile concerned was that of accused H, or any of the accused. The record does not throw any light, nor were any efforts made by the investigating machinery to trace the name of the person holding this mobile phone number. However, there is some corroboration available from the testimony of PW 2 OS that on 28-10-2008 he had found H standing near a vehicle in the vicinity of the house of the deceased; and upon being asked, accused H had replied that he was calling N (deceased). However, according to PW 2 OS, that was at about 11.00 p.m. and not at or about 9.27 p.m. (Para 23.1.1) After being admitted into the house, tea and water was offered to accused H and his associates. There were glasses which were found in the kitchen which fact certainly corroborates the version given by PW 5 U. (Para 23.1.2) It was stated that his mother was overpowered by two of the accomplices and her throat was slit by accused H. Thereafter, his three siblings were throttled to death, and an attempt was also made to throttle PW 5 U. The manner in which his mother and siblings were done to death is corroborated by the medical evidence on record. However, if the mother was being overpowered, there were no signs of struggle and none of her bangles was broken. Further, if her throat was slit and her left side blood vessels of the neck and trachea were cut, the blood would have instantaneously gushed out. But, there were no blood spots anywhere else except below the cot where the body of N was found lying in supine condition. One more striking feature of the matter is that there was no medical evidence either in the form of any documents, pictures or even a statement of any medical professional that PW 5 U was given medical attention as a result of attempts of throttling. (Para 23.1.3) The location of dead bodies, as mentioned by him, is undoubtedly corroborated by the site map, inquest panchnama and other material. (Para 23.1.4) Having dealt with the features which get corroborated to some extent, there are certain inconsistencies or infirmities which are evident from the record. (Para 24) According to PW 5 U, in the morning of 29-10-2008, the first person to see him was PW 4 SL (milkman), who took him to the house of his doctor uncle (Dr S). However, according to his statement recorded during investigation, he was taken to the house of his uncle by the neighbours. (Para 24.1) According to his court statement, after reaching the house of said uncle, he had narrated the entire incident to his other uncle PW 1 KS and said Dr SS and told them that H and his associates had committed the murders and also told them that he ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

According to the reporting, the accused were unknown persons. The reporting also did not disclose that PW 5 U had survived, despite being attempted to be murdered, and that he had witnessed the incident. As a matter of fact the FIR did not make any reference to PW 5 U. (Para 24.2) According to PW 5 U, he had narrated the entire incident to PW 4 SL (milkman) and Darogaji. On this score also, the record spoke otherwise, according to which, till 29-10-2008 the names of Hand his associates had not surfaced as suspects at all. The initial registration of crime was against unknown persons. (Para 24.3) There are other inconsistencies and omissions with regard to the manner in which his siblings were done to death. (Para 24.4) Apart from the aspects referred to hereinabove touching upon the comparison of the version given in court, as against his statement recorded during investigation, certain other features are available from the record which must be noted at this a b stage. (Para 25) c If PW 5 U was attempted to be murdered and as disclosed by PW 4 SL (milkman) he had seen a ligature mark on the neck of PW 5 U, there was nothing on record supporting this fact. (Para 25.1) Parcha No. 2 which was part of papers pertaining to investigation, did make a reference to the statement of PW 5 U recorded during investigation. However, as stated by PW 10 SOG, the said parcha was not in his handwriting, though, he d was incharge of investigation. He could not give any answer as to who had written that parcha. (Para 25.2) If according to the prosecution, PW 4 SL was the first person to reach the place of occurrence, his statement was recorded 26 days after the incident. The response given by the investigating officer concerned shows that no attempts were made to trace said SL. (Para 25.3) e The versions given by PW 1 KS and PW 4 SL in court did not, in any way, suggest that the names of suspects were narrated to them by PW 5 U, or that he had told them about the entire incident. As a matter of fact, PW 1 KS went to the extent of asserting that it was through Dr SS that he came to know about the incident. (Para 25.4) Thus, the version given by PW 5 U that he had narrated the entire incident to f PW 1 KS, PW 4 SL and Darogaji was not supported by any of them. Moreover, the other person, namely, Dr SS to whom similar narration was given by PW 5 U, was not even examined by the prosecution. (Para 25.5) The charge-sheet did indicate Dr SS to be one of the relevant witnesses, and yet he was not examined. On the other hand, the charge-sheet did not even speak of PW 5 U to be a relevant and material witness. (Para 25.6) g Having culled out the essential features emerging from the record, it is difficult to place reliance upon the testimony of PW 5 U and the said version cannot be made the basis of conviction of H. It is true that the assertion made by him that H used to be a tenant in their house was supported by PW 2 OS. Even if the Supreme Court accepts that accused H was a known face to PW 5 U, and the fact that the incident occurred inside the house where PW 5 U would naturally be available, but h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(Para 26) In the facts and circumstances of the case, the version given by the child witness in the instant case cannot be relied on, who was about five years of age when the incident had occurred. (Para 28) Digamber Vaishnav v. State of Chhattisgarh, (2019) 4 SCC 522 : (2019) 2 SCC (Cri) 300, followed Radhey Shyam v. State of Rajasthan, (2014) 5 sec 389 : (2014) 2 sec (Cri) 600, affirmed Suryanarayana V. State of Kamataka, (2001) 9 sec 129 : 2002 sec (Cri) 413, affinned in law but distinguished on facts Issue (ii): Whether in prosecution under Section 396 IPC, liability of accused persons could be fastened with the help of only fingerprint expert's report? Insofar as accused SY and SH are concerned, apart from the material that their sample fingerprints matched with those lifted from the house of the deceased, nothing was brought on record to suggest or suspect the involvement of said two accused. They were acquitted of the charges under Section 412 IPC and under the Arms Act. Whether their liability in the instant case can be fastened with the help of the fingerprint expert's report is the question. (Para 31) According to the record, Ext. Ka- 7 was the panchnama testifying the lifting of the fingerprints from the house of the deceased by constable DS. If the fingerprints were picked from the glasses there is nothing to indicate what method was applied to lift the fingerprints from the glasses allegedly used by the accused when they were offered water. What the record indicates is that some photographs were sent to the office of the Director, Fingerprint Bureau and nothing more. It does not show the procedure adopted for taking such photographs, and whether such method is a trusted and tested one. The person concerned was not examined, who could have thrown light on these issues. The record also does not show whether those glasses by themselves were made available for appropriate analysis. There is, thus, no clarity in the process adopted by the investigating machinery. (Para 32) The procedure detailed in the Kamataka Police Manual captures the importance of development and preservation as well as the method of packing and safe keeping. Such a procedure, if adopted, will not raise any doubts. Conduct of the investigating officer in keeping the material concerned with him for almost two months, was not approved by the Supreme Court. In the present case, Constable DS was not examined by the prosecution. There is nothing on record regarding the competence of said DS, and whether he was adequately trained, or was an expert in lifting the fingerprints from material such as glasses; nor was any evidence led detailing out the procedure adopted by him. In the absence of any such material, it is extremely difficult to rely on the report that the lifted fingerprints from the glasses matched with the sample fingerprints of accused SY and SH. (Para 34) In any case, apart from the fingerprints, there was nothing else on record against these two accused. One thing is clear that evidence of fingerprint expert is not substantive evidence. Such evidence can only be used to corroborate some items of substantive evidence which are otherwise on record. (Para 35) It is now settled law that in case of circumstantial evidence, all the incriminating facts and circumstances should be fully established by cogent and reliable evidence and the facts so established must be consistent with the guilt of the accused and should not be capable of being explained away on any other ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In short, the circumstantial evidence should unmistakably point to one and one conclusion only that the accused person and none other perpetrated the alleged crime. If the circumstances proved in a particular case are not inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and if they are susceptible of any rational explanation, no conviction can lie. (Para 36) It must be stated that both SY and SH were unknown faces to PW 5 U, and were not subjected to any test identification. Apart from identification by PW 5 U in Court for the first time, there is no other material to establish their presence. Thus, even if the Supreme Court accepts that fingerprints lifted from the house of the deceased could be associated with the said two accused, that by itself, in the absence of any substantive piece of evidence, cannot be made the basis of their conviction. These accused are therefore entitled to the benefit of doubt. (Para 37) Musheer Khan v. State of M.P., (2010) 2 SCC 748 : (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1100; Prakash v.

The trial court by its judgment dated 6-7-2015 accepted the case of prosecution against all six accused insofar as the offence punishable under Section 396 IPC was concerned. It, however, acquitted all the accused of the other offences with which they were charged. It was observed that no disclosure statement of the accused Harl Orn in relation to recovery of knife was recorded, and as such the requirement of Section 27 of the Evidence Act (\"the Act\", for short) were not satisfied, however, the recovery could still be admissible under Section 8 of the Act. It was also observed that there were certain omissions in the statement of Ujjawal recorded during investigation which were brought out in his cross-examination, but those omissions were not enough to reject his evidence. By its order dated 13-7-2015, sentences as quoted in para 1 hereinabove were imposed by the trial court. 19.

They were also not named by witness Ujjwal or any other witnesses. According to evidence against them, during investigation there was recovery and first time they were identified before the court by the witness Ujjwal along with other accused. It is also clear from the record that the appellant- accused appeared before the trial court on previous dates and on subsequent date, witness Ujjawal identified them. Hence, there was sufficient time and opportunity to identify them. No identification parade took place in the present case. The incident is of the year 2008 and after about three years they were identified by child witness Ujjawal first time before the court, hence, this evidence is doubtful. Considering the entire facts and circumstances, including the identification for the first time before the court, it is clear that the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond doubt against the appellants Haseen Khan, Rijwan and Bhaiye alias Farid alias Rafique and they are entitled for acquittal.\" l Hariom v.

His principal submissions were: 20.1. In the face of glaring inconsistencies in the version given by PW 5 Ujjawal and in the face of record as it stood, it would be extremely hazardous to accept the testimony of PW 5 Ujjwal and make it the basis of conviction of accused Harl Orn. 20.2. There was no link evidence suggesting that the fingerprints were correctly lifted from the house of the deceased, and were duly preserved before sending them for fingerprints expert's opinion. 20.3. The only material against accused Sanjay alias Sonu and Saurabh alias Sanju was the fact that their sample fingerprints tallied with those lifted from the house of the deceased. In the absence of any substantive evidence, this fact alone would be insufficient to sustain their conviction and sentence. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Musheer Khan v. State of M.P.3 20.4. Out of six named accused charged of having committed the offence of dacoity, three accused having being acquitted, whose acquittal was not challenged, the remaining three accused could not be convicted under Section 396 IPC. Reliance was placed on the decisions of this Court in Ram Shankar Singh v. State of U.P.4 and Saktu v. State of U.P.5 21. Ms Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing a b C d for the State, on the other hand, submitted that the testimony of PW 5 Ujjwal was completely worthy of reliance and that even going by the rule of prudence, version given by PW 5 Ujjwal was fully corroborated on material particulars. She relied upon the decisions of this Court in Suryanarayana v. State of Karnataka 6 , State of U.P. v. Krishna Master 7 and Manmeet Singh v. State of e Punjab 8 . 22. At the outset, we must note the perspective from which the evidence of a child witness is to be considered. The caution expressed by this Court in Suryanarayana 6 that \"corroboration of the testimony of a child witness is not a rule but a measure of caution and prudence\" is a well-accepted principle. While applying said principle to the facts of that case, this Court in Suryanarayana 6 observed: (SCC pp. 133-35, paras 5-9) \"5. Admittedly, Bhavya (PW 2), who at the time of occurrence was about four years of age, is the only solitary eyewitness who was rightly not given the oath. The time and place of the occurrence and the attending circumstances of the case suggest no possibility of there being any other person as an eyewitness.

La lit, J.) 369 such evidence with close scrutiny and only on being convinced about the quality of the statements and its reliability, base conviction by accepting the a statement of the child witness. The evidence of PW 2 cannot be discarded only on the ground of her being of tender age. The fact of PW 2 being a child witness would require the court to scrutinise her evidence with care and caution. If she is shown to have stood the test of cross-examination and there is no infirmity in her evidence, the prosecution can rightly claim a conviction based upon her testimony alone. Corroboration of the testimony b of a child witness is not a rule but a measure of caution and prudence. Some discrepancies in the statement of a child witness cannot be made the basis for discarding the testimony. Discrepancies in the deposition, if not in material particulars, would lend credence to the testimony of a child witness who, under the normal circumstances, would like to mix-up what the witness saw with what he or she is likely to imagine to have seen. While c appreciating the evidence of the child witness, the courts are required to rule out the possibility of the child being tutored. In the absence of any allegation regarding tutoring or using the child witness for ulterior purposes of the prosecution, the courts have no option but to rely upon the confidence inspiring testimony of such witness for the purposes of holding the accused guilty or not. d 6. This Court in Panchhi v. State of U.P.9 held that the evidence of the child witness must be evaluated more carefully and with greater circumspection because a child is susceptible to be swayed by what others tell him and thus an easy prey to tutoring. The evidence of the child witness must find adequate corroboration before it is relied upon, as the rule of corroboration is of practical wisdom than of law (vide Prakash v. State of e M.P. 10 ; Baby Kandayanathil v. State of Kerala 11 ; Raja Ram Yadav v. State of Bihar 12 and Dattu Ramrao Sakhare v. State of Maharashtra 13). 7.

If the knife is shown I can identify (a white cloth bag sealed, was opened). I have seen the knife now. With the same knife that day my uncle pierced my ammayi (this was marked as Ext. P-01) on that day. Police asked me as to what happened, I have told everything to the police.' 9. In her cross-examination the witness stated that before the date of occurrence the deceased was living with her (witness) parents. At the time of occurrence the witness used to go to Anganwadi school. The witness denied the suggestion that she had not gone with the deceased to wash the clothes. Nothing favouring the defence could be extracted out of her in the cross-examination. She denied the suggestion that 'my uncle did not pierce my aunt with the knife. It is not correct that I have not seen the knife in the hands of my uncle'. The trial court as well as the High Court accepted her testimony as no inherent defect was pointed out by the defence. We also find no reason to take a contrary view. The mere fact that her mother had told that she did not know any other language except Malayalam and that the words spoken to by her were not in that language cannot be used as a ground to reject her testimony. The child and her parents conversed in Malayalam language at their residence which was explained to the investigating officer in the language which was understood by him. There is no ground of doubting the veracity of the testimony of this child witness as we find that her name is mentioned in the FIR which is proved to have been recorded immediately after the occurrence. P.H. Krishnappa, the Tahsildar who prepared the inquest report is also proved to have recorded the statement of this child witness, wherein, she is shown to have made similar deposition. Otherwise also there is sufficient corroboration on record to rule out the possibility of PW 2 being tutored or used for ulterior purposes by some alleged interested persons. In the absence of any inherent defect we do not find any substance in the plea to reject the testimony of this child witness. The statement of PW 2 shows that the deceased and the appellant were living together as husband and wife and she used to address them as uncle and aunt. Her testimony to the effect of the deceased living with PW 1 is sufficiently corroborated by the other evidence led in the case. The factum of the deceased having received stabbed wound with a knife is proved by the medical evidence. The recovery of the knife at the instance of the appellant, in consequence of his disclosure statement, leaves no doubt to believe her statement. The place of occurrence being near the water tank has not been seriously disputed. The report received from FSL as per Ext. P-15 shows that blouse (MO 2), towel (MO 3) and the bangle pieces (MO 4) of the deceased and the knife (MO 1) which was used in the commission of the crime, the towel (MO 7), lungi (MO 6) and shirt (MO 5) of the appellant a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

We may now consider the evidence of PW 5 Ujjwal in the backdrop of the principles discernible from the decisions of this Court as stated above. 23.1. The points on which the testimony of PW 5 Ujjwal gets corroborated by other pieces of material or evidence on record are: 23.1.1. According to him, a call was received on mobile of his mother, whereafter she opened the door and let the accused in. The mobile of his mother bearing number 9411926017 definitely re cei ved a call at about 9.27 p.m. from a mobile bearing number 9758835941. The call lasted for 20 seconds. However, there is nothing on record that the mobile concerned was that of accused Harl Orn, or any of the accused. The record does not throw any light, nor were any efforts made by the investigating machinery to trace the name of the person holding this mobile phone number. However , there is some corroboration available from the testimony of PW 2 Ompal Singh that on 28-10-2008 he had found Hari Orn standing near a vehicle in the vicinity of the house of the deceased; and upon being asked, accused Hari Orn had replied that he was calling Smt Nirodh Devi. However , according to PW 2 Ompal Singh, that was at about 11.00 p.m. and not at or about 9.27 p.m. 23.1.2. After being admitted into the house, tea and water was offered to accused Hari Orn and his associates. There were glasses which were found in the kitchen which fact certainly corroborates the version given by PW 5 Ujjwal. 23.1.3. It was stated that his mother was overpowered by two of the accomplices and her throat was slit by accused Hari Orn. Thereafter, his three siblings w ere throttl ed to de ath, and an attempt was also made to throttle PW 5 Ujjwal. The manner in which his mother and sibling s were done to death is corroborated by the medical evidence on record. However, if the mother was being overpowered, there were no signs of struggle and none of her bangles was broken. Further, if her throat was slit and her left side blood vessels of the neck and trachea were cut, the blood would have instantaneously gushed out. But, there were no blood spots anywhere else except below the cot where the body of Smt Nirodh Devi was found lying in supine condition. One more striking feature of the matter is that there was no medical evidence either in the form of any documents, pictures or even a statement of any medical professional that PW 5 Ujjwal was given medical attention as a result of attempts of throttling. 23.1.4. The location of dead bodies, as mentioned by him, is undoubtedly corroborated by the site map, inquest panchnama and other material. 24. Having dealt with the features which get corroborated to some extent, we will now deal with certain inconsistencies or infirmities which are evident from the record. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

According to PW 5 Ujjwal, in the morning of 29-10-2008, the first person to see him was PW 4 Shankar Lal (milkman), who took him to the house of his doctor uncle (Dr Satyapal Singh). However, according to his statement recorded during investigation, he was taken to the house of his uncle by the neighbours. 24.2. According to his court statement, after reaching the house of said uncle, he had narrated the entire incident to his other uncle PW 1 Kotwal Singh and said Dr Satyapal Singh and told them that Hari Orn and his associates had committed the murders and also told them that he had witnessed the incident. However, the FIR lodged by PW 1 Kotwal Singh spoke otherwise. According to the reporting, the accused were unknown persons. The reporting also did not disclose that PW 5 Ujjwal had survived, despite being attempted to be murdered, and that he had witnessed the incident. As a matter of fact the FIR did not make any reference to PW 5 Ujjwal. 24.3. According to PW 5 Ujjwal, he had narrated the entire incident to PW 4 Shankar Lal (milkman) and Darogaji. On this score also, the record spoke otherwise, according to which, till 29-10-2008 the names of Harl Orn and his associates had not surfaced as suspects at all. The initial registration of crime was against unknown persons. 24.4. There are other inconsistencies and omissions with regard to the manner in which his siblings were done to death. 25. Apart from the aspects referred to hereinabove touching upon the comparison of the version given in court, as against his statement recorded during investigation, certain other features are available from the record which must be noted at this stage. 25.1. If PW 5 Ujjwal was attempted to be murdered and as disclosed by PW 4 Shankar Lal (milkman) he had seen a ligature mark on the neck of PW 5 Ujjwal, there was nothing on record supporting this fact. 25.2. Parcha No. 2 which was part of papers pertaining to investigation, did make a reference to the statement of PW 5 Ujjwal recorded during investigation. However, as stated by PW 10 S.O. Gautam, the said parcha was not in his handwriting, though, he was incharge of investigation. He could not give any answer as to who had written that parcha. 25.3. If according to the prosecution, PW 4 Shankar Lal was the first person to reach the place of occurrence, his statement was recorded 26 days after the incident. The response given by the investigating officer concerned shows that no attempts were made to trace said Shankar Lal. 25.4. The versions given by PW 1 Kotwal Singh and PW 4 Shankar Lal in court did not, in any way, suggest that the names of suspects were narrated to them by PW 5 Ujjwal, or that he had told them about the entire incident. As a matter of fact, PW 1 Kotwal Singh went to the extent of asserting that it was through Dr Satyapal Singh that he came to know about the incident. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Thus , the version given by PW 5 Ujjwal that he had narrated the entire incident to PW 1 Kotwal Singh, PW 4 Shankar Lal and Darogaji was not supported by any of them. Moreover, the other person, namely, Dr Satyapal Singh to whom similar narration was given by PW 5 Ujjwal, was not even examined by the prosecution. 25.6. The charge-sheet did indicate Dr Satyapal Singh to be one of the relevant witnesses, and yet he was not examined. On the other hand, the charge- sheet did not even speak of PW 5 Ujjwal to be a relevant and material witness. 26. Having culled out the essential features emerging from the record, we must state that we find it difficult to place reliance upon the testimony of PW 5 Ujjwal and in our view, the said version cannot be made the basis of conviction of Harl Orn. It is true that the assertion made by him that Harl Orn used to be a tenant in their house was supported by PW 2 Ompal Singh. Even if we accept that accused Harl Orn was a known face to PW 5 Ujjwal, and the fact that the incident occurred inside the house where PW 5 Ujjwal would naturally be available, but on the issue whether he had witnessed the incident, the glaring inconsistencies on record cannot be discarded. In Suryanarayana 6 after setting out the guiding principles for appreciation and consideration of the evidence of a child witness, this Court had found in para 9, that there were no doubts at all with regard to the veracity to the testimony of the child witness, nor were there any inherent defects. The name of the child witness figured in that case in the FIR and inquest; and right from the initial stages, her presence was adverted to, which is why no doubts could be entertained. However, such doubts and defects are quite evident in the present matter. 27. In Digamber Vaishnav v. State of Chhattisgarh 15, a Bench of three Judges of this Court, while considering the matter in the light of the fact that the child witness had not disclosed about the accused in the first instance, observed: (SCC p. 529, para 24) \"24 . ... None of the other witnesses have identified the appellants. Therefore, heavy reliance was placed on the testimony of PW 8. She did not tell PW 1, Badridas about the appellants while disclosing about the incident for the first time. This is reflected from the FIR which has been registered against unknown persons. In such circumstances, it is risky to rely on the uncorroborated identification of the appellants at the instance of PW 8, who has not disclosed about the appellants at the first instance before PW 1 Badridas.\" Similarly, in Radhey Shyam v. State of Rajasthan 16, the evidence of a child witness was not found to be inspiring confidence because of inconsistencies in the version of the witness, as well as because of the absence of corroboration from the other prosecution witnesses. h 6 Suryanarayana V.

In the circumstances, we do not find it safe to rely on the version given by the child witness in the instant case, who was about five years of age when the incident had occurred. 29. There are other features from the evidence touching upon the involvement of accused Harl Orn such as: 29.1. A chhuri or knife was said to have been recovered upon being pointed by accused Harl Orn. In the absence of any m emorandum, the trial court rejected the theory that such recovery would be admissible under Section 27 of the Act. It was, howe ver, observed that such recovery would be admissible under Section 8 of the Act. Though the conclusion arrived at by the trial court is not inconsistent with some of the decisions rendered by this Court, the evidence in that behalf, by itself may not be enough to sustain the finding of guilt. It will be one of the factors to be taken into account in the ultimate analysis. 29.2. Accused Hari Orn was seen in the neighbourhood, or near the house of Smt Nirodh Devi next to a red Tavera vehicle by PW 2 Ompal Singh and one Ram Prakash. During investigation, statement of on e Raju, owner of the house where accused Harl Orn resided, was also recorded. Ram Prakash and Raju were not examined during trial and, as such, apart from the statement of PW 2 Ompal Singh, we do not have any material to support the version that accused Hari Orn was either in the neighbourhood of Smt Nirodh Devi, or was moving about in a red Tavera vehicle on 28-10-2008. If the names of accused Hari Orn and his associates were not known as suspects to the police on 28-10-2008, which is the case of the prosecution , the link in that behalf has to be either through PW 2 Ompal Singh or through Ram Prakash or Raju. When latter two were not examined at all, we have to rely only on the testimony of PW 2 Ompal Singh. His cross-examination reveals that he made no attempts to talk to the police on 28-10-2008, though he asserted in his examination-in-chief that in the morning of28-10-2008 he was sure that the culprits were accused Hari Orn and his associates. The version given by PW 2 Ompal Singh is, therefore, not free from doubt. 29.3. The sample fingerprints of accused Hari Orn did not match with any of the fingerprints taken from the house of the deceased. 29.4. With the acquittal of all the accused in respect of offences punishable under Section 412 IPC and under the Arms Act, there is no other material pointing towards the involvement of accused Hari Orn. 30. Thus, out of three features which could possibly be put against accused Hari Orn, the version given by the child witness being unworthy to be relied upon, we are left with the evidence of recovery of a knife, and the evidence of PW 2 that he had spotted accused Harl Orn near a red Tavera vehicle in the neighbourhood. The prosecution did not attempt to prove that the call received by Smt Nirodh Devi could be associated with accused Harl Orn. Secondly, the time given by PW 2 Ompal Singh again did not match with the time of the call received by Smt Nirodh Devi.

In the premises, we do not find the material on record sufficient to record conviction of accused Harl Orn for the offence under Section 396 IPC, and he must be held entitled to benefit of doubt. 31. We now turn to the submissions (b) and (c) of Mr Marlapalle, learned Amicus Curiae. Insofar as accused Sanjay alias Sonu and Saurabh alias Sanju are concerned, apart from the material that their sample fingerprints matched with those lifted from the house of the deceased, nothing was brought on record to suggest or suspect the involvement of said two accused. They were acquitted of the charges under Section 412 IPC and under the Arms Act. Whether their liability in the instant case can be fastened with the help of the fingerprint expert's report is the question. 32. According to the record, Ext. Ka- 7 was the panchnama testifying the lifting of the fingerprints from the house of the deceased by constable Dharmender Singh. If the fingerprints were picked from the glasses there is nothing to indicate what method was applied to lift the fingerprints from the glasses allegedly used by the accused when they were offered water. What the record indicates is that some photographs were sent to the office of the Director, Fingerprint Bureau, Lucknow and nothing more. It does not show the procedure adopted for taking such photographs, and whether such method is a trusted and tested one. The person concerned was not examined, who could have thrown light on these issues. The record also does not show whether those glasses by themselves were made available for appropriate analysis. There is, thus, no clarity in the process adopted by the investigating machinery. 33. In Prakash v. State of Karnataka 17 , the evidence concerning fingerprints was examined in the light of the procedure prescribed under the relevant manual and it was observed: (SCC pp. 149-50, paras 33-37) \"33. Our attention was drawn to the Karnataka Police Manual and it appears that N anaiah followed the guidelines laid down therein and perhaps acted in an overly cautious manner. Guideline 1543 provides as follows: f '1543. The opinion of the fingerprint expert is of paramount importance in the investigation of various crimes. The following instructions should be followed regarding chance finger and footprints and their developments, preservation of the scene, method of packing and other matters:' 34. Guideline 1544 in the Manual contains various provisions and g clause (iv) and clause (v) are relevant for our purposes. They read as follows: h '1544.

( v) In sending the articles containing latent prints to the Bureau, proper a attention must be given to their package. The following essential points should be borne in mind: • It should be ensured that no portion of the article where prints may be found should get into contact with anything else; and • The articles should be securely packed in a suitable container.' Clause (iv) was clearly not followed when Nanaiah took the plastic cover along with him and this is an extremely serious lapse. However, we give him the benefit of doubt and assume that it is perhaps with clause (v) in mind that N anaiah took the plastic cover along with him. 35. While we completely disapprove of the manner in which Ext. P-18 was taken away by Nanaiah (and the investigating officer did nothing about it), the case of the prosecution does not get strengthened even if a valid procedure was followed, since there is nothing on record to show that the \"admitted\" fingerprints on Ext. P-20 were those of Prakash which could be compared with the fingerprints on Ext. P-18 and the enlarged photograph being Ext. P-19. 36. Assuming that Ext. P-20 was a valid piece of evidence validly obtained, there is no explanation why it was kept by the investigating officer from 14-11-1990 till 9-1-1991 when it was received by Nanaiah. The Karnataka Police Manual highlights the importance of keeping safe an article containing fingerprints. In view of its importance, N anaiah did not trust anyone with the plastic cover bearing the inscription \"Canara Bank\" (Ext. P-18) and carefully took it along with him to avoid its getting damaged by getting into contact with anything else. On the other hand, we have the investigating officer keeping Ext. P-20 with him for almost two months and in circumstances that seem unclear. We cannot rule out the possibility of Ext. P-20 getting damaged due to careless handling. 3 7. We are of the opinion that there is no fingerprint evidence worth it linking Prakash to the murder of Gangamma.\" 34. The procedure detailed in the Karnataka Police Manual captures the importance of development and preservation as well as the method of packing and safe keeping. Such a procedure, if adopted, will not raise any doubts. Secondly, in the aforesaid decision, the conduct of the investigating officer in keeping the material concerned with him for almost two months, was not approved by this Court. In the present case, constable Dharmender Singh was not examined by the prosecution. There is nothing on record regarding the competence of said Dharmender Singh, and whether he was adequately trained, or was an expert in lifting the fingerprints from material such as glasses; nor was any evidence led detailing out the procedure adopted by him.

In any case, apart from the fingerprints, there was nothing else on record against these two accused. It was observed by this Court in Musheer Khan v. State of M.P. 3 : (SCC pp. 757-58, para 34) \"34. It will be noticed that under the Evidence Act, the word \"admissibility\" has very rarely been used. The emphasis is on relevant facts. In a way relevancy and admissibility have been virtually equated under the Evidence Act. But one thing is clear that evidence of fingerprint expert is not substantive evidence. Such evidence can only be used to corroborate some items of substantive evidence which are otherwise on record.\" 36. In Hukam Singh v. State of Raja sthan 18 , the only circumstance against the accused concerned pertained to his fingerprints on a mirror. That circumstance by itself was not found to be sufficient by this Court to sustain the finding of guilt under Section 302 IPC against the accused. It was observed: (SCC pp. 102-103, paras 6 and 7) \"6. The last circumstance on which reliance was placed on behalf of the prosecution was the presence of fingerprints of the appellant on the mirror Ext. 1. We fail to see how this circumstance can be regarded as necessarily implicating the appellant in the commission of the murders. It was admitted by Sujan Singh that the appellant was on visiting terms with this family and it is, therefore, possible that during one of his visits, the appellant might have touched the mirror, Ext. 1 and left his fingerprints on it. It is also not altogether unlikely that even when the appellant was in the hutment of Sujan Singh for the purpose of committing the theft of ornaments and other articles belonging to Sujan Singh after the quadruple murders had been committed by some other persons, he might have touched the mirror, Ext. 1 and in the process left his fingerprints upon it. The presence of the fingerprints on the mirror, Ext. 1 is not such a circumstance as would necessarily lead to the inference that the appellant must have committed the murders of these four members of Sujan Singh's family. 7. It is now settled law that in case of circumstantial evidence, all the incriminating facts and circumstances should be fully established by cogent and reliable evidence and the facts so established must be consistent with the guilt of the accused and should not be capable of being explained away on any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. In short, the circumstantial evidence should unmistakably point to one and one conclusion only that the accused person and none other perpetrated the alleged crime.

Judged from this standpoint, it is not possible to affirm the conviction of the appellant for the offence of murder of any one or more of Bhanwar Singh, Roop Singh, Lad Kanwar and lnder Kanwar. The three circumstances relied upon by the prosecution are not incompatible with the innocence of the appellant insofar as the murders of these four persons are concerned. They are capable of being explained away on a hypothesis other than that of guilt of the appellant. We may point out that in any event the view taken by the Sessions Court that the circumstances were not su fficient to found the conviction of the appellant was a reasonable view and the High Court was not justified in reversing it.\" 37. It must be stated that both Sanjay alias Sonu and Saurabh alias Sanju were unknown faces to PW 5 Ujjwal, and were not subjected to any test identification. Apart from identification by PW 5 Ujjwal in Court for the first time, there is no other material to establish their presence. Thus, even if we accept that fingerprints lifted from the house of the deceased could be associated with the said two accused, that by itself, in the absence of any substantive piece of evidence, cannot be made the basis of their conviction. These accused are therefore entitled to the benefit of doubt. 38. Having come to the conclusion that all three appellants are entitled to benefit of doubt, we need not go into the fourth submission advanced by Mr Marlapalle , learned Amicus Curiae. 39. In the premises, we accept the appeals preferred by accused Harl Orn, Sanjay alias Sonu and Saurabh alias Sanju. While setting aside the orders of conviction and sentence recorded against them, we acquit them of all the charges levelled against them. They be set at liberty, unless their custody is required in connection with any other offence. 40. Before we part, we must record our appreciation for the sincere efforts put in by Mr B .H.
