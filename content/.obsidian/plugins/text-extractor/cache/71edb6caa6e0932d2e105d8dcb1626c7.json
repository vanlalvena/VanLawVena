This Original Reference under Section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) is sent by the Deputy Commissioner/Collector (South West) whereby opinion of this Court has been sought as to whether construction of a boundary wall around agricultural land which is governed by the Delhi Land Reforms Act,1954 (hereinafter referred to as „DLR Act‟) and Delhi Land O. R. No.1/2015 Page 2 of 16 Reforms Rules,1954 (hereinafter referred to as „DLR Rules‟) is or is not a prohibited activity under the provision of Section 81 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act or in other words whether the agricultural and relative activities which are specified in Section 81 do not include the work of construction of a boundary wall around agricultural land. 2. In order to appreciate and decide the issue, this Court will have to examine the relevant provisions of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, Delhi Land Reforms Rules, Delhi Land Revenue Act, 1954 and Delhi Land Revenue Rules, 1962.

When a mark of this class has altogether disappeared no steps shall be taken to replace it.” 3. The lands which are the subject matter of the DLR Act are those lands which fall within the definition of „land‟ contained in Section 3(13), and such lands include all types of lands in a village or O. R. No.1/2015 Page 9 of 16 rural area. Land in a village or rural area will have lands which are used for agricultural purposes and connected purposes, even abadi lands, lal dora lands which are used for industrial purposes, village pasture lands, gair mumkin pahari land etc. Therefore, it is not as if the land which is comprised in village or rural area only will mean agricultural land or that the DLR Act only applies to agricultural land. DLR Act applies to rural areas or village areas which fall within the jurisdiction of the DLR Act. 4. That the lands in a rural area or village area which is the subject matter of jurisdiction under the DLR Act also includes lands which are used for non-agricultural purposes becomes clear not only from the definition of „land‟ which will include abadi lands, but the same is also further made clear by the definition of the word „improvement‟ as found under Section 3(12) of the DLR Act. Improvement has been defined to include a dwelling house or other constructions for the purposes connected with agricultural and related activities, well, water channels, tanks and so on. Therefore, the irrefutable conclusion is that the lands which are the subject matter of the DLR Act will include all types of lands in a rural area or village O. R. No.1/2015 Page 10 of 16 i.e. an area which is not urbanized, either because of notification under Section 507 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 or that area which becomes a developed area for non-agricultural purposes because of being included in a developed area under Section 12 of the Delhi Development Act, 1957 vide Shri Neelpadmaya Consumer Products Pvt. Ltd. v. Satyabir and Ors. 227 (2016) DLT 654. 5. Section 22 of the DLR Act prescribes the entitlement of the bhumidhar/owner of the land under the DLR Act to use his land as a bhumidhar. The land which is used by a bhumidhar will include the use of the land for agricultural purposes or related activities of horticulture or animal husbandry or pisciculture or poultry farming. Use of land under Section 22 of the DLR Act also includes the entitlement to make improvements to such land by the bhumidhar. The meaning of improvement has already been discussed above, with reference to Section 3(12) of the DLR Act, for an entitlement to make a building or permanent construction. Therefore, the bhumidhar of the land is entitled to use his land not only for agricultural purposes, but also for making any improvement/construction thereon, and this O. R. No.1/2015 Page 11 of 16 construction has to be of the type as specified in Section 3(12) of the DLR Act. 6. Section 81 of the DLR Act provides that in case the land is not used for agricultural purposes or related purposes of horticulture or animal husbandry or pisciculture or poultry farming, then in such a case under Section 81, the bhumidhar or asami (a tenant under the bhumidhar) is liable to ejectment on a suit filed by Gaon Sabha or a land holder or a Revenue Assistant. Section 81 in a way does seem to suggest that land under the DLR Act can only be used for the purposes of agriculture or horticulture or animal husbandry or pisciculture or poultry farming, however, it is seen that Section 81, though it does not say so, deals with only certain types of lands and not all types of lands under the DLR Act. The subject matter of Section 81 of the DLR Act are only those lands which as per the provisions of the DLR Act have to be used for the purposes of agriculture or horticulture or animal husbandry or pisciculture or poultry farming, i.e. it does not include certain other lands including lands which are used as abadi or for industrial purposes as a lal dora land and provision for which is made under Section 23 of the DLR Act. Therefore, on the one hand, O. R. No.1/2015 Page 12 of 16 Sections 22 and 23 provide for user of the land for non-agricultural purposes including and making construction thereon, but Section 81 on a literal interpretation may seem to suggest that all lands under the DLR Act can only be used for agriculture or horticulture or animal husbandry or pisciculture or poultry farming, though in reality it is not so because if Section 81 is interpreted literally, the same will quite clearly be in conflict with the other provisions of the DLR Act, including Sections 3(12), 22 and 23. It is therefore held that lands which are the subject matter of Section 81 of the DLR Act are only lands which as per DLR Act can only be used for agriculture and related purposes as specified in Section 81. Thus, the issue with respect to any re-entry/possession of land by a suit by Gaon Sabha/land holder or Revenue Assistant as prescribed in Section 81 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act will arise only with respect to lands which are subject matter of Section 81 of the DLR Act i.e. those lands which are used for agriculture and other related purposes as specified in Section 81 of the DLR Act, and no other land. 7. Therefore, now let us examine the issue which is referred to this Court under Section 113 CPC as to whether a boundary wall O. R. No.1/2015 Page 13 of 16 can be constructed/made on those lands which are subject matter of Section 81 of the DLR Act vis-à-vis the lands which are used for agriculture and related purposes as specified in Section 81. 8. The term „boundary‟ or „boundary wall‟ is not defined either under the DLR Act and the Rules framed thereunder or under the Delhi Land Revenue Act and the Rules framed thereunder. There is however a reference to boundaries under the Delhi Land Revenue Act and Delhi Land Revenue Rules, and the relevant provisions have also been also reproduced above. The object of a boundary mark is to demarcate the land of a land owner/bhumidhar/asami etc. from the other lands. The boundary marks are, therefore, permanent marks for demarcating the lands. A reference to the relevant Rules vis-à-vis Rule 381 onwards of the Delhi Land Revenue Rules, or for that matter, any other provisions of the DLR Act or its Rules or Delhi Land Revenue Act, do not show any prohibition against the construction of a boundary wall. However, what is specified is the construction of permanent boundary marks. The provision of construction on boundary marks does not and cannot be said to prohibit construction of a boundary wall. There is nothing in the DLR Act and Rules or O. R. No.1/2015 Page 14 of 16 Delhi Land Revenue Act and Rules which expressly or impliedly prohibit construction of the boundary wall around lands which are subject matter of Section 81 of the DLR Act. The type of boundary marks, are those as specified in Rule 383, and this Rule only specifies the types of the boundary marks, but these relevant Rules alongwith the related Rules 384 to 386, do not in any manner, prohibit the construction of boundary walls with or on the boundary marks. Surely therefore, any land owner or land holder covered under Section 81, is entitled to construct a boundary wall on his own land, and this boundary wall will however be made in such a way that the permanent boundary marks which are made for demarcation will not be effaced or removed but will continue to be clearly shown, though, maybe along-with being a part of the boundary wall around a land of a land holder falling under Section 81. 9. I may note that the reference order of the Deputy Commissioner makes reference to an order dated 18.04.2012 in the case titled as Babita Agarwal and Anr. v. Govt.of NCT of Delhi and Anr. in W.P.(C) No.875/2012, however, it is seen that the order dated 18.04.2012 is just an order and not a judgment giving reasons and O. R. No.1/2015 Page 15 of 16 discussion as to whether or not a boundary wall can or cannot be constructed on agricultural lands or lands for related purposes falling under Section 81 of the DLR Act. Therefore, the order dated 18.04.2012 in W.P.(C) No.875/2012 in no manner can be held to determine the issue as to whether a boundary wall can or cannot be constructed around the lands, which are subject matter of Section 81 of the DLR Act. 10. At this stage, this Court would like to state that though no height of the boundary wall is prescribed or specified as per the DLR Act or its Rules, or Delhi Land Revenue Act or its Rules, since however, inspections have to take place of the agricultural lands and those lands which are subject matter of Section 81 of the DLR Act, twice a year for making khasra girdwari, or otherwise also to ensure that provisions of the DLR Act and Rules or Delhi Land Revenue Act and Rules are complied with, it is ordered that a wall which is constructed for bounding the land of a land holder, under the DLR Act, should not exceed 5 feet in height, and this observation is being made specifically restricted to those lands which are used for the purposes as specified in Section 81 of the DLR Act. O. R. No.1/2015 Page 16 of 16 11. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the Reference is answered by holding that, there is no express or implied bar either under the DLR Act and Rules or under the Delhi Land Revenue Act and Rules, for a land holder of those lands which are subject matter of Section 81 of the DLR Act, to construct a boundary wall around his land, and such boundary wall can be constructed on the land by the land holder, with the clarification that the height of the boundary wall will not exceed 5 feet in height. Reference is accordingly answered and now parties will appear before the Deputy Commissioner/Collector (South West) Delhi on 30th October, 2018. The Original Reference file be sent back to the concerned Deputy Collector after retaining a copy of the file O. Ref. No.1/15 in this Court alongwith copy of today‟s judgment.
