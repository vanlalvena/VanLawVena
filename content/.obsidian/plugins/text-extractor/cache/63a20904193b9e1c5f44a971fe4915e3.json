The third appellant is the local correspondent of the news- paper at Meerut and at the material date had been so employed for the past 7 years. ln July, 1941, the Sessions Judge at Meerut Mr. Hari Shankar Vidyarthi had been engaged in the trial of 20 persons charged with murder, rioting, etc., which ended on 31st July, 1941, when the Judge convicted four of the accused and sentenced them to transportation for life.

With the judicial officers also now co- operating actively in the war efforts, the \"efforts\" are bound to receive a heavy push forward. The judicial officers all over the Province have been, I reliably learn, asked by the New Chief Justice of •the Allahabad High Court, who, it is understood, bas been requested by His Excellency the G~vernor for co-operation in war efforts, to rau.e sub· scriptions for the war funds, The judicial officers raising money make it quite clear to the persons whom they ask to contribute -that the donations were voluntary and they were not exercising any comprlsion in asking for funds. They could donate as much or as little as they pleased, There followed a short report of the judgment in the murder case headed \"Murder Case Juclgment.\" In the issue of the Hindustan Times of 6th August there appeared the following paragraph which appears to be an editorial com• ment: If it is true that the new Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court, Sir Iqbal Ahmad, in bis adminitrative capacity, bas issued a circular to the judicial officers under bis jurisdiction, enjoining on them to raise contri- butions to the war funds, then it must be said that be had done a thing which would lower the prestige of the Courts in the eyes of the people. The presiding officer of a Court, while asking for funds, may say that the contribution is voluntary, but he' cannot re- move the idea. from the mind of a person, particularly a litigant, th_at the request is being made by one whom it may not be safe to displeasa. To be absolutely voluntary, war contributions ought to be raised only by non•official committees or individuals. It was bad enough that the services of the mem- bers of the executive were utilized for the purpose, but to make judicial officers do this work is something far worse. ·, Devi Prasad Sharma ancl another oppo- site parties.\" When the parties ap- peared Mr. Gandhi filed an affidavit in which he said that since the notice was issued he had made personal inquiries at Meerut and had ascertain• ed certain facts which he set out, but desired to assure the Court that it was no part of his intention to cast any reflection upon the conduct of the Chief Justice or to bring the Court into disrepute or contempt, and that he would be sorry indeed if his conduct in publishing the comments, which he did publish as editor relying on the accu· racy of his informant, were interpreted as implying any malicious intention on · bis part or intended to bring the Court ·or any member of it into· disrepute. Their Lordships for reasons which will appear do not find it necessary to enumerate the facts alleged in Mr. Gandhi's affidavit. In substance they were that Mr. Singhal had been pre- sent in the Court of Mr. Vidyarthi on 31 st July when he gave judgment in the murder case, and that after sen• tencing the four accused to transpor• tation for life the Judge made the fol- lowing statement in open Court : On 8th August the Chief Justice Sir {qbal Ahmad and Collister, J. ordered • that notice should be given to the first two appellants to appear in Court on 9th September I 941, to show cause ~hy they should not be punished for contempt of Court for publishing the above comment in the Hindustan Times.

This statement was accepted by counsel, and the case has proceeded on t'-ie footing that no circu· lar and no request was issped by the Chie~ Justice to Judicial Officers of the suboi-dinate Courts to the effect stated. At the end of the hearing on 9th September the Chief Justice address_ing counsel said ''We are going to reserve judgment. Having given due we~ght to what you have said, we have arrived at the conclusion that your clients are guilty of contempt of Court, and in the absence of an apology for which we give time until the day after to-morrow, it shall be our duty to pass sentence according to law.\" There then followed a series of transactions on which the appellahts in support of their case proposed strongly to rely, but which their Lordships find it unnecessary to Sunday, 3rd August on information ·. supplied by him.\" The case proceeded • . on this footing on 26th and 27tb Septem• · her and 27th and 28th October · when Mr. Vidyarthi appeared by coun- sel who cross-examined the wi'~nesses called by the appellants. It should bE! stated that no objection was taken by_ the appellants' counsel to any of tire procedure adopted by the Court. On 14th November the Chief Justice deli- vered the considered judgment of the Court. He reviewed the evidence and came to the conclusion that Mr. Vid- yarthi had not made the statement imputed to him: and that Mr. Singhal had founded his report upon \"nothing more substantial than a suggestion or an easy inference from the facts.'' The Chief Justice then stated that in the opinion of the Court the charge of contempt was established against .all three respondents. He proceeded to state what impression in the opinion ··discuss in view of their opinion upon the question whether the appellants were guilty of any contempt of Court upon which they ought to have been convicted. The Chief Justice before the day reserved for judgment arrived had with Collister, J. interviewed Mr. Vidyarthi and gave notice to the appellants on 11th September that as he had asserted that most of the allegations in Mr. Gandhi's affidavit were untrue, the Court proposed to examine him and another witness in Court on 15th Sep· tember and that the appellants would be given the opportunity of calling further evidence. The two witnesses were exa- mined the case was further adjourned to 25tl; September the Chief Ju~tice stating that in a way Mr. Vidyarthi was also on trial, and would be allow- ed to produce witnesses. At the re• sumed hearing the Chief Justice said that if Mr. Vidyarthi did not utter the words alleged then Mr. Singhal would primarily be guilty ?f . conte_mpt of Court having sent the mtormatton and that it was desirable that the proceed- ings should ccntinue together. Accord- ingly it was agreed by Mr. Singhal and all the parties that Mr. Singhal should accept a notice then issued that he should ''show cause why he should not be dealt with for contempt of this Court with respect to the news pub· lished in the Hindustan Times of of the Court an ordinary intelligent reader would receive from reading the editorial comment of the 6th August. \"The comment contains a clear insinua• tion that the Chief Justice had issued a circular to all judicial officers to raise contributions from litigants and o_thers to the war fund, that pressure was thereby being exerted by an autho- rity which • it would not be safe to displease' and that the prestige of the Courts would thus be im- paired. The implication is that the Chief Justice had done something which was unworthy of a person holding that high office and that as the head and representative of this High Court he had committed the gross impropriety of forcing judicial officers subordinate to this Court to ask for war contribu- tions from litigants, who, notwith-. standing that the giving of . donations was ostensibly voluntary, were not in a position to refuse.' ' As to Mr. Singhdl , the Court found that he sent informa• tion which was probably founded either on his own inference from what took place or on a suggestion from other persons, and he had endeavoured to· defend his action by giving evidence which they were unable to accept as true.

The printer was fined Rs. 500 or in default a month's imprisonment, Mr. Gandhi was fined Rs. 1,000 or in default a month's imprisonment. The Court eventually refused a stay pend- ing appeal, and Mr. Singhal and Mr. Gandhi have both served their terms of imprisonment. At the hearing of the appeal their Lordships intimated that they desired to deal first with the primary question whether in the circumstances the wo.:·ds complained of were capable of being a contempt of Court, and counsel for both sides argued this point. On the conclusion of this argument their Lordships inti· mated that their decision was in favour of the appellants. The other points therefore raised by the appellants were not further discuss~d by counsel for the appellants or at ,all by counsel for the respondent, and their Lordships must not be taken as expressing any opinion one way or the other upon them. In their Lordships' opinion the conviction for contempt of Court cannot stand. The cases of contempt which consists of ''scandalising the Court itself\" are fortunately rare and require to be treated with much discretion. .In 1899 this Board pronounced proceedings for this species of contempt to be obsolete in this country, though surviving in other parts of the Empire: but they added it is'a weapon to be used sparingly and always with reference to the admi- nistration of justice, McLeod v. St. Aubyn ( 1). ln the reference from the Bahama Islands (2) the test applied by the very strong Board which heard the reference was whether the words complained of were in the circumstances calculated to obstruct or interfere with the_ course of justice and the due administration of the law. In Reg. v. Gray (3) it was shown that the offence of scandalising the Court itself was not obsolete, in this country. A very scandalous attack had been made upon a Judge for his judicial utterances while sitting in a (1) (1819) A.O. 5'11. (2) (1890) 2 Q.B. 36. (3) (1893) A.C. 138. Vol.~S6-102 criminal case on circuit ; and it was with the foregoing opinions on record that Lord Russell of Killowen, L.CJ. adopting the expression of Wilmot, C. J. in his opinion in Rex v. Almon ( 4), which is the source of much of the present law on the subject, spoke of the article complained of as '•calculated to lower the authority of the Judge.'' When the comment in question in the present case is examined it is found that there is no criticism of any judicial act of the Chief Justice, or any imputa• tion on him for anything done-or omit- ted to be done by him in the adminis- tration of justice. It can hardly be said that there is any criticism of him in his administrative capacity. for as far as their Lordships have been informed the administrative control of the sub- ordinate Courts of the Province, what• ever it · is, is exercised not by the Chief Justice, but by the Court over which he presides. The appellants are not charged with saying anything in con- tempt of the subordinate Courts or the administration of justice by them. In truth the Chief Justice is alleged un- truly as is now admitted to have com- mitted an ill-advised act in writing to his Subordinate Judges asking (as the · news item says), enjoining (as the corn• ment says) them to collect for the War Fund. If the facts were as alleged they admitted of criticism. No doubt it is galling for any judicial personage to be criticised publicly as having done something outside his judicial proceedings which was ill-advised or indiscreet. But judicial personages can afford not to be too ,sensitive. A simple denial in public of -the alleged request would at once have allayed the trouble. If a Judge is defamed in such a way as not to affect the administra- tion of justice he has the ordinary remedies for defamation if he should feel impelled to use them. Their Lord- ships cannot accept the view taken by the Court as stated above of the mean- ing of the comment : the words do not support the innuendo. In the opinion of their Lordships the proceedings in contempt were misconceived, and the appellants were not guilty _ of the con- tempt alleged. · At the . end of the hearing their Lordships intimated they (4) Wilm. 2'3, 117 EDg, Bep.

Page for Respt. JUDGMENT. Lord Porter.-This is an appeal against a conviction for abetment of forgery under S. 466 combined.. with S. 109 of the Indian Penal Code. The eppellant was charged with abett;ng one Jagannath Singh and one Matuk Chandra Das in forging a certain decree sheet and compromise petition, which are Court records and was found guilty by the Sessions Judge of the Santai Parganas. This conviction was upheld by the High Court at Patna. The history of the case has been fully and accurately stated in the judg-. ment of Chatterji, J. in the hligh Court\" and need not be repeated at length here. It is only necessary to set out sufficient facts to make this judgment comprehensible. · In 1934, the appellant, one Buchai, and his son Khudi wel'e parties to -a suit for the partition of their joint family property, a suit which was even• tually compromised. In order to effect their purpose the parties on 13th December 1935, fibd a compromise petition in accordance with which a decree of the Court was drawn up and signed on the 23rd of the same month. It is common ground that a certain plot of land situate in Jasidih Bazar and numbered 67 was not part of the joint family property b,ut was purchased by Khudi during the pendency of the suit, and that a registered sale deed assign• ing the property to him was drawn up dated 22nd January 1935. This plot therefore was not included in the com. promise petition or the decree : it was and remained in the possession of Khudi in the sense that he received rent from its tenants. By an interpolation in each document this piece of property has now been added to the share assigned to Thakur in both the petition and decree. The prosecution's case was and is that the appellant procured this insertion in these two places and abetted the forgery. By the charge they asserted and in evidence they sought to prove that the forgery was carried out as to the decree sheet by J agannath abetted by Matuk and as to the petition by· Matuk abetted by Jagannath. The appellant was accused of abetting both these persons in the offence of forging · the two documents. Direct evidence of the commission of the substantive. offence by Jagannath and Matuk was given by one Chandrama Singh whose story was to some extent corroborated and was accepted by the Sessions Judge in spite of the view that the witness must be regarded as an accom- plice, The High Court. also thought him to be in the position of an accomplice but contrary to the view of the trial Judge thought him to be in- sufficiently corroborated to justify a conviction for forgery againat either","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
