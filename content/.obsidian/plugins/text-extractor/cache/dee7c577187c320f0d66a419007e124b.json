His grievance is that he having failed to produce the same when called upon to do so in the cross-examination, an adverse inference be drawn against him that he did not have a valid licence to drive a pick-up van. The submission fails to carry conviction with us. The burden to prove that there was breach of the contract of insurance wa1-, squarely placed on the shoulders of the insurance company. It could not be said to have been discharged by it by a mere question in cross-examination. The s~cond appellant was under no obligation to furnish evidence so as to enable the insurance company to wriggle out its liability under the contract of insurance. Further the R.T.A. which issues the driving licence keeps a record of the licences issued and renewed by it. The insurance company could have got the evidence produced to substantiate its a]]egation. Apply- ing the test who would fail jf no evidence is led, the obvious answer is the insurance company. 15. To sum up the insurance company failed to prove that there was a breach of the term of the contract of insurance as evidenced by the policy of insurance on the ground that the driver who was driving the vehicle at the relevant time did not have a valid driving licence. Once the insurance company failed to prove that aspect, its liability under the contract of insurance remains intact and unhampered and it was bound to satisfy the award under the com- prehensive policy of insurance. 16. Accordingly, both these appeals must succeed and are partly allowed. The award of the Tribunal as welt as the iudgment of the High Court are modified directing the Oriental Fire ard General Insurance Co. Ltd. to satisfy the award with interest at 12 per cent from the date of the accident till payment, and full costs in favour of the original claimants. The full payment to satisfy the award shall he made within a period of two months from today. (1985) 2 Supreme Court Ca9es 580 (BEFORE Y.V. CHANORAC'HUD. CJ. AND D.A. DESAI, 0. CHINNAPPA REDDY. E.S.

Allowing the appeal and the writ petition Supreme Court Held: A pen,on who is sentenced to life imprisonment is sentenced to imprison~ ment for a 'term'. The word 'term' does not necessarily imply a concept of d!>certainabihty or conveys a sense of certainty. Sections 53, 53•A(4)(a) and (b), 57 or 65 IPC do not militate against this conclusion, nor the words \"for a term which may extend to one half of the impriso\"nment for life\" in Section 511 IPC !>Upport this conclusion . The expressions 'imprisonment for life' and 'imprisonment for a term' are not used either in the Penal Code or in the Criminal Procedure Code in contradistinction with each other. Two or moce expressions are often used in the same section in order to exhaust the alternatives which are available to the Legislature. That does not mean that there is, necessarily, an antithe!,IS between those expressions. (Paras 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 14) Usually, those whc., are liable to be sentenced to imprisonment for life are not enlarged on bail. The benefit of Section 428 must be available to them otherwise it would amount to withdrawal of application of a benevolent provision from a large majority of cases in which such benefit would be needed and justified on equitable considerations.

Graver the crime, longer the sentence and, longer the sentence, greater the need for set-otis and remissions. Punishments are no longer retributory. They are reformative. (Para 15) The modaJ1ties for working out the provisions of Section 428 would be that by virtue uf Section 433-A, where a sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed on a person for an offence for which death is one of the punishments provided by law, or where a sentence of death imposed on a person has been commuted under Section 433 to one of imprisonment for life, such person cannot be released from prison unless he has served at least fourteen years of imprisonment. But Section 433-A being prospective in operation, it cannot apply to cases which were decided by the trial court before December 18, 1978, being the date on which the section came into force. The question of settmg off the period of detention undergone by an accused as an undertrial prisoner against the sentence of life imprisonment can arise only if an order is passed by the appropriate authority under Section 432 or Section 43J. Jn the absence of such order, passed generally or specially, and apart from the provisions, if any, of the relevant Jail ManuaJ, imprisonment for life would mean, according to the rule in Gopal Vinayak Godse, imprisonment for the remainder of life.

DELHI AIJM[NISTRATION (Chandrachud, C.J.) 583 Court asking that his case be referred for the orders of the Delhi Administration under paragraph 516-B of the Punjab Jail Manual since, though sentenced to life imprisonment, he had undergone a period of detention in jail amounting to 14 years together with the remissions earned by him. A learned Single Judge of the High Court rejected that petition on the ground that, in computing the period of 14 years, the period spent by the convict in the jail as an undertrial prisoner cannot be taken into account because, Section 428 of the Code which allows such a set off applies only when an accused has been sentenced to 'imprisonment for a term', and the sentence of life imprisonment is not an imprisonment 'for a term'. In coming to the conclusion that Section 428 has no application to cases in which an accused is sentenced to life imprisonment, the learned Judge relied upon a judgment of this Court in Kartar Singh v. State of Haryana1 • 3. The petitioner in the companion writ petition, Rakesh Kaushik, has a somewhat similar grievance, though he has needlessly introduced extraneous matters in his pleadings. One of his contentions is that the remissions earned by him as a convict must be taken into account while computing the period of 14 years under paragraph 516-B of the Punjab Jail Manual. He contends also, that in any case, he ought to be given the benefit of Sections 432 and 433 of the Code because, his case merits a favourable consideration by the Delhi Administration. In support of his case, he relies upon an order dated March 3, 1983 passed by this Court in Sukhlal Hansda v. State of W.B. 2 According to the counter-affidavit filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home) of the Delhi Administration, the petitioner's case cannot be considered for premature release because he has not yet undergone 14 years of imprisonment, inciusive of remissions earned by him. 4. First, we would prefer to interpret Section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on its own terms, that is, divorced from con- siderations arising under the Punjab Jail Manual or any other Jail Manual. The provisions of Jail Manuals vary from State to State. Therefore, questions arising under those Manuals cannot be mixed up with questions arising under the Code, which is the law of the land. Section 428 of the Code reads thus : Period of detention undergone by the accused to be set oU agciinst the sentence of imprisonment .-Where an accused person has, on conviction, been sentenced to imprisonment for a term, not being imprisonment in default of payment of fine, the period of detention, if any, undergone by him during the investigation, 1.

The neat and, we believe, the simple question for decision is whether imprisonment for life is imprisonment \"for a term\". The reason why it is urged that imprisonment for life is not imprisonment for a term is that the latter expression comprehends only imprison- ments for a fixed, certain and ascertainable period of time like six months, two years, five years and so on. Since the sentence of life imprisonment, as held by this Court in Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra·', 1s a sentence for life and nothing less and since, the term of life is itself uncertain, the sentence of life imprisonment is for an uncertain term, that 1s to ~ay, that 1t i~ not imprisonment for a term. 6. So goel) the argument. So doe~ it go but it fails to carry much conviction. Life il) uncertain. ln more ways than one. Who knows what good may come tomorrow and how many good tomorrows there are still to go? But, philosophical digressions apart, especially optimistic, the fact that the term of life is of an uncertain duration doe~ not justify the conclusion that the sentence of imprisonment for life is not tor a term. The relevant question and, the only one, to ask under Section 428 is ; Ha~ this person been sentenced to imprisonment tor a term? For the ~ake of convenience, the question may be split into two parts. One, has this per~on been sentenced to imprisonment ? And, two, i~ the imprisonment 'to which he has been sentenced an imprisonment for a term ? There can possibly be no dispute that a person sentenced to life imprisonment is sentenced to 1mprisonment. Then, what 1~ the term to which he is sentenced ? The obvious answer to that question is · that the term to which he has been sentenced is the term of his life. Therefore, a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment i~ ~entenced to imprisonment for a term. 7. We see but little warrant for qualifying the word 'term' by the adjective 'fixed' which is not to be found in Section 428. The assumption that the word 'term' implies a concept of ascertainability or convey~ a sense of certainty is contrary to the letter of the law, as we find it in that section. Even the marginal note to the section does not bear out that assumption. It rather belies it. And, marginal notes are now legislative and not editorial exercises. The marginal 3.

Ltd. ~(CCC® ION LINE\" True Prinf BHAOIRATH v. DELHI ADMINISIRATION (Clzandrachud, C.J.) 585 note of Section 428 shows that the object of the Legislature in enact- ing the particular provision was to provide that 'the period of detention undergone by the accused' should 'be set off against the sentence' of imprisonment' imposed upon him. There are no words of limitation either in the section or in its marginal note which would justify restrict- ing the plain and natural meaning of the word 'term' so as to com- prehend only sentences which are imposed for a fixed or ascertainable period. 8. To say that a ~entence of life imprisonment imposed upon an accused is a st\"ntence for the term of his life does offence neither lo grammar nor to the common understanding of the word 'term'. To say otherwise would offend not only against the language of the statute but against the spirit of the law, that is to say the object with which the law was passed. A large number of cases in which the accused suffer long undertrial detentions are cases punishable with impri!>onment for life. Usually, those who are liable to be sentenced to imprisonment for life are not enlarged on bail. To deny the benefit of Section 428 to them is to withdraw the application of a benevolent provision from a large majority of cases in which such benefit would be needed and justified. 9. Arguments and counter-arguments were advanced before us on the basis of provisions contained in Sections 53, 53-A( 4) (a) and ( b), 5 7, 65 and 511 of the Penal Code. The provision contained m Section 5 7 that imprisonment for life has to be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years is for the purpose of calculating fractions of terms of punishment. We cannot press that provision into ~ervice for a wider purpose. Nor, indeed, can we draw sustenance to our conclusion from the provision contained in Section 511 to the effect that whoever attempts to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment for life shall be punished with imprisonment \"for a term which may extend to one-half of the imprisonment for life\". The argument of Shri Mukul Mudgal that if one-half of life imprisonment i~ ··a term'' ex hypothesi, life imprisonment would be \"a term of imprisonment'' is attractive but slender. But, equally, we do not consider that anything contained in the rest of the sections above noted, militates against the view which we have taken. 10. The modalities for working out the provision contained in Section 428 in ca~es of persons sentenced to imprisonment for life should not present any serious difficulty in practice. In the first place, by reason of Section 433-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, where a sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed on a person for an offence for which death is one of the punishments provided by law, or where a sentence of death imposed on a person has been corn- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The only point to note is that while uphold- ing the constitutional validity of Section 433-A, it was held by this Court in Maru Ram v. Union of India\\ that the section is prospective in operation, with the result that it cannot apply to cases which were decided by the trial court before December 18, 1978, being the date on which the section came into force. 11. The second aspect of the matter which has to be borne in mind is the one arising out of the judgment of this Court in Gopal Vinayak Godse:i. It was held by a Constitution Bench in that case that a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment is bound to serve the remainder of his life in prison unless the sentence imposed upon him is commuted or remitted by the appropriate authority. It was further held that since such a sentence could not be equated with any fixed term, the Rules framed under the Prison Act entitled such a person to earn remissions but that, such remissions were to be taken into account only towards the end of the term. Under Section 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the appropriate Government has the power to remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which a person has been sentenced. Under Section 433 of the Code, the appropriate Government has the power, inter alia, to commute the sentence of imprisonment for life to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years or to fine. The question of setting off the period of detention undergone by an accused as an undertrial prisoner against the sentence of life imprisonment can ·arise only if an order is passed by the appropriate authority under Section 43 2 or Section 43 3 of the Code. In the absence of such order, passed generally or specially, and apart from the provisions, if any, of the relevant Jail Manual, imprisonment for life would mean, according to the rule in Gopal Vinayak Godse3 , imprisonment for the remainder of life. 12. The two cases before us were referred to a larger Bench because of the ddubt entertained as regards the correctness of the decision in Kartar Singh 1 , especially because of the apparently conflict- ing view taken by another Bench of this Court in Sukhlal HallSda v. State of W.B. 2 Both of those decisions were rendered by a three- Judge Bench. In Kartar Singh1, persons who were sentenced to life imprisonment challenged an order passed by the Government of Haryana, denying to them the benefit of the period of undertrial detention under Section 428 of the Code. It was held by this Court that the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code make a clear 4.

DELHI ADMINISTRATION (Chandrachud, C.J.) 587 distinction between 'imprisonment for life' and 'imprisonment for a term' and, in fact, the two expressions are used in contradistinction with each other in one and the same section, the former meaning imprisonment for the remainder of the natural life of the convict and the latter meaning imprisonment for a definite or fixed period. The Court proceeded to hold that an order of remission pas:>ed by the appropriate authority merely affects the execution of the sentence passed by the Coun, without interfering with the sentence passed or recorded by the Court. Therefore, Section 428 which opens with the words \"where an accused person has, on conviction, been sentenced to imprisonment for a term\", would come into play only in cases where 'imprisonment for a term' is awarded on• conviction by a cowt and not where the sentence imposed upon an accused becomes a sentence for a term by reason of the remission granted by the appropriate authority. Finally, according to the Court, \"the question is not whether the beneficent provision should be extended to life convicts on an a priori reasoning or equitable consideration but whether on true construction, the section comprises life convicts within its purview\". The Court found support to its view in the Objects and Reasons for introducing Section 428 in the Code, as set out in the Report of the Joint Committee. 13. We have considered with great care the reasoning upon which the decision in Kartar Singh' proceeds. With respect, we are unable to agree with the decision. We have already discussed why, imprison- ment for life is imprisonment for a term, within the meaning of Section 428. We would like to add that we find it difficult to agree that the expressions 'imprisonment for life' and 'imprisonment for a term' are used either in the Penal Code or in the Criminal Procedure Code in contradistinction with each other .. Sections 304, 305, 307 and 394 of the Penal Code undoubtedly provide that persons guilty of the respective offences, shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding a certain number of years. But, that is the only manner in which the Legi~lature could have expressed its intention that persons who are guilty of those offences shall be punished with either of the sentences mentioned in the respective sections. The circumstances on which the learned Judges have placed reliance in Kartar Singh 1 , do not afford any evidence, intrinsic or otherwise, of the use of the two expressions in contra- distinction with each other. Two or more expressions are often used in the same section in order to exhaust the alternatives which are available to the Legislature. That doei, not mean that there is, necessarily, an antithesis between those expressions. 14.

It is not because of remission that a sentence of life imprison- ment becomes an imprisonment for a term. 15. We have also already answered the last of the reasons given in Kartar Singh1 that the question is not whether the beneficent pro- vision contained in Section 428 should be extended to life convicts on equitable considerations. We enter a most respectful caveat. Equity sustains law and the twain must meet. They cannot run in parallel streams. Equitable considerations must have an important place in the construction of beneficent provisions, particularly in the field of criminal law. To exclude such considerations is to denude law's benevolence of its true and lasting content. Lastly, the view expressed by the Joint Committee in its Report does not yield to the inference that the \"mischief sought to be remedied has no relevance where gravity of offence requires the imposition of imprisonment for life\". As we have indicated earlier, graver the crime, longer the sentence and, longer the sentence, greater the need for set-offs and remissions. Punishments are no longer retributory. They are reformative. 16. The order passed by this Court in Sukhlal Hansda::. related to the cases of 24 prisoners who were sentenced to life imprisonment. Most of those prisoners had undergone imprisonment for a period which, after taking into account the remission..1o earned by them, exceeded fourteen years. It was held by this Court that, for the purpose of considering whether the cases of those prisoners should be examined for premature release under the relevant provisions of the West Bengal Jail Manual, there was no reason why the period of imprisonment undergone by them as undertrial prisoners should not be taken into account. The Court directed that the cases of the prisoners should be considered by the State Government, both for the purpose of setting off the period of detention undergone by them as undertrial prisoners and for taking into account the remissions earned by them. The order passed by the Court does not discuss the point which arises before us though, the observations made therein are consistent more with the view which we have taken than with the view taken in Kartar Singh'. 17. For these reasons, we allow the appeal and the writ petition and direct that, the period of detention undergone by the two accused before us as undertrial prisoners, shall be set off against the sentence of life imprjsonment imposed upon them, subject to the provision contained in Section 433-A and, provided that orders have been passed ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.
