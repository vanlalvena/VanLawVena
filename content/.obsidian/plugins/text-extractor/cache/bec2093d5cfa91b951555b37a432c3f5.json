XV of 1948), s.4(1)(b). The petitioner was a partnt:r in a firm that carried on the business of manufacture and sale of hand~made biilis. On December 14, 1957, the State Government issued a notification under s. 4(l)(b) of the U. P. Sales Tax Act, 1948. Section 4(1)(b) of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948, providos as follows:- \"No tax shall be payable on- ( a) The sale of water, milk, salt, newspapers and motor spirit as defined ii) the U. P. State Motor Spirit (Taxation) Act, 1939, and of any other goods which the State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette, exempt. (b) The sale of any goods by the All India Spinners' Association of Gandhi Ao;hram, Mcerut, and their branch(\"s or such other persons or class of persons as the State Government may from time to time exempt on such conditions and on payment of such fees, if any, not exceeding eight thousand rupees annually as may be specified by notification in the Official Gazette.\" The notification dated December 14, 1957, issued under s. 4(1jtb) was as follows:- \"In partial modification of notifications No. ST 905/X, dated March 31, 1956 and ST 418/X 902(9) 52, dated January 31, 1957, and in exercise of the powers confer1ed by clause (b) of sub-section !I) of section 4 of the U.P.

Cigars, cigarettes, biris and tobacco, that is to say any form of tobacco, whether cured or uncured and whether manufactured or not and includes the leaf, stalks and stems of tobacco plant but does not include any part of a tobacco plant while still attached to the earth.\" By a subsequent notification is•.med on November 25, 1958, hand-made and machine-made bidia were unconditio· nally exempted from payment of sales tax from July 1, 1958. The Sales Tax Officer sent a notice to the firm for the as~essment. of tax on sale of bidis during the assessment period April l, 1958, to June 30, 1958. The firm claimed that the notification dated December 1.4, 1957, had exempted bidia from payment of sales tax and that, therefore, it was not liable to pay sales tax on,xhe sale of bidia. This position was not accepted by the Sales Tax Officer who passed the following order on December 20, 1958,- \"The exemption envi~aged in this n'>tification,applies ·to dealers in respect of sales of biris provided that the additional Central Excise duties leviable thereon from the closing of business on 13. 12. 1957 have been paid on such go0ds. The assessees paid :no such excise duties. Sales af biris by the assessees are therefore liable to sales tax\". The firm appealed under s. 9 of the Act to the Jqdge (Appeals) Sales Tax, but that was dismissed on May 1, 1959. The firm had however moved the High Court under Art. 226 ~f tlie Constitution before that date. The High Court took the view. that the firm had another remed}'\\ under the Act and that the Sales Tax Officer had not committed any appareht firror in interpreting~ notification of December 14, 1957. An appeal against the order of the High Oourt on a certificate under Art. 133 (l)(a) was dismissed bv this Court for non· pros~cution anp the firm filed an application for restoration of the appeal: and condonation .of dday. During the pendency of that,~ppe!ll the present 'PeLitivn was filed by th~ ,petitioner under Art. 32 of the constitution for the enforcement of her fundamental ri~ht under Arts. 19(1)(g) and 31 of the con'Stlhltions.

State of U.P. A I.R. 1957 S.C. 790 relied upon by the petitioner was challenged. That Bench referred the following questions for derision by a larger Bench,- \" I. Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires open to challenge as repugnant to Art. 19 (I) (g), on the sole ground that it is based on a misconstruction of a provision of the Act or of a notification issued thereunder ?\" 2. Can the validity of such an order be questioned in a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution ? 11 Held (per Das, Kapur, Sarkar, Hidayatullah and Mudholka~, JJ.) that in the case under consideration the answer to tht que!tions must be in the negative. The case of Kai/,ash Nath was not correctly decided and the deci•ion is not sustainable on the authorities on which it was baaed. Kai/JJshNath v. State of U. P., A. I. R. 1957 S. C. 790, disapproved. Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bih,ar, (1955) 2 S. C. R. 603 and Bidi Supply Co. v. Union of India, (1956) s. C. R. 267, explained. Per S. K. Das, J.-The right to move this Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of fundamental right~ conferred by Pait IIJ of the Constitution is itself a guaranteed fundamental right and this Court is not trammel- led by procedural technicalities in making an order or issuing a writ for the enforcement of such rights. There is no disagreement that in the following three classes of cases a question of the enforcement of a fundamental right may arise and if it docs arise, an application under Art. 32 will lie, namely, (IJ where action is taken under a statute which is ultra vires the Constitution; (2) where the statute is intra vir~s but the action taken is without jurisdic- tion; and ( 3 J where the action taken is procedurally ultra vire• as where a quasi-judicial authority under an obligation to act judicially passes an order in violation of the principles of natural justice. Where, however, a quasi-judicial authority makes an order in the undoubted exercise of its jurisdiction in pursuance l s.c.R. SUPREME OOURT REPORTS 781 of a provision of law which is intra vires, .an error of law or fact committed by that authority cannot be impeached other- wise than on appeal, unless the erroneous determination relates to a matter on which the jurisdiction of that body depends. A tribunal may lack jurisdiction if it is improperly constituted, or if it fails to observe certain essential preliminaries to the inquiry; but it does not exceed its jurisdiction by basing its dedsion upon an incorrect determination of any question that it is empowered or required (i. e. has jurisdiction) to deter- mine. In such a case, the characteristic attribute of a judicial act or decision is that it binds, whether right or wrong, and no question of the enforcement of a fundamental right can arise on an application under Art. 32. Therefore, an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires and in the undoubt- ed exercise of its jurisdiction cannot be challenged on the sole ground that it is passed on a misconstruction of a provision of the Act or of a notification issued thereunder. The validity of such an order cannot be questioned on an application under Art. 32. The proper remedy for correcting such an error is to proceed by way of appeal or if the error is an error apparent on the face of the record, then by an application under Art. 226 of the Constitution.

Case law reviewed. Per Kapur, J.-Since the statute was constitutionalJy valid every part of it must be 10 and the determination by the Sales Tax Officer, acting within his jurisdiction under the Act, even though erroneous, was valid and legal. An order of assessment under a statute that was ultra tJ&ru could not be equated with one passed under another that wu intra tliru, even though erroneous. Unlike the former the latter was a constitutioJaal and legal Act and could not violate a fundamental right and or· be impugned under Art. 3~ of the Constitution. If the Salea Tax Officer, acting quasi-judicially, miscon$ .. trued the notification, which it had jurisdiction to c~nstruc) and imposed a tax, there could be no infringement qf Art. 19 ( 1) (g) of the ConatitutiQn 11161 Smt. fljjam Bai v. State of Ultar Pradesh 782 SUPREME COURT REPORTS Ll963] 1911 Case law discussed. Sr.rt. Ujj•m B1i •• Sl1u •I Uttlf' P\"\"4sh Per Subha Rao, J.-The Conslitulion is the paramount Jaw. As the Constitution declares the fundamental rights and also pres-:ribcs the restrictions that may be imposed thereon, no institution can overstep the limits directly or indirectly by encroaching upon the said rights. This Court has no more important function to perform than to preserve the funda men- tal rights of the people, and has l:'-cen given all the instituti<r nal conditions necessary to exercise its jurisdiction without fear or favour. It is settled law that Art. 32 confers a wide jurisdiction on this Court to enforce the fundamental rights that the right to enforce a fundamental right is itself~ fundamental right, and that it j1 the duty of this Court to entertain an application and to d~cidc it on merits whenever a party approaches it, irrespective of whether the question raised involves a question of Jurisdiction, Law or fart. Though the Legislature can make a law imposing rcasonaplc restrictions on a fundamental right in the interest of the public, the Constitution docs not empower the Legislature tp make an order of an executive authority final so '!S to deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction under Art. 32 of the Constitution. The principles and procedure evolved by the courts in England in regard to the issue of prerogative writs cann.ot circumscribe tbe wide power of the Supreme Court to issue orders and directions for the enforcement of fuml11mcnta I rights. The issuance of such writs can be regulated by evolv- ing appropriate procedure to meet different situations. What• ever may be the stage at which this Court is approached this Court roay in i1s discretion, if the question involved is one of jurisdiction or a construction of a provision, decide the qucs .. tion and enforce the right without waiting till the procedure pres<ribcd by a law is exhausted; but if it finds that questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and Jaw arc involved, it may give an opportunity to the party, if he agrees, to renew the application after he has exhausted his remedies under the Act, or, if he docs not agree, to adjourn the petition till after the remedies arc exhausted. If the fundamental right of the petitioner depends upon the findings of fact arrivca at by the administrative tribunals in exercise of the p0wcrs conferred on them under the Act, this Court may in its discretion ordinarily accept the findings and dispose of the application on the basis of those findings. The principle of rea jvdicata accepted by this llOW't in Daryao v. Stal• of U. P. cannot be involved in the case 0£ orders of administrative tribunals. That apart, when a 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 783 petitioner seeks to quash the order of a tribunal, no question of ru judicata arises, as that doctrine implies that there should be two proceedings and that in the former proceeding an issue has been decided inter-pa.rtes and therefore the same cannot be rcagitated in a subsequent proceeding. Daryao v. State of U. P. (1962) 1 S. C.R. 564. consi- dered. Whether relief can be given under Art. 32 against the order of a court or not, it is c\\ear that administrative tribunals arc only the limba of the Executive, though they exercise quasi-judicial functions, and therefore arc clearly comprchen· ded by the expression \"other authorities\" in Art. 12 of the Constitution and in appropriate cases writs can be issued against them. On a plain reading of the impugned notification it is clear that hand-made bidis arc exempted from sales tax under the Act and therefore the Sales-tax Authorities have no power to impose sales tax thereon. The decision of this Court in the case of Kailaah Nath v. State of U. P., was not incorrect or based on irrelevant decisions. KailashNath v. State of U. P., A. I. R. 1957 S. C. 790, followed.

Per Hidayatullah, J .-Article 32 contains a gwµ-a,ntcc:d right to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundain• ental rights and any person whose fundamental rights bav~ been invaded has a guaranteed right to ~k relict from the Court without having to seek to enforce his remedies elsewhere first. :-.nt the right which he can claim ·is no~ a general right of .~ppeal tgain.'lt dcci!!ion, of courts ao.d tribqna1$, The Sup- reme Court in examining such petitions·would examine them 1961 Smt. Ujjam B•I •• s 1a.t1 •f Ult• Prntl,sh 198' s,,.t. UJjam Bai v. Slat1 of U\" 1r Pr•tl1sh 784 SUPREME OOURT REPORTS (1963] from the narrow stand point of a breach of fundamental rights. If a petitioner fails to establish that, he will fail outright. Taxing laws may sufl'cr froru mauy defects : they may be opposed to the fundamental rights, they may be made by a legislature beyond its own competence, or without observing the formalities laid down by the Constitution. If a taxing law is opposed to fundamental rights it can be challenged under Art. 32. It is not necessary to resort only to Art.265 because Art. 32 stands in no need of support from Art.265. The taxing authorities are instrumr.ntalitics of Govern .. ment. They are a part of the executive even though in assessing and levying the tax they act as quasi-judicial bodies. Their actions in demanding the tax in the ultimate analysis are executive actions. If that action is not backed by law or is beyond their jurisdiction an aggrieved person can have recours• to Art. 32 of the Constitution. Where, however, no question of vire• of the law or jurisdiction is involved the Supreme Court would ordinarily not interfere in a petition under Art. 32 even though the interpretation he erroneous as the matter can be set right by recourse to such appeals or revisions as the law permits. This is based upon the well accepted rule that a court having jurisdiction may decide wrongly as well as rightly. If there i• an error not involving jurisdiction that error can be corrected by the ordinary means of appeals and revisions including an appeal by special leave to the Supreme Court. But if the law is unconstitutional or the interpretation is about jurisdiction which is erroneous a writ under Art. 32 can be claimed. The Supreme Court will keep its two roles separate, namely, (a) as the Supreme Appellate Tribunal against the decisions of all r.ourts and tribunals and (b) as Court of guaranteed J\"Cllort for enforce- ment of fundamental rights. It will not act as the latter when the case is only for exercise of its power as the former. It will, however, interfere if a clear case of breach of fund- amental rights is made out even though there may be other remedies open including an approach to the Supreme Court in its appellate jurisdiction. Ptr Ayyangar, J.-From the fact that a statute was competently enacted and did not violate fundamental rights, it did not necessarily follow that quasi-judicial authorities created by it could not violate fundamental rights. Legislat- ive competence covered only such action as could on a proper interpretation of the statute be taken under it. If a law did not create a liability an authority acting under it could Rot do so by a 111iainterpret1ltion of it, for Legialative backing for 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 785 the imposition of such a liability would be plainly lacking. The answer· to the question should, therefore, be that an action of a quasi-judicial authority would violate a fundament- al right where by a plain and patent misconstruction of the statue such an authority affected fundamental rights. This would constitute another category besides the three others in respect of which violation of such rights was not in doubt, namely, where the statute itself was invalid or unconstitut- ional, where the authority exceeded its jurisdiction under the Act and where it contravened mandatory procedure prescribed by the statute or vielated the principles of natural justice. The exerciae of the judicial power of the State might alsq equally with the Legislative and Executive part involve the violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. Since in the instant case the construction put upon the notification by the Sales Tax Officer was reasonable possible, it was a c;ase of mere error of law and not a pat~nt error or an error apparent on the face of the record which could justify the issue of a writ of certiora1i. Per Mudholkar, J.-The question of enforcement of a fundamental right could arise if a tax wa! a§sessed under a law whiCh was (I) void under Art. 13 or, (2) was ultra virea the Constitution or, (3} where it was suborainate legislation, it was ultra virea the law under which it was made or incon- sistent with any other law in force. A Similar question would arise if the tax was assessed by an authority (I) other than the one empowered to do so under the taxing law Qr (2) in violation of the procedure prescribed by law or, (3) in colourable exercise of the powers conferred by the law. \\Yhere a tax ~ a&Sessed bona· fide by a competent authority under a vahd law ind under the procedu1e laid down by it, no question of infringement of any fundamental right could arise, even though it was based upon an erroneous construction of law unless the tax imposed was beyond the competence of the Legislature 01· violated any of the funda- mental rights or any other provisions of the Constitution. A mere misconstruction of a provision of ?aw did not render the decision of a quasi-judicial tribunal void as being beyond jurisdiction. It stood till it was corrected in the appropriate manner and if such a decision a person was held liable to pay tax he could not treat it as a nullity and contend that it was not authorised by law: The position would be 1968 Smt.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 787 1961. April 28. The above petition coming up for hearing in the first instance before the Constitution Bench consisting of S. K. Das, J. L. Kapur, M. Hidayatallah, J.C. Shah and T. L. Venkataram Ayyar, JJ., the matter was referred to the Chief Justice under O. V-A, r. 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1 U50, as a.mended, by a Judgment delivered by VENKAT.A.RAMA AIYAR, J.-The petitioner is a partner in a. firm oa.lled Messrs. Mohan Lal Hargovind Das, which carries on business in the manufacture a.nd sale of biris in number of States, and is dealer registered under the U .P. Sales Tax Act 15 of 1948 with its head office at A1Iahabad. In the present petition filed under Art. 32 of the Constitution, the petitioner impugns the validity of a levy of sales tax made by the Sales Tax Officer, Allahabad, by his order dated December 20, 1~58. On December 14, 1957, the Government of Uttar Pradesh issued a notification under s. 4(1) (b) of the Act exempting from tax, sales of certain goods including biris, provided that the additional Central Excise duties leviable thereon had been paid. Jn partial modification of this notification, the Government issued another notification on No- vember 25, 1958, exempting from tax uncondition- ally sales of biris, both machinemade and hand- m ·tde, with effect from July 1, 1958, The effect of the two notifications aforesaid taken together is that while for the period, Deoember 14, 1957, to June 30, 1958, the exemption of biris from tax was s1~bject to the proviso contained in the notification dated December 14, 1957, for the period commenc- ing from July 1, 1958, it was unconditional and absolute. The petitiom~r's firm filed its return for the quarter ending June, 1958, disclosing a gross turn- 1962 Sml. U]Jam 11-i v. Sto•• 11! Utl•r Pruesh 1 S. C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 789 While Appeal No. 441 of 1959 was pending, the petitioner also filed under Art. 226 of the Constitution a petition in the High Court of Alla.ha.bad, for a. writ of certiorari to qua.sh the assessment order dated December 20, 1958. That was dismiSBed on January 27, 1959, by the learned Judges on the ground that, as the assessee could contest the validity of the order in appropriate proce- edings under the Act, and as, in fact, an appeal had b~en filed, there was no ground for exercising the extra.ordinary jurisdiction under Art. 226. In this view, the learned Judges did not decide the case on the merits, but observed that the \"language of the notification might well be read as meaning that the notification is to apply only to those goods on which an additional Central excise duty had been levied and paid.\" The petitioner then field an application under Art. 133 of the Constitution for certificate for appeal to this Courts against the above order, and that was granted. But instead of pursuing that remedy, the petitioner has chosen to file the present application under Art. 32 chall- enging the validity of the order of assessment date- ed December 20, 1958. It is alleged in the petition that t.he imposition and levy of tax aforesaid \"amounts to tP,e infringement of the fundamental rights of the petitioner to carry on trade and busineSB guaranteed by Art. 19 (1) (g) of the Cons- titution,\" and that it is further \"an illegal confisoa- tion of property without compensation and contra- venes the provisions of Art. 31 of the Constitu- tion.\" The prayer in the petition is that this Courts might be \"pleased to issue- ( a) a writ of certiorari or other order in the na.ture of certiorari qua.ahing the ~order of the Sales Tax Officer, Al1ahabad, dated 20th December 1958; (b) a writ of mandamus directing the opposit.e parties not to realise any sales tax from the peti- tioner on the basis of the said order dated 20th Deoember, 1958.\" 196B Smt. Ujjam Bai v. Stet1 of Uttu Praduh .AiyarJ. 1962 Slilt. Ujja,. Bo; v. Sl•I• of Utltrr p •tfnh 790 SUPREME COURT .REPORTS (1963] No argument has been addressed to Ull that the impugned nrder of aEsessment is in contnven- tion of Art. 31. Such a contention would be wholly untenable in view of the decision of this Court in Ramjilal v. Inwme-t,ax Officer (') and Laxmanappa Hanumant,appa v. Union of India' ('), where it has been held that when tax is authorised by law as required by Art. 265, the levy is not open to attack under Art. 31 of the Constitution. Th whole of the argument on behalf of the petitioner is that the assessinen t order is unconstitutional as infringing Art. 19(1 )(g ). It is contended in support of this position that the Sales Tax Officer has misconstrued tlie notification dated December 14, 1957, in holding that exemption of tax thereunder is limited to biris OD which additional excise duty had b1 en levied, that as s result of such misconstruction tax he.6 been imposed which is unauthorised, and that constitutes an interference with the light of the petitioner to <'arry on business guarantePd by :Art. l9(l)(g). That is how the jurisdiction of this Court un<ler Art. 32 is invoked. To this, the answer of the respondents is that the Sales Tax Officer had correctly construed the notification in limiting the exemption to iroods on which additional euise duty had been paid The respondents fort her raise a preliminary o bjeotion to the maintainability of this petition on the ground that Jaws of taxation which are protected by Art. 26.'i fall outside the purview of Part III of the Constitution, and are not open to attack as infring- ing fundamental rights iruaranteed therein, 1tnd that even if they are subject to the restrictions in Part III, an order of assessment made by a tribunal acting iudicially under a statute which b intra i>ires such as the impugned order dat<'d DecPmber 20 1958. does not infringe Art. 19(1\\(g), and that, fur- ther, a petition un<ler Art.32 is not maintainable (1) [1951] S.C.R. 127. 136, 137. (2) (1\"55) 1 S.C.R 769, 772. l S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 791 for challenging it, even if it is erroneous on the merits. On these contentions, the points that arise for decision are whether taxa.tion laws are subject to the limitations imposed bv Part III; whether th~ order of assessment dated December 20, 1958, is in contravention of Art. 19(l)(g); and whether it can be impugned in a. petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution. The first question that fa.Hs to be considered is whether the restrictions imposed in Part m of the Constitution have application to taxation laws. The contention of the respondl\"nts is that ·taxation is a topic which is dealt with sepa- rately in Pa.rt XII of the Constitution, that the governing provision is Art.265, which enacts that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of la.w, that when there is a law authorising the imposition of tax and that does not contravene any of the inhibitions in Part XII, then the lery there- under cannot be attacked as infringing any of the fundamental rights declared in Pa.rt III. In support qf thi.s contention, the following observations in Ramjil,al,'s case (1) were relied on: \"Reference ha.a next to be ma.de to article 265 which is in Part XII, Chaptt•r I, dealing with · 'Finanoe''. That article provides th11t ·tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law. There was no similar provision in the correspond in~ chapter of the Government of India. Act, 1935. If collection of taxes amounts to de.privation of property within the meanin~ of Art. 31(1), then there was·no point in making a. separate provision again as ·has been made in article 265. It, therefore, follows tha.t clause ( 1) of Article 31 must be regarded as concerned with deprivation of propert.y otherwise thnn by the imposition or collection or tax, for otherwise article 265 becomes (I l (1951) S C.R. 127, 136, 137. 1161 Smt U'J]tD11 Bai '· S~lefUtlti' PNll'ish A.iyar J. 19'2 Sml. Ujjam Bai v. Sl•I• of UUar Pra'4sh 792 SUPREME COtmT REPORTs [1963) wholly redundant. In the United States of America the power of taxation is regarded aa distinct from t,he exercise \"of police power or eminent domain. Our Constitution evidently has also treated taxa- tion as distinct from compulsory acquistion of property and has made independent provisition giving protection &gainst taxation save by authority of law ......... In our opinion, the protection against imposition and collectiol} of taxes save by authority of law directly comes from article 265, and is not secure<:l. by clause (1) of Article 31. Article 265 not being in Cha.pter III of the Constitution, its protec- tion is not a fundamental right which can be enforced by an applicAtion to this court under article 32. It is not our purpose to say that the right secured by article 265 may not be enforced. It may certainly be enforced by adopting proper proceedings. All that we wish to state is that this application in so far as it purports to be founded on article 32 read with article 31 ( 1) to this court is misconceived and must fail.\" A similar decision was given in LaxmanaJYP<J Hanurnant.appa v. Union of lntlMt (1). Where an order of assessment made in November, 1953, was attacked in a petition under Art. 32 on the ground that the Act under which it was made, viz,, the Taxation on Inoome (Investigation Commission) Act (30 of 1947) was void under Art. 14 of the Constitution. !{ejecting this contention, Mahajan, C. J., delivering the Judgment of the Court, obser- ved: \"The assessment orders under the Income- tax Act itself were made against the petitioner in November. 1953. In these circumstances (I) (1955) I s.c.R. 769, 772. I l S.C.R. SUPREME OOORT REPORTS 793 we are of the opinion that he is entitled to no Pelief under the provisions of article 32 of the Constitution. It was held by this Court in Bamji'lal v. lncome1f.az Officer, Mohindergarh(1) that as there is a. specie.I provision in article 26.5 of the Constitution that no tax shall be levied or collected accept by authority of law, clause (1) of artiole:&l must therefore be r6gar- ded as concerned with deprivation of property otherwise than by the iimposition or collection of taix, and ina~muoh as the right conferred by article 265 is not a right conferred by Part III of the Constituiion, it could not be enforced under article 32.\" The argument of the re~pondents based on the a.hove decisions is tha.t a law imposing a ta.x enacted by a. competent Jegisla.tur~ .is not open to atta.1:k under the provisions of Pa.rt III. The contt>ntion of the petitioner, on the other hand, is that a. law of taxation is.also subject to the limitations prescribed in Part III of the Constitu- tion, and the recent decision of this Cour:t in K. T. MoopilNair. v. The 8wte of Keral,a ( 2) ie relied on in support of it. There, the question was whether the provisions of the Tra.vanoore-Coohin Land Tax Act 15 of 1955, as amended by the 'l'ra..vanoore- Ooohin Land Tax (Amendment) Act 10 of 1957, contravened Art. 14 of the Constitution. The Court wurof:the opinion that the.y did. Then the conten- tion WAS raised that in view of Art. 265 the legisla- tion wae not open to attaok .under therprovisions of Pa'dt III. •In repelling this contention, the Co.urt Observed: \"Article 265 i~poses a. limitation on the ta.zing power of the State in so far as it prov:ides that. the State sba.11 not levy or collect a tax, except by authority of law, that (I) (19Sl) S.(;.R. 127, 136, 137.

It has to be done by authority of law, which must mean valid law. In order that the law may be valid, the tax proposed to be levied must be within the legislative competence of the Legislature imposing a tax and authorising the collection thereof and, secondly, the tax must be subject to the conditions laid down in Art.13 of the Constitution. One of such conditions envisa- ged by Art. 13( 2) is that the Legislature shall not make any law which takes away or abrid- ges the equality clause in Art. 14, which enjoins the State not to deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protec. tion of the laws of the country. It cannot be disputed that if the Act infringes the provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution, it must be struck down as unconstitutional.\" In the result, the impugned legislation was struck down as unconstitutional. It might appear at first sight that this decision is in conflict with the decisions in Ramjilal's case (1) and Laxmanapp's case ('). But when the matter is closely examined, it will be seen that it is not so. In Ramjilal's case (1) and in Laxmnappa's case('), the contention urged was that the tax which is duly authorised by valid legislation a.s required by Art. 265 will still be bad under Art. 31(1) a.s a.moun- ting to deprivation of property. This was negatived, and it was held that Art. 31(1) had no application to a law, which was within the protection afford- ed by Art. 265. There are observations in the above decisions which might be read a.s meaning that taxation la.we a.re altoirether outside the opera- tion of Pa.rt III. But, in the context, they have reference to the application of A~ 31(1.). In (I) ( 1951) s.c.R.127. 156, IS7. (2) ( 1955) I S.C.R 769. 17Z. 1 S.C.R SUPREME OOURT REPORTS 795 Moopil Nair's oase (1), the contention urged was that even though a taxing law might be discrimina- tory. it was not open to attach under Art. 14 by reason of Art. 265. In negativing this conten- tion, this Court held that a law which authorised the imposition of a tax under Art. 265 was also a law within Art. 13, and that, therefore, if it con- travened Art. 14 it was liable to be struck down. This decision js clearly an authority for the posi- tion that laws of taxation must also pass the test of the limitations prescribed in Part III of the Constitution. But it is not an authority for the position that a.11 the provisions contained in Part III are necessarily applicable to those laws. It did not decide contrary to Ramjilal's case ( 2) and LaxmJJnappa's Qase.(3) that Art.31(1) would apply to a taxation law, which is otherwise valid. In our judgment. the correct position in law is that a taxation law infringes a. fundamental right cannot be shut. out on the ground that Art. 265 grants immunity to it from attack under the provisions of Part III, but that whether there has been infringe- ment must be decided on a consideration of the terms of the particular Article, which is alleged to have been infringed, It is on this reasoning that taxation laws were held in Rumjilal's case (2) and in LaxmJJooppa's case C) to be unaffected by Art. 31(1), whereas in Moopit Nair's case (1 ) tht1y · were held to be within the purview of Art. 14. In this view. the ·question that arises for decision is whether Art. 19(1) (g), which is alleged to have been infringed, is applicable to a sales tax law which bas been enacted by a competent legislature and which is not otherwise Ultra vires. Article 19(1) (g) enacts that all citizens have the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or busines~.

Ujjam Bai •• Stat1 oj Uttar Praderh 796 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963J assume for the purpose of the prosent diaoussion that the sales tax statute in question is within the competenca of the legislature and is not ultra vires. Where a law is passed by a legislature which has no competence to enact it as when a States Legislature imposes what is in substance, a tax on income, a subject which is within the exclu- sive competence· of the Centre under Entry 82, that legislation has no existence in the eye of 'law and any levy of tax under the provisions of that law will not be within the protection afforded by Art. 265, and will, in consequence, be hit by Art. 19( 1) (g). The same result would follow when a law though disguised as a taxation law, is, in substance a law which is intended to destroy or even burden trade and not to raise revenue. That is colourable legislation which cannot claim the benefit of Art. 2tl5, and it must be held 'to contravene Art. 19(1) (g) unless saved by Art. 19(6). But where the law in within the competence of the legislature and i9 otherwise valid and is not colourable can it be said that it is liable to b~ attacked as infringing Art. 19(1) -(g)? The.object of the legislation is not to prevent the dealer from carrying on his business. Far from it it envi· sages that the tra'ler will carry on his business and carry it on a large scale so that the State might iiarn the tax. It. is, therefore, difficult to conceive how a sales tax law can fall within the vision of Art. 19(1) (g). Arts. 19(1) (f) and 19(1) (gl are in the same position as Art. 31 ( 1 ). They all of them enact that the citizen shall have the right to hold property or to carry on business without interference by the State. If Art. 31( I) is as held in Ramjilal'Bcase (1) and Laxamanappa'B case (') inapplicable to taxation laws, Arts. 19(1) (f) must on the same reasoning also be held to be inappli- cable to such la.ws. (I) (1~51) S.C.R. 127, 136, 137. (2) ( 1955) I S.C:lt. 769, 772. 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 797 The question can also be considered from another standpoint. Art.19(1) (g) and Art. l!J(6) from parts of one law which has for its object the definition of the fundam~ntal right of a citizen to carry on bueiness. Article 19( l) (g) declares that right. and Art. 19(6) prescribes its limits. The two provisions together make-up the whole of the fundamental right to carry on business. If a taxation law is within Art. 19(1) (g) it must also be capble of being upheld as a reasonable restric- tion under Art. 19(6). But can imposition of a tax be properly said to be a restriction on the carry- ing on of trade within Art. 19(6)? It is only if that is so that the question of reasonableness can arise. If the imposition of sales tax is a restric- tion on the carrying on of business then the imposi- tion of income tax must be that even to a greater degree. Likewise land tax must be held to be a res1'riotion on the right of a citizen . to hold property guaranteed by Art. 18(1) {g). Indeed it will be impossible to conceive of any taxation law which will not be a restriction under Art. 19(1) (fj or Art. 19(1) (g). It is difficult to imagine that that is the meaning which the word ''restri- ction\" was intended to bear in Arts. 19(5) Hind (6). That this is not the correct interpretation to be put on the word \"restriction\" will be clear when Art. 19(6) is further. examined. Under that provi- sion, the question whether a restriction is reason- able or not is one for the determination of the Court and tha.t determination has to be made on an appreciation or the facts established. If it is to be held th11it taxation laws a.re within Art. 19(1) (g) then tbe qut'lstion whether they are reasonable or not becomes justiciable and how is the Court to· judge whether they are · so or not ? Can tht1 Court say that\\hat the taxation is excessive and is unreasonable? What are t.he materials on which the matter could be decided, and what are the criteria on which the decision thereon could 1962 Smt.

It would, therefore, seem that the reasonableness of taxation laws is not a matter which is justiciable and therefore they oould not fall within the purview of Arts. 19 (5) and (6). If it is to be held that taxation laws are within the inhibition enacted in Art. 19(2) (g), then all those laws must be struck down as unconstitu- tional, because they could never be saved under Art. 19(5) and Art. 12(6). It should be noted that Art. 19(1) (g) and Art. 19(6) form parts of one soheme and for a proper understanding of the one, regard must be had to the other, Article 19(1) (g) cannot operate where Art. 19(6) oannot step iµ and the considerations a.rising under Art. 19(6) being foreign to taxation laws Art. 19(1) (g) can have no application to them. We may now refer to the decisions of this Court where the question of a.pplioability of Art. 19(1) (g) to taxation laws has been consider- ed. Himmat/nJ, Harilal Metha v. The St,ate of Madhya Prade.sh (1) the question a.rose with refere· nce to a sales tax which was sought to be imposecl under explanation I~ to s. 2 (g) of the Central Provinces and Ber:u Sales Tax Act 21 of 1947, under which a sale was defined as a transaction by which property in goods which were aotually within the !State was transferred wherever the sale might have been made. That provision was held to be ultra vires the State Legislature. A dealer then filed an application under Art. 226 in the High Court of Nagpur questioning the vires of that provision and asking for appropriate writ. The State resisted the application on the ground that as there was a special machinery provided in the Act for questioning the assessment a. petition under Art. 226 was not maintainable. In rejecting this contention this Court-held that, \"Explanation II to seotion 2 (g) of the Aot having been deola.red ultra llirea. any (1) [19MJ s.c.a. 1122,1121. ' . 1 s.c.R.

Thie decision is a direct authority for the proposi- tion that when a provision in a taxing statute is ultra vires and void any action taken thereunder is without the authority of law, as required under Art. 265 and that in that situation Art. 19 (1) (g) would be attracted, This decision was approved in The Bengal Immunity Company Limired v. The State of Bihar (1). The facts of that case are that the appellant-Com- pany filed a petition under Art. 226 in the High Court of Patna for a writ of prohibition restraining the Sales Tax Officer from making an assessment of sales tax pursuant to a notioe issued by him. The appellant claimed that the sales sought to be asses- sed were made in the course of inter-State Trade that the provisions of the Bihar sales Act 19 of 194 7 which authorised the imposition of tax on such sales were repugnant to Art. 286(2) and vofol and that, therefore, the proceedings taken by the. Sales Tax Officer should be quashed. That application was dismissed by the High Court on the ground that if the Sales Tax Officer made an assessment which was erroneous the a.ssessee could challenge it by way of appeal or revision under ss.24 & 25 of the Act and that as the matter was within the jurisdiction of the Sales Tax Officer, no writ of prohibition or certiorari could be issued. There was an appeal against this (l) [l95S] 2. S. C.R. 603, 619, 620. 1111 -- Sm1. Ujjom Bai v. Slal1 of Vttat Pradl11t .)mt.

In rejecting this contention this Court observed: \"It ia however clear from article 265 that no tax can be levied or collected except by authority of law which must mean a good & valid law. The contention · of the appellant company is that the Act which authorises the assessment, levying and collection of Sales tax on inter state trade contravenes & constitutes an infringement of Art. 286 and is therefore ultra vires, void and unenforceable. If how- ever this contention be well founded the remedy by way of a writ must on principle and authority be available to the party aggrieved''. And dealing with the contention that the petitioner should proceed by way of appea,J or revision under the· A<'t, this Court observed: \"The answer to this plea is short and sim- plb, The remedy under the Act cannot be said to be adequate and is, indeed, nugatory or useless if the Act which provides for such reme<ly is itself ultra vires and void and the principle relied upon can, therefore, have no application where a party comes to Court with an allegation that his right has been or is beinii; threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra vires the powers of the legisla- ture which enacted it and as such void and prays for appropriate relief under article 226\". It will be seen that in this ease the queation arose with reference to a provision in the taxing statute, which was ultra 11ires, and the decision was only that any action taken under such a proYision - I S.C.R. SUPREME COUR1' REPOR11S 801 was without, ·the authority of law and was, there- fpr.e, an unoonstitutiona.l interference with the right to carry on business under Art. 19( l)(g). There is nothing, in these two decisions which lends any sup- port to the contention that, where the provision of law under which assessment is made i~ intra vires, the order is liable to be impugned as contravening Art. 19(1 )(g), if the order is, on the merits, erro- neous. fhat, howa.ver, was held in the decision ill Kailaa Nalh v. Swt.e of U. P. (1). In that case, a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution was filed in this Court challenging an order of assessment on the ground that the l:>a.les Tax Officer h.ad disallowed an exemption on a mis- construction of a notification issued under s. 4 of tfle U. P. Sales Tax Act, and that thereby the right of the petiti0ner to carry on business under Art. 19(l)(g) had been infringed. An objection waa taken that, even if the Sales Tax Officer had mis- construed the notification, no fundamental right of tJie petitioner had been infringed, and that \"the peti- tion was not maintainable, Overruling this conten- tfo.D, Govinda Menon, J., observed: \"If a.tax is levied ~thout due lega.~ autho• i:ity on any trade or business, then it. is open to the citizen, aggriev.ed to approach this G:lowt. for B writ under Art. 32, ''since his l'light to O&l'1')7 Gil a irade is violated, or. infring~ by the; impoaition ud suoh being. the oaae, Art. 19(l)(g) oomes into play~'~ In SURPOrt of this view, the obser.~atione in The Bengal lmmunib.J Oompany'a case ~;i) w,ere relied on.

But it is equally incon.· trovertible that the decision in The Bengal Immunity Company's case { 2), which it purports to follow, does not support it. There is a fundamental distinction between an order of assessment made on a provi- sion, which is ultra 'Vires, and one made on a valid provision, which is misconstrued. Where the provi- sion is void, the protection under Art. 265 fails, and what rt>mains is only unauthorised interference- with property or trade by a State Officer, and Arts. 19(1) (f) and (g) are attracted. But where the provision itself is valid, Art. 265 operates, and any action taken thereunder is protected by it. . An authority having jurisdic- tion to decide a matter has jurisdiction to decide wrong as well as right, & the protection afforded by· Art. 265 is not destroyrd, if its· decision turns out to be erroneous. To such cas~s, Art. 19(I){g) has no application. Both in Himmaflal' s case ( •) and in Bengal Immunity Company's case (') the decision of the Court that the proceedings constitu- ted an infringement of the rights of the citizen under Art. 19(l)(g) was based expressly on the ground that Art. 265 did not apply to those proceedings. But this ground did not exist in Kailash NafJl's caae (6), and that makes all the difference in the legal posi- tion. The decision in Kailash Nath's oase (6) which merely purported to follow Tlie Bengal, Immunity Company's case ('), is open to the criticism that it has overlooked this distinction. We may now refer to two decision subsequent to the one in .Kailask Nath oase (1), which have been relied on by the petitioner. In Tata Iron and 8f£el Co., Lf,t},. v. 8. R. S~rkar (•), the ques- tion arose under the Central Sales Tax Act. Under tbat Act, sales in the course of inter-State trade are (I) AIR 1957 S.C. 790, 792, 793. (2) (1955) 2.

Thereafter, the Central Sales Tax Offioer in West Bengal ~ade an order assessing to tax the very sales in respect of whioh tax had been paid. The petitioner then moved this Court under Art. 32 for an order quashing the order of assessment. A preliminary objection to the maintainability of the pe~ition_ was taken on behalf of the respondent State on the ground that, under the Act the petitioner could file a.n appeal against the order of asseBBm:ent, . and that proceedings under .Art.32 were, thJefore, incompetent. In overruling this contention, Shah, J., referred to the decisions of this Court in Himmatlal's case (1), Bengal Immunity Ootnl/)(J,ny' s case ( 2) and The Sfllt,e of Bombay v. U nitJ!,d Motors (India) Ltd (') and observed; ••In these cases, in appeals from orders passed by the High Courts in petitions under Art. 226, this Court held that an attempt to levy tax under a statute which was 'Ultra virea, infringed the fundamental right of the citizens, and recourse to tile High Court for proteotion of the fundamental right was not prohibited because of the provisions contained in Art. 265.

Dealing with this- point, Sarkar, J., observed in the ea.me case: \"This Court held that an illegal levy of sales tax on a trader under an Act the legality of which was not challen'ged viola~ his fundamental rights under -Art. 19(1) (g) and a petition under Art. 32 with respect to such violation lies.

It is clear from the above observations th'l.t the learned Judges were of the opinion that t,he decision in Kailash Nath' s <Jll8e ( 1) required reconsideration. The ratio of the decition in Tat,a Iron and St,eeJ, Go. Ltd. v. S.R.

In the p~esent case, there is no contention that the prooee<ii.ng11 of the Sales Tax officer a.:ce without juriediotion. The. petitioner also relied on a recent !Meision Ill A.T.ll. 1957 SC 790, 792, 793. (2l- (19611 I S.C R. 379 !Jl3, 402. - I S.C.R. SUt>REME OOURT REPORTS 865 of this Court in Bhri Madanla/, Arora v.

The assessee thereupon applied to this Court under Art. 32 for quashing the proeeedings on the ground tha.t they were without jurisdiction, and it was held that, as the taxing authority had no pow~r under the statute to issue the notice in question, the proceedings must be quashed. This a.gain is a. case, in which the authority had no jurisdiction under the Act to take proceedings for assessment of tax, and it makes no difference that such assumption of jurisdiction was ·based on a misconstruction of statutory provisions. In the present case, we ar& concerned with an alleged misconstruction, which bears on the merits of the assessment, and does not affect the jurisdiction of the Sales Tax Officer to make the assessment, and the two are essentially different. And we should add that the present question wn not raised or decided in that case. It remains to refer to the decision in M oopil Nair's case ( 2 ), which has been already discussed in connection with Art. 14. In that. case, the provisions of the Trava.ncore-Cochin Land Tax Act 15- of J 955 as amended by the Travanoore-Cochin Land Tax (Amendment) Act 10 of 1957, were held to be'bad as ·violative also of Art. 19 (l) (f). As the considerations e.pplioable to Ans. 19 (1) (f) and 19 (l~ (g) are the same, we should have to examine the ground on which this decision rests. They were, thus stated: •'Ordinarily, a taxing statute Jays-down a regular machinery for making assessment of the tax proposed to be imposed by the statute.

For these reasons, as also for the reasons for which the provisions of ss. 4 and 7 have been declared to be unconstitutional, in view of the provisio- ns of Art. 14 of the Constitution, all these operative sections of the Act, namely, 4, 6A and 7, must be held to offend Art. 19 (1) (f) of the Constitution also.'' From tJie above observa.tfons, it will be -n that the ground on which the law was held to be in contrav,ention of Art. 1 9 ( l) (f) wu not one which had any reference to the merits of the assessment but to the procedure laid down for imposing tax. This decision is an authority only for the position that, where the prooedure laid down in a taxing statute is oppoaed to rulee of natural justice, then any i'llposition of tax under auoh a prooedure DlUSt be beld to vto1-te Art. llf (1) (f). i s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 807 Reference may be made to the following passage in Willoughby's Constitution of the United States, Second Edn, Vol. 3, p. 1718 relied on for the respondents : \"It is established that the guaranty to suitors of due process of law does not furnish to them a right to have decisions of courts reviewed upon the mere ground that such decisions have been based upon erroneous findings of fact or upon erroneous determina- tions of law. Such errors, if committed by trial courts, can be corrected only by ordinary appeJlate proceedings as provided for by law. Especially bas this doctrine been declared in cases in which the Federal Courts have been asked to review the decisions of State courts\". Our attention was also invited to the decisions in Mc Govern v. New York (1) and Amerioan Railway Express Oo. v. Kentucky ( 2). It was observed in the latter case: ''It is firmly e.Jtablished that a merely erroneous decision given by a State court in the regular course of judicial proceedings does riot deprive the unsuccessful party of proper· ty without due process of law.\" The above remarks support the contention of the respondent that an order of a Court or tribunal is not hit by Art. 19 (i) (g). The result of the authorities may thus be summed up: (1) A tax will be valid only if it is authorised by a law enacted by a competent legislature. That is Art. 265. {I) [19131 229 U.S. 363.

Now, the question is, when a law is enacted by a oompetent legislature and it is not unconstituti- onal as contravening any prohibition in the Consti- tution such as Art. 14, and when proceedings for assessment of tax are taken thereunder in the manner provided therein, and there is no violation of rules of natural justicP, does Art. 19 (I )lg) apply, even though the taxing authority might have, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, misconstrued the legal provisions?

SUPREME OOUBT REPORTS 8@9 that its correctness is open to question and the point ·needs reconsideration. There is another objection taken to the maintainability of this petition. Art. 32, under which it as presented, confers on a person, whose fundamental right guaranteed in Pa.rt III is infring- ed, a right to move this Court for appropriate writs for obtaining redress. 1.1he contention of the petitioner is that the order of assessment dated December 20, 1958, amounts to interference with the rigl\\t of the firm to carry on busineeis and is, href~re, in collWavention of Art. l9 (l} (g), and that reoJief Bbduld be'gra.nted under Art. 32.

The answer of the petitioner· to· this is that the word \"State\" comprehends all the three organs, the Executive, the Legislature. and the· Judiciary, that . the express mention of the Governinent and the Legislature in Art. 12 cannot·' be construed as <\"Xclu· ding the Judiciary, that the uiie of the word \"iuclu- des\" shows that. the enumeration which followsia not exhaustive, and that, therefore, the 'ordinary •. · ····· and the wider connotation of the word· ••State' is not cut down by Art. 12. ' ... It is true that the word ••includes\" ~ormally ·signifies that what is enumerated as included is not J ·---._..- • • 1 S.C.R. SUPREME cOuRT REPORTS sit exhaustive. But the question ultimately· is, what is the intention of the Legislature, and that has to be . gathered on a reading of the enactment as a whole. It is possible that in some context the word \"includes\" might import that the enumeration is exhaustive. The following observations - of Lord Watson in Dilworth v. Commissioner of St,amps (1) were relied-upon:; - ---· · .- , · \"The word 'include' is very generally used in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute; and when it is so used these words or phrases must be construed as comprehending, not only such thing3 as they signify according to their natu\" ral import, but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include. But the word 'include' is susceptible of another construction, which may become imnerative, if the context of the Act is sufficj. ent to show that it was not i:nerely employed for the purpose of adding to the natural significance of the words or _expressions defi· ned. It may be equivalent to 'mean and include,' and in that case it may afford an exhaustive explanation of the meaning which, for the purposes of the Act, must invariably be attached to these words or expressions.\" ·. Now, when tho Legislature' wants to enlarge the sense in which an expression is generally, used so as to take in certain other things, it does so by ming the word \"includes\". Therefore, it may be argued that the word ••includes\" would be approp- riate only when the expression, the connotation of which is sought to be extended by the word \"inclu· des\", does not, in its ordinary sense; include_ . what is suught to be \"included'', and that as the (I) [1899] A.

S/41t.ofU11., Pritduh .di)ar \"· 812 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] Executive ·and the Legislature of a State are, according to all accepted notions, understood as included in the word \"State\", the use of the word \"includes\" with reference to them would make no sense. The Article ·also provides that the werd \"State'' is to include '~all local or other authorities\". With reference to them, the use of the word \"includes\" will be quite appropriate, because they would not in the ordinary sense of the words \"the State\", be understood as inclu<led therein. A reading of the Article, as a whole, would seem to show that the intention of the Legislature ·was; on. the one hand, to restrict the sccepted connotation of the word \"State\", and, on the other hand, to extend it by induding \"local or other authorities\". There is much to be said in favour of the contention of the respondents that in the context the word \"includes\" must to be read as \"means and includes\". In further support of the contention that orders of Courts and Tribunals are not, in general, within the purview of Part III, the respondents rely on the definition of 'law' in Art. 13(3). Judgments and orders made in the course of judicial procee- dings do not fall within that definition. It is con- tended that the soheme of the Constitution is that, whenever there is an infringement of a fundamental right by the Executive or the Legislature, the per- son aggrieved has a right of resort to this Court under Art. 32, that being the consequenee of the definition of '.State' under Art. 12 and of •law' under Art. 13(3); that Courts and Cdbunals are not law-making bodies in the sense in which law is defi- ned in Art. 13(3), their function being to interpret law; and that it will, therefore, be inappropriate to bring them within Part III, which euact·s li:mita- tions on power to make laws. It is urged that the scheme of the Constitu- tion does no contemplate judicial orders being brought up before this Court in a petition under 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 813 Art. 32. Whenever a fundamental right is infrin- ged, it is said, the party aggrieved has a. right to resort to the Civil Courts either in their ordinary jurisdiction or under Art. 226, and the decisions of the Courts will ultimately come up to this Court on appeal under Arts. 132 to 136. Thus, when execu- tive and legislative action infringes fundamental rights, the Supreme Court oan deal with it under Art. 32, whereas orders of Courte and Tribunals, in which questions of infringement of fundamental rights are decided, will come up for review before the Supreme Court under Arts. 132 to 136. We may now refer to the decisions where this question has been considered by this Court. In Bashesker Nath v. The Commissioner of lnoome-tax ( 1 ) occur the following observations. relied on for the respondents: \"In the third place it is to be observed that, by virtue of Art. 12, 'the State' which is, by Art. 14, forbidden to discriminate between persons includes the Government and Parlia- ment of India. and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. Article 14, therefore, is an injunc- tion to both the legislative as well as the executive organs of the State and the other subordinate authorities. As regards the legisla- tive orga.n of the State, the fundamental right is further consolidated and protected by the provisions of Art. 13 ... That apart, the very language of Art. 14 of the Constitution expre- ssly directs that 'the State', by which Art. 12 includes the executive organ, shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the law. Thus Art. 14 (l} [1959) Supp. ( l) S.C.R. 528 551, 552. 1962 Smt. UJjam B.;. v. Stote of Uttar Praduh Apar J1 - 196t Sm,, Ujjom Bai v. Stat1 of Utlar PraJ1sli -·- 814 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] proteots us from both lei:islation, and executive tyranny by way of discrimination.\" The above remarks are based on the view that the words \"the State\" in Art. It comprehend only the Executive and the Legislature. A more direct deoision on this point is the one in S. 8. Md. Amirabbas Abbasi v. State of Madhya Bharat (1). There, the facts were that one Amirabbas Abbasi applied to the Court of the District Judge at Ratlam for an order that he should be appointed guardian of the person and properties of his two children. The application was rejected by the District Judge, who appointed another person, Sultan Hamid Khan, as the guar- dian. An appeal against this order to the High Court was also dismissed. Amirabbas Abbasi then filed a petition in this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution, challenging the validity of the order of the District Court on the ground that it was di11- criminative and violative of Art. 14 of the Constitu- tion. In dismissing this petition, this Court obser- ved: \"The second respondent was appointed guardian of the minors by order of a compe- tent court, and denial of equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws oan be claimed against executive action or legislative proceSB but not against the deoision of a com- petent tribunal. The remedy of a person aggrieved by the decision of a competent judicial tribunal is to approach for redreSB a superior tribunal, if there be one.\" The following observations in Ratilal v. State of Bombay (') are also relied on for the respondents: \"The second observation which must be made is that the protection ajforded b,Y tJu~ (1) [1960] 3. s. c. ~. 138, 142.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 815 Constitution to fundamental rights is against executive, or legislative interference, A deci- sion of a regularly constituted Court cannot however be ehallenged as an interference with fundamental rights in the abstract. The Court in the very nature of things adjudicates upon conflicting claims and declares rights and does not by the operation of its own order seek to · infring any Fundamental rights.\" These observations would appear to apply with equal force to judioial proceedings:before tribunals, as they cannot be . regarded as representing the executive or the~legislative function of the State. . \" It is next contended for the petitioner that the Salee Tax Officer will at least fall within the category of \"other authorities\" in Art. 12. The meaning of the expression \"other authorities\" was considered in The University of Madras v. Shantka Bai (1). There, the question was as to whether the University of Madras was \"other authority'' within that Article. In deciding that it was not, it observed that the words \"other authorities\" must be construed ejus<km generis with what had been enumerated in the Article, nemely, the Government or the Legislature. Thie clearly supports the res- pondents. It is contended for the petitioner that even if Courts· could not be held to be 11other authori- ties\", quasi judicial tribunals must be regarded as falling within that expression, and that Salee Tax Officers are at best only quasi judicial officers, and they cannot be put on the same footing as regular Courts. It is argued that sales tax authorities are Officers of Government to whom is entrusted the work of levy and coJlection of taxes, that that is primarily an executive function, that the officers have, no doubt, to a.ct judicially ip deterJllin~ th(' (1) I.A.Jt. 195f M•d, f,7, JIOB imt.

Io this view, it .is urged, the assessment order dated December 20, 1958, fa.Ile within the purview of Part III. The respondents dispute the correctness of this contention. They concede that a Sa.lee Tax O.ffioer has certain functions of an administrative charaeter, but urge that the proceedings with which we are concerned, are entirely judicial. In this connection-, it will have to be borne in miud that it is a feature well-known in the Government of this country that. ooth executive and judicial functions a.re vested in the same Officer, and because of the undesirable results-which followed from this combination, Art. 50 of the Constitution has enacted as one of the Directive Principles that, \"The State shall take steps to separ&te the judiciary from the executive in the public services of the State\". When an authority is clothed with two functions, one adruinistrative and the other judioial, prooeod- ings before it which fall under the latter category do not cease to be judicial by reason of the fa.et that it has got other non-judicial functions. What ha.a to be seen is the capacity in which the authority acts with reference to the impugned ma~ter. It will, therefore, be necessary to examine the character in which the Sales Tax Officer functions when he t&koa proceedings for aaseBSmeint of tax.. Under the pro- visions of the Act, the Sales Tax Offioer ha.a to i-e notice to the aBS08866, take evidence in the ma.Uer, hear him and then decide, in a.ooorda.noe with, tlae provisions of the statute, whether tax- is payable, and if so, how much. Against hie order, there,is an ,__l - .. ; .. I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 817 appeal in which again the parties have to be heard and a decision given in accordance with law. The legality or propriety of an order passed in an appeal id again open to consideration on revision by a Revising Authority who must be \"a person qualified under dause (2) of Art. 217 of the Consti- tution for appointment as Judge of a High Court\". Section ll, which is on the same lines as s. 66 of the Indian Income-Tax Act, providee that the Revi- sing Authority might refer for the opinion of the High Court any question of law arising out of its order, and under s. 11(4), the assessee has a right to move the High Court for an order that the Revising Authority do refer the question of law arising out of the order, if there ha11 been an erroneous refusal to refer. Now the respondents contend that the proceedings commencing with a notice iPsued by the Sales Tax Officer and ending wi~h a reference to the High Court are entirely judicial, that it is in that view that petitions for certiorari and prohibition are entertained against orders of assessment under Art. 226 of the Constitution, and appeals against such orders are entertained by this Court under Art. 136. It will be inconsistent, it is urged, to hold, on the one hand, that the orders passed in these assessment proceedings are open to appeal under Art. 136 on the footing that they are made by Tribunals, and, on the other, that they are open te attack under Art. 32 of the footing that they are ma.de by execu- tive authorities, It is also contended for the petitioner that the definition of \"State\" in Art. 12 is to govern Part JTI \"unless the context otherwise required\", and that in the context of Art. 32; \"The State\" wouH include Courts and Tribunals exercising judicial functions. Article 32, it will be noticed; confers ,~t,he Court jurisdiction to issue among others, ·~ii of Certiorari and prohibition. The argument l@ th~t as these writs are issued only with re- ference to judicial proceedings, the restricted 1961 Smt. Ujjam Bai •• Stale Df Utt r Ptadesh • 19'1 Smt. Ujjtm1 Bai v. Slot. of Ult., PrliUsh 818 SUPREME OOURT REPORTS [1963] definition of \"the State\" in Art. 12 as excluding them must give way to the express la.ngua.ge of Art. 32. It is accordingly contended that even on the footing that the order of assessment is judicial in character, the present petition for issue of certior- ari is within Art. 32. It is true argue the respon- dents, that certiorari and prohibition lie only in respect of judicial and not administrative acts, and it must, therefore, be taken that Art. 32 does envisage that there could be a petition under that Article with respect to judicial proceedings. It is also true, as held by this Court, that the right of an aggrieved party to resort to this court under that Article is itself a fundamental right under Art. J2. But the right of resort to this Court under Art. 32(1) is only when there is an infringe· ment of a fundamental right which had been gua- ranteed in Part III, that it is Articles 14 to 31 that declare what those, fundamental rights are, for the breach of which remedy can be had under Art. 32- (2), and that what has to be seen, therefore, is whether there is anything in the Article whioh is said to have been infringed, which is repugnant to the definition of ••the State\" in Art. 12. Examin- ing, it is said, Art.19( l)(g) which is alleged to have been violated, there is nothing in it which is repugnant to the restricted connotation of the ex- pression ••the State\" in Art.12, and judicial proceedings therefore cannot be brought within it. It is further argued that Art.19(2) to 19(6) clearly show that it is only laws existing and to be made that are within their purview, and judi- cial pronouncements not being law cannot fall within the ambit of those provisions. In the res- ult, it is contended that the definition of \"State\" in Art. 12 stands and an order made by a Court or tribunal cannot be held to infringe Art. 19(1) (g) read along with Art. 12. If that is the true position, 1eplies the peti- tioner, then what purpose is served by the provi- l s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 819 1B61 sion in Art. 32 that this Court might issue writs of certiorari or prohibition ? The answer of the res- pondents is that among the subst.antive enactments forming Arts. 14 to 31, there a.re Rome which are specially, directed against judicial proceedings, and the writ of certiorari or prohibition will lie Fmt. Ujjam B 1i v. Stale of UU,r Pr<stkslt in respect of them. One such, for example, is Art. 20, which is as follows: ''20. (1) No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the Act charged as an offence, nor be subjeo.ted to a penalty greater than that whioh might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. (2) No person shall be prosecuted a.nd punished for the same offence more than once. (3) No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.\" Thia Article clearly applies to prosecutions and convictions for offences. It bas reference~ there· . fore, to judicial proceedings, and the restricted definition of \"Sta.te'' in Art. 12 is, in the context, excluded. And prooeedings contemplated by Art. 20 being judicial, writs of certimari and pro· hibition can issue. In this connection, the respon- dents rely u~on the expression \"whichever may be appropriate' occurring in Art. 32(2). It means, it is said, that when once an infringement of a funda.menta.l rights is established, the writ which the Court can iBSue must depend upon the nature of the right involved. It is accordingly contended that Art. 19{l){g) is, on its terms inapplicable to judi- cial proceedings, and no writ of certiorari can issue for the infringement of a. right under that Article. It was alJto argued for the petitioner tli~t Aiyar J. Sml. Ujj.., Bid Y. St.ii •I Utt., p,tuf,1h 820 SUPREME OOURT REPORTS (1963] under the American law certiorari lies against deci- sions of the i:-tate Courts when they ·are repug· nant to the provision of the Constitution, and the decision in National Association for the Advance· ment of Colored People v. State of Alabama (') was relied support of this position. There the question related to the validity of a provision in a statute uf Alabama requiring foreign corporations to disclose, among other things, the names and addresses of their local members and agents. The appellant-Corporation having made default in complying with this provision, the State insti- tuted an action for appropriate relief, and the Court granted the same. Then the Corporation moved the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari on the ground that the provision in the statute was an invasion of the right to freely assemble, guaran· teed by the Constitution. One of the grounds on which the State resisted the application was that no certiorari will lie for quashing an order of Court. In rejecting this contention, the Court observed' \"lt is not of moment that the State has t,here acted solely through its judicial branoh for whether legislative or judicial, it is still the application of state power which we are asked to scrutinize.\" It is unnecessary to refer to other decisions in which 11imilar view~ have been taken. The principle on which all these decisions are based was thus stated in Virginia v. Rives (') : \"It is doubtless true that a State may act through different agencies,-either by its legiBlative, its executive, or its judicial auth· oritiee ; and the prohibitions of the amend- ment extend to all action of the State deny- ing equal protection of the laws, whether (II (1958) 2 L. ed. 2d. 1488. 1500, 357 U- S. 449.

I have reached the Sil.me conclusion as has been reached by my learned brother. But in Tiew of the importance of the question raised, I would like to state in my own words the reasons for reaching that conclusion. The two questions which have been referred to this larger Bench are: 1. Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is Intra virllll, open to challenge as repugnant to Art. 19 (1) (gl, on the sole ground that it is based on a misconstruction of a provision of the Act or of a notification issued there under? 2. Can the validity of such an order be questioned in a petition under Art. 3.2 of the Constitution ? These two questions are inter-connected and substantially relate to one matter: is the valid- ity of an order ma.de with jurisdiction under an Act which is Intra virllll and good law in all respects, or of a notification properly issued thereunder, liable \\o be questioned in a. petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution on the sole ground that the provisions of the Act, or the terms of the notification issued thereunder, have been misconstrued? It is necessary, perhaps, to start with the very Article, namely, Art. 32, with reference to which the question has to be answered. \"32. (l) The ri!!'ht to move thfl Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed. (2) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs, J96t Smt. Ujjam B.ii v. Statt of Ultar Pradtsla DasJ. 824 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] in any court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned shall remain suspended etc. It is clear, therefore, that so Joni;: as no order is made by the President to suspend the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution every person in India, citizen or otherwise, ha• the guar- anteed right to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of the rights conferred on him by Part III of the Constitution and the Supreme Court has the power to issue neceSBary direct- ions, orders or writs which may be a.pp· ropriate for the enforcement of such rights. Indeed, this Court bas held in more than one deci- sion that under the Constitution it is the privilege and duty of this Court to uphold the fundamental rights, whc>never a person seeks the enforcPment of Ruch right•. The oath of office which a Judge of t.f1e Supreme Court takes on assumption of office con· ta.ins infer alia a solemn affirmation that he will \"uphold the Constitution and the laws\". The controversy before us centres round the expression \"enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part\" which occurs in els. (!}and (2) of the Article. It has not been disputed before us that this Court is not trammelled bv technical considera- tions relating to the issue of writs habeas corpus mandAJmus, Prohibition, quo warranto and certiorar( This Court said in T. 0. Basappa v. T. Nngnppa (I): \"In view of the express provisions in our ConHtitution we need not now look back to the early history or the procedural technicali- ties of these writs in English law, nor feel oppressed by any difference or change of opinion expressed in particu Jar cases by English Judges.

SUPREME COURT RFPORTS 825 1110 long as we keep to the broad and funda- mental principles that regulate the exercise of jurisdiction in the matter of granting such writs in English law,\" Therefore, apart altogether from all technical consi· derations, the broad question before us is-in what circumstances does the question of enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution arise under Art. 32 of the Constitution, remembe- ring all the time that the constitutional remedy under Art. 32 is itself a fundamental right? On behalf of the petitioner it has been submitted that whenever it is primu facie established that there is violation of a fundamental right, the question of its enforcement arises; for example, (a) it may arise when the statute itself is ultra vfres and some action is taken under such a statute, or (b) it may also arise when some action is taken under an intra vires statute,but the action taken is without jurisdic- tion so that the statute though intra vires does not support it; or ( o) it may again arise on misconstruc- tion of a statute which is intra vires, but the mis- construction is such that the action taken on the misconstrued statute results in the violation of a fundamental right. It has been argued before us that administrative bodies do not cease to come within the definition of the word ''State\" in Art. 12 of the Constitution when they perform quasi-judicial functions and in view of the true scope of Art. 32, the action of such bodies whenever suoh action violates or threatens to violate a fundamental right gives rise to the question of enforcement of such right and no distinction can be drawn in respect of the three classes of cases ref erred to above. As to the case before us the argument is that the taxing authorities misconstrued the terms of the notifica- tion which was issued by the State Government on December 14, 1957 under s. 4(1)(b) of the United Provinces Sales Tax Act, U.P. Act No. XV of 1948 and as a result of the miscon-::.truction, they 19~1 Smt, U:ijam Bai v, State of Uttar Pradesh 1961 ~mt. Ujj•m Bai •• St•t< •I Uuu Pr•d11J. • 826 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] have assessed the petitioner to sales tax on the sum of Rs. 4,71,541.75 nP. which action, it is submit- ted, has violated the fundamental right guaranteed to the petitioner under Art. 19(l)lf) and (g) and Art. 31 of the Constitution. The misconstruction, it is argued, may lead to a transgression of constitutional limits in different ways; for example, in a case where an inter-State transaction of sale is sought to be taxed despite the constitutional prohibition in Art. 286 of the Cons- titution as it etood previously, by wrongly holding that the transaction is intra-State, there is a trans- greseion of constitutional limits. Similarly, where a quasi-judicial authority commits an error as to a fact or issue which the authority has complete juris- diction to decide under the statute, but the error is of such a nature that it affects a fundamental right, there is again a transgression of constitutional limits. The argument is that there is no distinction in principle between these clf\\sses of misconstruc- tion of a statute, and the real test, it is submitted, should be the individuality of the error, namely, whether the error impinge on a fundamental right. If it does, then the person aggrieved has a right to approach this Court by means of a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution. On the contrary, the contention of the res- pondents which is urged as a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the petition in that on the facts stated in the present petition no question of the enforcement of any fundamental right arises and the petition is not maintainable. It is stated that the validity of the Aot not being challenged in any manner, every part of it is good law; ther1>fore, the provision in the Act authorising the Sales-tax Officer as a quasi-judicial tribunal to assess the ta.x is a valid provision and a decision ma.de by the said tribuniil strictly acting in exercise of the quasi-judi- cial power given to it must necessarily be a fully 1962 Smt. Ujjam Bai v. State of Uttar Pradesh AiJarJ. 828 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963) Agra and another (Civil Appeal No. 99 of 1961) in which Judgment is also being delivered to-day. The writ petition, however, has been referrt-d to a larger Bench for the decision of the two impor- tant constitutional questions relating to the scope of Art. :12, which I have stated earlier in this judg- ment. It is, therefore, necessary and proper that I ·should decide those two questions which undoubted- ly arise as a preliminary objection to the maintai- nability of the writ petition. I now proceed to a consideration of the main arguments advanced before us. On some of the aspects of the problem which has been debated · before us there has been very iittle disagreement. I may first delimit the filed where there has been agreement between the parties and then go on to the controversial area of disagreement. It has not been disputed beforA us that where the statute or a provision thereof is ultra vires, any action taken under suoh ultra vires provision by a quasi-judicial authority which violates or threatens to violate a fundamental right does give rise to a question of enforc.iment of that right and a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution will lie. There are several decisions of this Court which have laid this down. It is unnecessary to cite them all and a reference nee,d only be made to one of the earliest decisions on this aspect of the case, namely, Himmatlal Harilal Mehta v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1). A similar but . not exactly the same position arose in the Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihr1r ('). The facts of the case were that the appellant company filed a petition under Art. 226 in the High Court of Patna for a writ of prohibition restraining the Sales Tax Officer from making an assessment of sales tax pursuant to a notice iesued by him. The appellant claimed that the sales (I) [19541S.C.R.1122. (2) '.1955) 2 S.C.R. 60,, 619, 620. ' 1962 mt. Vjjam Bdi' •• Stai. of Utt.r Prad1sh 830 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963) be said to lie adequate and is, indeed, nugatory or useless if the Act which provides for such remedy is itself ultra vires and void and the principle relied upon can, therefore, have no application where a party comes to Court with an allegation that his right has been or is being threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it and as such void and prays for appropriate relief under article 226.\" It will be seen that the question which arose in that case was with reference to a provision in the taxing s_tatute which was ultra vires and the decision was that any action taken under such a provision was without the authority of law and was, therefore, an unconstitutional interference with the right to carry on business under Art. 19 (l)(f). In circumstances somewhat similar in nature there have been other decision of this Court which the violation of a fundamental right W&H taken to have been established when the assessing authority sought to tax a transaction the taxation of which came within a constitutional prohibition. Such cases were treated as on a par with those cases where the provision itself was ultra vires. The deci&ion in Bidi Supply Co. v. The Union of India (')arose out of a somewhat different set of facts. There the Central Board of Revenue transferred by means of a general order certain cases of the petitioner under s. 5 (7·A) of the Indian Income-tax Officer, District III, Calcutta, to the Income-tax Officer, Special Circle, Ranchi. It was held that an omnibus wholesale order of tranfer as was made in the case was not contemplated by the su b·section and, therefore, the impugned order of transfer which was expressed in general terms without reference to any particular case and {I) [1956) 2 S.C.R. 67. II I I i • ~ ( -( Ill{ l s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 831 without any limitation as to time was beyond the competence of the Central Board of Revenue. It was also held that the impugned order was discriminatory against the petitioner and violated the fundamental right guaranteed by Art. 14 of the Constitution. This decision really proceeded upon the basis that an executive body cannot, without authority of law, take action violative of a fundamental right a;nd if it does, an application under Art. 32 will lie. In that case no question arose of the exercise of a quasi-judicial function in the discharge of undoubted jurisdiction; on the contrary, the ratio of the decision was that the order pas9ed by the Central Board of Revenue was without jurisdiction. The decision was considered again in Pannal,al Binjraj v. Union of India ( 1 ) after further amendments had been made in s. 5 (7-A) of the India Income-tax Act, 1922 and it was pointed out that s. 5 (7-A) as amended was a. measure of administrative convenience and constitutionally valid and an order passed thereundet· could not be challenged as unconstitut- ionaJ. There are other decisions which proceeded on a similar basis, namely that if a quasi-judicial authority acts without jurisdiction or wrongly assumes jurisdiction by committing an error as to a collateral fact and the resultant action threatens or violates a fundamental right, the question of enforcement of that right arises and a petition under Art. 32 will lie. (See TafAJ !rem and Steel Co. Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar ( 2 ); and Madan Lal Arora v. The Excise and Taxation Officer, Amritsar ( 3 ). In Tat,a Iron and St,eel, Oo. Ltd. v. S.R. Sarkar( 2) the question arose under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. Under that Aot sales in the course of inter-State trade are liable to be taxed at a single point. The petitioner was assessed to tax on certain sales (1) (1957] S.C.R. 233. (2) [1961] 1 S.C.R. 379, 383. (3) [1962] 1S.C.R.8~3, lHt -- Smt. Ujj11m B•i Vo S t•ld oj Uttu Pradtsh 1962 Sm,. Ujjam Bai v. Slat• OJ Uttar Pradesh 832 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] falling within the Act by the Central Sales Tax Officer' Bihar, and .the tax was also duly paid. Thereafter the Central Sales Tax Officer in West Bengal made an order assessing to tax the very sales in respect of which tax had been paid. The petitio- ner then moved this Court under Art. 32 for an order quashing the assessment. A preliminary objection to the maintainability of the petition was taken on behalf of the respondent State on the ground that under the Act the petitioner could file an appeal against the order of assesament and that proceedings under Art. 32 were, therefore, incomp- etent. In overruling this contention Shah, J., referred to the decisions of this Court in Himmatlal Harilal Mehta'.~ case (lj, Be:nga/, Immuni- ty's Company's case(') and the State of Bombay v. United Motors (India) Ltd. (')and observed: \"In these cases, in appeals from orders passed by the High Courts in petitions under Art. 226, this Court held that an attempt to levy tax under a statute which was ultra vires infringed the fundamental right of the citizens and recourse to the High Court for protection of the fundamental right was not prohibited because of the provisions contained in Art. 265. In the case before us, the vires of the Central Sales Tax Act,1956, are not challenged; but in Kailash Nath v. The State of Uttar Pradesh (•) a petition challenging the levy of a tax was entertained by this Court even though the Act under the authority of which the tax was sought to be recovered was not challenged as ultra vires. It is not necessary for purposes of this case to decide whether the principal of Kailash Nath's case(') is inconsistent with the view expressed by this Court in Ramjilal v. Income-tax Officer, Mohindargarh (').\" <D [1954J s.c R. m2. (2) [195SJ 2 s.c.R. 603, 619, 620. (3) ll9~3] s.c.R. 1969. (4) A.I.R 1957 s.c. 790. (S) [1951] S.C.R. 127. , 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 833 The learned Judge then proceeded to hold that as there was under the Act a single liability and that had been disoha.rged, there could be no proceedings for the assessment of the same sales a seoond time to tax. The ratio of the decision would appear to be that a.s the law did not authorise the imposition of tax a second time on sales · on which tax had been levied and collected, proceedings for assessment a second time were without jurisdiction. In Madan Lal Arora's case(1) a notice for assessment was issued after the expiry of the period prescribed therefore by the statute. The a.ssessee thereupon applied to this Court under Art. 32 for quashing the proceedings for assessment on the ground the.t they were without jurisdiction and it was held that as the taxing authority had no power under the statute to issue the notice in question the proceed- ings were without jurisdiction and must be quashed. This again was a case in which the authority had no jurisdiction under the Aot to take proceedings for assessment of tax and it made no difference that such assumption for juriadiOtion was based on a misconstruction of statutory provision. It is necessary perhaps to refer here to another class of cases which have sometimes been characterised as cases of procedural Ultra vires. When a statute prescribes a manner or from in which a duty is to be performed or a power exercised, it seldom lays down what will be the legal consequences of failure to observe its prescriptions. The courts must, therefore, form- ul.i.te their own criteria for determining whether the procedural rules are to be regarded as man- datory in which case disobedience will render void or voidable what has been done, or as directory in which case disobedience will be treated as a mere irregularity not affecting t~ validity of what has been done. A quasi-judicial authority is under an obligation to act judicially. Suppose, it doea not (1) (1962) J S. C.R. 823. 1961 Sml. UjJam Bdi v. Skl'e of Utt.,,. hddash 196• Sml, UjjtUn Bai y. Std• •I Ull\" p, ... ,A 834 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] so act and passes an order in violation of the princi- ples of natural justice. What is the position then? There are some decisions, particularly with regard to customs authorities, where it has been held that an order of a quasi-judicial authority given in violation of the principles of natural justice is really an order without jurisdiction and if the order threa- tens or violates a fundamental right, an application under Art. 32 may lie. (See Sinha Govindji v. The Deputy ControUer of Imports & Exports, Madras(l) ). These decisions stand in a class by themselves and really proceed on the footing that the order passed was procedurally ultra vires and therefore without jurisdiction. So far I have dealt with three main classes of oases as to which there is very little disagreement: ( 1) where action is taken under an ultra virea st11tute; (2) where the statute is intra vires, but the action taken is without jurisdiction; and (3) where the action taken is procedurally ultra vires. In all these oases the question of enforcement of a funda- mental right may arise and if it does arise, an application under Art. 32 will undoubtedly lie. As to these three classes of cases there has been very little disagreement between the parties before us. Now, I come to the controversial area. What is the position with regard to an order made by a quasi-judicial authority in the undoubted exercise of its jurisdiction in pursuance of a provision of law which is admittedly intra vires ? It is necessary first to clarify the concept of jurisdiction. J urisdio- tiun means authority to decide. Whenever a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal is empowered or required to enquire into a question of law or fact for the purpose of giving a decision on it, its find- ings thereon cannot be impeached collaterally or on an application for certiorari but are binding until (I) 1962) IS. C. R. 54-0. .. I I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 835 reversed on appeal. Where a quasi-judicial author- ity has jurisdiction to decide a matter, it does not lose its jurisdiction by coming to a wrong conclusion whether it is wrong in law or in fact. The question, whether & tribunal has jurisdiction depends not on the truth or falsehood of the facts into which it has to enquire, or upon the correctness of its find- ings on these facts, but upon their nature, and it is determinable ''at the commencement, not at the conclusion, of the inquiry'. ( Rex v. Bolten(1)) Thus, a tribunal empowered to d*\"termine claims for compensation for loss of office ha.a jurisdiction to determine all questions of law and fact relating to the measure of compensation and the tenure of the office, and it does not exceed its jurisdiction by determining any of those questions. incorrectly but it hs.s no jurisdiction to entertain' a claim for reinstatement or damages for wrongful dismissal, and it will exceed its jurisdiction if it makes an order in such terms, for it has no legal power to give any decision whatsoever on those matters. A tribunal may lack jurisdiction if it is improperly constituted, or if it fails to observe certain essential preliminaries to the inquiry. But it does not exceed its jurisdiction by basing its decision upon an in- correct determination of any questipn that it is empowered or required (i.e.,) has jurisdiction to determine. The strength of this theory of juris- diction lies in its logical consistency. But there are other oases where Parliament when it empowers an inferior tribunal to enquire into certain facts intend to demarcate two areas of enquiry, the tribunal's findings within one a.rea being conclusive and with in the other area impeachable. ''The jurisdiction of an inferior tribunal may depend upon the ful- filment of some condition precedent or upon the existence of some particular fact. Such a fR.ct is collateral to the actual matter which the tribunal has to try and the determination whether it exists (I) [1841] l Q. B. 66; 74. 1111 Smt. Ujjam B•i y, S !llU of Ult•r Pr•itsb i962 Sml, Ujiam B 1i v. Statl oj Uttsr A(v•r J, 896 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1963) or not is logically prior to the determination of the actual question which the tribunal has to ky. The tribunal must itself decide :is to the collateral fa?t when, at the inception of an inquiry by a tribunal of limited jurisdiction, a challenge is made to its jurisdiction, the tribunal has to make up its mind whether it will act or not, and for that pur· pose to arrive at some decision on whether it ha~ jurisdiction or not. There may be tribunals which, by virtue of legislation constituting them, have the power to determine finally the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends; but, subject to that an inferior tribunal cannot, by a wrong decision with regard to a coll- ateral fact, give itself a jurisdiction which it would not otherwise po~sess.\" (Halsbury's Laws of Eng· land, 3rd Edn. Vol. II page 59). The character· istic attribute of a judicial act or decision is that it binds, whether it he right or wrong. An error of !ll.w or fact committed by a judicial or quaei- judicial body cannot, in gPneral, be impeached otherwise than on appeal unless the erroneous de- termination relates to a matter on which the juris· diction of that body depends. ihese principles govern not only the findings of inferior courts stricto sensu but also the findings of administrative bodies which are held to be acting in a judicial capacity. Sueh bodies am deemed to have been invested with power to err within the limits of their jurisdiction; and provided that they ket1p within those limits, their decisions must be accepted as valid unless set aside on appeal. Even the doctrine of res judicata has been applied to such decisions. (See Livingstone v.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 837 this Court said that although the rule of re,s judicata as enacted by s. 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not in terms apply to an award made by an industrial tribunal its underlying prin- ciple which is founded on sound_ public policy and is of universal application must apply. In Daryao v. The State of U. P. (1) this Court applied tba doctrine of res judicata in respect of application under Art. 32 of the Constitution. It is perhaps pertinent to observe here that when the Allahabad High Court was moved by the petitioner under Art. 226 of the Constitution against the order of a.SHessment. passed on a.n alleged misconstruction of the notification of December 14, 1957, the High Court rejected the petition on two grounds. The first ground given was that the petitioner had the alternative remedy of getting the error corrected by appeal the second ground given was expressed by the High Court in the following words: \"We have, however, heard the learned counsel for the petitioner on merits also, but we are not satisfied that the interpretation put upon this notification by the Sales Tax Officer contains auy obvious error in it. The circmnst&nces make the interpretation advan- ced by the learned counsel for the petitioner unlikely. It is admitted that even handmade biris have been subject to Sales Tax since long before the date of the issue of the above notification. The object of passing the Add- itional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Central Act No. 58 of 1957, was to levy an additional excise duty on certain important articles and with the concurrence of the State Legislature to abolish Sales Tax on those articles. According to the argu- ment of the learned counsel for the petitioner during the period 14th December, 1957, to (I) (1961] (2J S, c. A, S91. 1962 Sml. Ujjam B•I v. Stille of Uttar Prad1sh Smt.

We do not know why there should h!Lve been such an exemption. The language of the notification might well be read as meaning that the notification is to apply only to those goods on which a.n add- itional Central excise duty had been levied and paid.\" If the observations quoted a.hove mean that the High Court rejected the petition also on merits, a.pa.rt from the other ground given, then the princi- ple la.id down in Daryao v. The St.ate of U. P. (1) will apply and the petition under Art. 32 will not be maintainable on the ground of res jwU- c.ata. It is, however, not neoesaa.ry to pursue the question of re.a judicala any further, because I a.m restinir my decision on the more fundamental ground that a.n error of law or fa.ct committed by a judicial body cannot, in general, be impeached otherwise than on appeal unless the erroneous determination relates to a matter on which the jurisdiction of that body depends. In Malkarjun Narhari (') the Privy Council dealt with a oa.se in which a. ea.le took place after notice had been wrongly served upon a. person who was not the legal representative of the judgment. debtor's estate, and the executing court had errone- ously decided that he was to be treated a.s such represenfa.tive. The Privy Council said : \"In so doing the Court was exercising its jurisdiction. It made a. s!Ld mistake, it is true; but a. Court ha.a jurisdiction to decide wrong a.s well a.s right. If it decides wrong, the wronged party can only take the course prescribed by law for setting matters right; (1) 1961 2 S.C.A. 5q1, 12) (1950) t.ll. 279, A, 216, 225. ,. 1 S.C.R.

A transferee of the land from the evacuee then presented a pPtition under Art. 32 for restoration of the lands to her and complained of an infringement of her fundamental right, under Art. 19 ( 1) (f) and Art. 31 of the Cons· titution by the aforesaid orders under the Adminis- tration of Evacuee Property Act.

In this case it was contended that the decision of the Transport Authority in granting a permit for a motor carriage service had offended Art. 14 of the Constitution. This Court held that the decision of a quasi-judicial body, right or wrong, could not offend Art. 14. There are, however, two decisions which stand out and mast be mentioned here. A contrary view wa.s taken in Kaila$h Nath v. The State of U. P. (•) (1) [19~7) S.C.R. 701, 702. (2) [1960] 3 S C.R. 177. (3) A.I.R. [19S7] S.C. 790. 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 841 There. a question precisely the same as the one now before us had arisen. A trader assessed to sales tax had claimed exemption under certain notifica- tion R.lld·this claim had been rejected. Thereupon he had moved this Court under Art. 32. It was contended that the right to be exempted from the payment of ta.x wa.s not a fundamental right a.nd therefore, the petition under Art. 32 was not compe- tent. Tf\\i,s Court rejected that contention basing itself on Bengal I mm unity Company's case(l} and Bidi Supply Oo' s case ( 2 ). The two cases on which the decision was rested had clearly no application to the· questio~ der,ided. I have shown earliar that in both those oases the very statute under which action had .been taken was challenged as ultra vires. In Kailash Nath's case (3) the question was not considered. from the point of view in which it has been placed before us in the present case and in which it was considered in the four cases referred to above. Therefore, I · am unable to agree with the view taken in Kailash Nath'8 case (3). In Ramavatar Budhai Prasad v. Assistant Sales Tax Officer (' J the question raised was whether betel leaves were exempted from sales tax under certain provisions of· the C. P. & Berar Sales Tax Act. This Court agreed with the view of the asses- sing authority that they were not exempted. The question as to the maintainability of the application under Art. 32 was neither raised nor was it decided. This decision cannot, therefore, be taken as an authority for holding that an application under Art. 32 is maintainable even in respect of orders which are made in the undoubted exercise of juris- diction by a quasi-judicial ~uthority. Certain other decisions were also cited before us, namely, Thakur Amar Singkji v. State of Rajas- t}w,n (i); M/s. Mohanl,al Hargovind Dass v. The Stale (I l [19SS] 2 S.C.R. fi03, 619, 620.

These decisions fall under the category in which an execu- tive authority acts without authority of Jaw, or a quasi.judicial authority acts in transgression of a constitutional prohibition and without jurisdiction. I do not think that these decisions support the contention of the petitioner. In my opinion, the correct answer to the two questions which have been referred to this larger Bench must be in the negative. An order of asses- sment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires and in the undoubted exercise of its jurisdiction cannot be challenged on the sole ground that it is passed on a misconstruction of a provision of the Act or of a notification issued thereunder. Nor can the validity of such an order he questioned in a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution. Thti proper remedy for correcting an error in such an order is to proceed by way of appeal, or if the error is an error apparent on the face of the reoord, then by an . application under Art. 226 of the Constitution. It is necessary to observe here that Art. 32 of the Constitution does not give this Court an appellate jurisdiction such as is given by Arts. 132 to 136. Article 32 guarantees the fight to a constitutionid remedy and relates only to the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution. Unless a question of the enforcement of a fundamental right arises, Art. 32 does not apply. There can be no qut:stion of the enforcement of a fundamental right if the order challenged is a valid and legal order, in spite of the allegation that it is erroneous. I have, therefore, come to ihe conclusion that no question of the (I) [19SS] 2 S.C.R. .~O!I. (2) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 146. \\3) (19601 's. c. R. 852. (4) [1960] I s.c.R. 906. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 843 . enforeement of a fundamental right arises in this case and the writ petition is not maintainable. i It is necessary to refer to one last point. The petitioner's firrn had also filed an appeal on a certificate of the Allahabad High Court against the order of that Court dismissing their petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The appeal against that order was dismissed by this Court for non-prosecution on February 20, 1961. In respect of that order of dismissal the petitioner's firm has filed an application for _restoration on the ground that it had been advised that in view of a rule having been issued under Art. 32 of the Constitution, it was not necessary to prosecute the appeal. The petitioner's firm has prayed for condonation, of delay in filing the application for restoration of appeal. In my opinion no sufficient cause has been ma~e out for allowing the application for restorR.tion. The petitioner's firm had deliberately allowed the appeal to be dismissed for non-prosecution and it cannot now be allowed to get the dismissal set aside on the ground of wrong advice. Furthermore, in the appeal filed on behalf of M/s. Chhota.bhai Jethabhai Patel & Co. v. The Sales Tax Officer, Agra and another (Civil Appeal No. 99 of 1961) we have decided the question on merits and have held that the assessing authorities did not put a wrong construction on the notification in qusstion. KAPUR, J.-In this petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution which is directed against the order passed by the Sales Tax Officer, Allahabad, dated December 20, 1958, the prayer is for a. writ of certiorari or other order in the nature of certiorari quashing the said order, a. writ of mandamus against the respondents to forbear from realizing the sales tax imposed on the basis of the said Bmt.

Mohanlal Hargovind Das which carried on the business of manufacture and sale of handmade biris, their head office being in Jubbalpore in the State of Madhya Pradesh. They also carr.Y on business in U. P., and in that State their principal place of business is at Allahabad. Under s. 4 ( 1) of the U. P. Sales Tax Act (Act XV of 194i>) hereinafter called the 'Act', the State Government is authorised by a notifi- cation to exempt unconditionally under cl. (a) and conditionally under cl. (bi any specified goods, On December 14, 1957, the U. P. Government issued a notification under s. 4( l}(b) of the Act exempting cigars, cigarettes, biris and tobacC'o provided that the additional Central Excise Duties leviable under the Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act, 1957 (Act 58 of 1957) had been paid. This notification was subsequently modified and on November 25, 1958, another notification was issued unconditionally exempting from sales tax biris both handmade and machine-made with effect from July I, 1958. Tl:te exemption of biris from sales tax was conditional under the notification dated December 14, 1957, for the period December 14, 19.n, to June 30, l!J58, but was unconditional as from July 1, 1958. The petitioner's firm submitted its return for the quarter beginning April 1, 1958, to June 30, 1958, showing a gross turnover of Rs. 75,44,633 and net turnover of Rs. lll. The firm claimed that as from December 14, 1957, biris had been exempted from payment of sales tax which had been replaced by the additional central excise duty and therefore no tax was leviab\\e on the sale of biris. The requisite sales tax of Rs. 3.51 nP on the turnover of Rs. 111 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 845 was deposited as required under the law. The peti- tioner's firm also submitted its return for the periods December 14, 1957, 1;o December 31, 1957, and from January 1, 1958, to March 31, 1958. For the subsequent periods returns were made but those are not in dispute as they fell within the noti- fication of November 25, 1958. The Sales Tax Officer on November 28, 1958, sent a notice to the petitioner's firm for assessment of tax on sale of biris during the assessment period April l, 1958, to Jund 30, .H)58. On December 10, 1958, the peti- tioner's firm submitted an application to the Sales Tax Officer stating that no sales tax was exigible under the Act on the sale of biris because of the notification dated December 14, 1957. This pla.ce was rejected by the Sales Tax Officer and on December 20, 1958, he assessed the sales of t.he petitioner's firm to sales tax amounting to Rs. 4,71,541· 7 5nP. In his order the Sales Tax Officer held:- \"The exemption envisaged in this notifi- cation applies to deale,rs in respect of sales of biris provided that the additional Central Excise duties levia.ble thereon from the closing of business on 13-12-1957 have been paid on such goods. The assessees paid no such Ex0ise duties. Sales of biris by the assessees are therefore liable to sales tax\". Aga_inst this order the firm took an appeal under s. 9 of the Act to the Judge (Appeals) Sales Tax, Alla.ha.bad, being Appeal No. 441 of 1959, but it was dismissed on May 1, 1959. The petitioner's firm filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Allahabad challenging the validity of the order of assessment and demand by the Sales Tax Officer. This was Civil Miscellaneous Writ No. 225 of 1951-1 which was dismissed on January 27, 1D59 on the ground that there was another remedy open to the 1962 Sml, Ujjam Bai v.

The High Court also observed:- \" We have come to the conclusion that the Sales Tax Officer has not committed any ap- parent or obvious error in the interpretation of the notification of 14th December 1957\". Against the order,ofthe High Court an appeal was brought to this Court on a certificate under Art.133(l)(a). During the pendeney of the appeal this petition under Art. 32 was filed and rule was issued on May 20, 1959. Subsequently the appeal which had been numbered C-A. 572/60 was dismissed ·by a Divisional Bench of this Court for non-prosecution. An application has been filed in this Court for res- toration of the appeal and for condonation of delay. That matter will be dealt with separately. In the petition under Art. 32 the validity of the order of assessment dated December 20, 1958, is challenged on the ground that the levy of the tax amounts to \"infringement of the fundamental right of the petitioner to carry on trade and business guaranteed by Art. 19(l)(gi\" and further that it is an \"illegal consfiscation of property without pay- ment of compensation and contravenes the provi- sions of Art. 31 of the Constitution\". The prayers have .. !ready been set out above. As before the Constitution Bench which heard the petition a preliminary objection against the competency of the petitioner's right to move this court under· Art. 32 of the Constitution, was raised and the correctness of the decision in KailashNath v. The, St,ate of U.P. ,(1) was chl\\llenged, the Constitu- tion Bench because of that decision and of certain other decisions of this court and because of the im· portance of the question raised made the following order: (I) A.I.R. 1957 S. C. 790. 1 s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 84 7 \"The question thus debated is of conside- rable importance on which there has been no direct pronouncement by this court. It seems desirable that it should be authoritatively settled. We accordingly direct that the papers be placed before the Chief Justice for consti- tuting a larger Bench for deciding the two following questions: > 1. Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a. taxing statute which is intra vires open to challenge as repugnant to Art. 19(l)(g), on the sole ground that it is based on a misconstruction of a provision of the Act or of a. notification issued thereunder?\". 2. Can the validity of such an order be questioned in a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution?'' Tha.t is how this matter bas come up before this bench. ·. Before examining the rival contentions raised and the controversy between the parties it is neces- sary to state that ( i) in the present case we are not called upon to decide whether els. ( f) and (g) of Art. 19 are applicable to a taxing statute or to ex- press our preference for the view of this court ~s expressed in a. group of oases beginning with Ramjilal v. lncome-fAJx Qfficer, Mohindergarh(1) over the later view taken in the second Koohunni (2 ) case or K.

State of Ke.rala (3 ), (2) whether the word ·'State\" in Art. 12 of the Constitution Comprises judicial power exercised by courts and (3) the wider question whether Art. 32 is applicable in the case of infringement of rights by private parties.

The petitioner mainly relies on the decision of this Court in Kailash Nath v. St,ate ojU.P. eJ. The submission of the respondent, which was urged as a preliminary objection to the maintain- ability of this petition, was that the impugned decision of the Sales tax Officer does not violate any fundamental right. The respondent argued that if the constitutionality of the Act is not challe- nged then all its provisions must necessarily be constitutional and valid including the provisions for the imposition of the tax and procedure for assessment and appeals against such assessments and revisions therefrom would be equally valid. A decision by the Sales tax Officer exercising quasi-judicial power and ailting within his powers under the Act and within his jurisdiction must necessarily be ·valid and legal irrespective of whether the decision is right or wrong. There- fore an order of the Sales tax Officer even if erron- eous because of misconstruction of notification issued thereunder remains a valid and legal order and a tax levied thereunder cannot contravene fundamental rights and cannot be challenged under Art. 32. An aggrieved party must prooeed against the decision by way of appeal etc. as provided under the statute or in appropriate oases under Art. 226 of the Constitution and finally by appeal to this Court under Art. 136. For the order to 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORrs 84~ be valid a.nd immune from challenge under Art. 32, it is nece:3sary th'3refore that (l) the statute is intra vires in all respects; (~) the authority acting under it acts quasi-judicially ; (3) it acts within the powers given by the Act and within jurisdictfon; and (4) it does not contravene rules of natural justice. In Mulkarjun Bin ShidramaPpa Pasare 1 v. Narhari Bin Skivappa ('), Lord Hobhouse while dealing with an erroneous order of a court said: \"The Code goes on to say that the Court shall issue a notice to the party against whom execution is applied. It did issue notice to Ramlingappa. He contended that he was not the right person, but the Court, having received his protest, decided that he was the right person, and so proceeded with the execution. It ma.de a sad mistake it is true; but a Court has jurisdiction to decide wrong as well as right. If it decided wrong, the wronged party oan only take the course prescribed by law for setting matters right ; and if that course is not taken the decision, however wrong, cannot be disturbed.\" In an earlier case dealing with the revisional powers of the Court, Sir Barnes Peacock in Rajah Amir Hassan Khan v. Sheo Baksh Singh ( 2) said:- \"The question' then is, did the judges of the Lower Courts in this case, in the exer- cise of their jurisdiction, act illegally or with material b:regularity. It appears that they had perfect jurisdiction to decide the question which was before them, and they did decide it. Whether they decided it rightly or wrong- ly they had jurisdiction to decide the case ; and even if they decided wrongly, they did not exercise their jurisdiction illegally or with • material irregularity\". {I) [1900] L.R.. 27 I.A. 2I6.

SlaJe of Uttaf' Pradesh KapurJ. 850 SUPREME COURT REl'OB.T5 (1963] This principle has been accepted by this Court in cases to which reference will be made later in this judgment. Although these cases were dealing with the decisions of Courts they are equally applicable to decisions of quasi-judicial tribunals because ill both cases where the authority has jurisdiction to decide a matter it must have jurisdiction to decide it rightly or wrongly and if the decision is wrong the aggrieved party can have recourse to the pro- cedure prescribed by the Act for correcting the erroneous decision. Now Art. 32 is a remedial provision and is itself a fundamental right which entitles a citizen to approach this court by an original petition in any case where his fundamental right has been or may be infringed. The relevant part of the Artiole provides :-· Art. 32 (l) ·\"The right to move the 8upreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Pa.rt is guaranteed. (2) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, que warrant,o and oortiorari, which- ever may be· appropriate for the enforce- ment of any of the rights conferred by this \"Part\". Under Art. 32 (l) a citizen can approach this Court when his fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution are invaded the remedy for which is provided in cl. (2) of Art. 32. Thus the remedy under Art. 32 is not available unless the fundamental rights of a. citizen a.re invaded. In my opinion the contention raised by t.he respondents is well founded. If the statute a.nd it. constitutionality is not challenged then every pa.r. i s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 851 of it is constitutionally valid including the provi- sions authorising the levying of a tax and the mode and procedure for assessment and appeals etc. A determination of a question by a Sales tax Officer acting within his jurisdiction must be equally valid and legal. In such a case an erroneous construction, assuming it is erroneous, is in respect of a. matter which the statute has given the authority complete jurisdiction to decide. 'fhe decision is therefore a valid act irrespective o!.its being erroneous. An order of assessment passed by a quasi- judicial tribunal under a statute which is 11,ltra vires cannot be equated with an assessment order passed by that tribunal under an intra vires stat- ute even though erroneous, The former being with out authority of law, is wholly unauthorised and has no existence in law and therefore the order is an infringement• of fundamental rights under Art. 19( l) (f) & (g) and can be challenged under Art. 32. The latter is not unconstitutional and has the protection of law being under the authority of a valid law and therefore it does not infringe any fundamental right and cannot be impugned under Art. 32. To say that the doing of a legal act violates a fundamental right would be a con- tradiction in terms. It may be pointed out that by an erroneous decision of the quasi-judicial authority the wronged party is not left without a remedy. In the first place under the Act before an assessment is ma.de the Sales tax Officer is re- quired to 'give notice and hear objections of a tax- payer and give decision after proceeding in a judi- ci..a.l manner that is after considering the objections, aud such evidenoe as is led. Against the order of assessment an appeal is provided by s. 9 of the Act and against such an appellate order a revision can be ta.ken under s. 10 of the Act under a. 11 a reference to the High Court on a question of law 19611 Sml. Ujjam Bt1.1 v. Shte of Uttar Pradewh KapurJ. 1982 Smt. Ujjam Bai v. S141e of Utlar Pradesh Ka;'tJr J. 852 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963) is provided and if the revising authority refuses to make a reference then the High Court can be moved to direct the revising authority to state a case and t.hen an appeal would lie under Art. 136 of the Constitution of India and it may be added that a pritition under Art. 226 would lie to the High Court in appropriate cases against which an appeal will lie to this Court under Art. J 36. It may here ba added that the prncedure prescrib- ed by the Act shows that the Sales tax Officer has to determine the turnover after giving the tax- payer a reason hie opportunity of being heard and such an assessment is a quasi-judicial act Province of Bombay v. Kusaldas S., Advani (1). If a Sales tax Officer acts as a qutU!i-judicial authority then the decision, whether right or wrong, is a perfectly valid act which has the au thm:ity of an intra vires statute behind it. Such a decision, in my opinion, does not infringe any fundam11ntal right of the peti- tioner and any challenge to it• under Art. 32 is unsustainable. Before giving the reasons for any opinion I think it necessary to refer to the constitutional provisions dealing with the power to tax. This subject is dealt with in Part XII of Constitution and Art. 265 therein which is the governing pro- vision provides :- \"No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.\" Therefore a taxing law enacted by a legislature, which it is not competent to enact, will have no existence in the eye of law and will be violative of Art. 19 (l)(g). The same result will follow if f;he law is a colourable piece of legislation e.g., a law disguised as a tl\\xing law but. really law but confiscatory measure the object of which i• not to raise revenue but confiscation. Similarly, if a tax is assessed by an authority which has no jurisdict. (I) [19SOJ I s.c.R. 621, 725. I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 853 tion to impose it will also be outside the protection of law being without authority of law. The same will be the case· where an Executive authority levies a.n unauthorised tax. Then there are cases like the present one where a quasi-judicial tribunal imposes a .tax by interpreting a notification under a taxing provision and the objection ta.ken is that the interpretation is erroneous. The cases relied upon by counsel for the appellant a;nd the respond- ent fall within one or other of these categories. A.s I have said above, the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor _ General is well founded. It has the support of the following decisions of this Court which I shall now deal with. In GUlahdas v. Assistant Collector of Oustom (1) it was held that if the order impungned is made under the -provi- sions of a. statue which is intra vires and the order is within the jurisdiction of the authority making it then whether it is right or wrong, there is no infraction of the fundamental rights and it has to be challenged in the manner provided in the Statute and not by a petition undnr Art. 32. In that case the petitioner was aggrieved by the order of the Asc:iistant Collector of Customs who assessed the goods imo0rted undJr a licence under~ differ- ent entry and consequently a higher Excise Duty was imposed. The petitioners feeling aggrieved bv the order filed a petition under Art. 32 and the objection to its maintainability was that the application could not be sustained because no fundam~ntal right had been violated by the impugned order it having been properly and correctly made by the authorities competflnt to make it. The petitioner there contended that the goods imported, which were called 'Lyra.' brand Crayons werA not crayons at all and therefore imposition of a higher duty by holding them to be crayons was a.n infringement of fundamental (I) A.I.R. l9j7 S.C. 733, 736. 1962 Smt.

Delivering the judgment of the Court, S. K. Das, J., observed at p. 736 .:- \"What, after all, is the grievance of the petitioners? They do not challenge any of the provisions Of the India Traiff Act, 1934 (XXXII of 1934) or any of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 (VIII of 1878). It is for the Customs authorities to determine under the provisions of the said Acts \"It\" hat duty is payable in respect of certain imported articles. The Customs authorities ca.me to a. decision, right or wrong, and the petitionera pursued their remedy by way of an appeal to the Central Board of Revenue. The Central Board of Revenue dismiSBed the appeal. D'nless the provisions relating to the imposition of duty are challenged as unconstitutional, or the orders in question are oh&llenged as being in excess of the powers given to the Customs authorities and therefore without jurisdiction it is difficult to see how the question of any fundamental right under Art. 19(1) els. (f) & (g) of the Constitution can a.t all a.rise. If the provisions of law under which the impugned orders have been passed are good provisions and the orders ps.ssed are with jurisdiction, whet.her they be right or wrong on facts, there is really no question of the infraction of a fundamental right. If a particular decision is erroneous on facts or merits, the proper remedy is by way of an appeal. All that is really contended is that the orders are erroneous on merits. That surely does not give rise to the violation of &ny 1 S.C.R. SUPREME OOURT REPORTS 855 fundamental right under Art. 19 of the Con- stitution.\" . The second case is Bhatnagar Oo. Ltd. v. The Union of lndift (1). In that case the Sea Customs authorities ordered thA confiscation of goods on the ground th!J.t the petitioner had been trafficking in licenses under which the goods had been imported. This order was challenged under Art. 32. It was held that the order of confiscation made as a result of investigation, which ·the Customs Authorities were competent to make, was not open to challenge in proceedings under Art. 32 of the Constitution on the ground that the conclusions were not pro- perly drawn. It was observed :- ''If the petitioner's grievance is that the view taken by the appropriate authorities in this matter is erroneous that i1 not a matter which can be legitimately agitated before us in a petition under Art. 32. It may perhaps be, as the learned So1icitor General suggested, that the petitioner may have remedy by suit for damages but that is a matter with which we are not concerned. If the goods have been seized in accordance with law and they have been ~ized as a result of the findings recorded by the relevant authorities compet- ent to hold enquiry under the Sea Customs Act, it is not open to the petitioner to cont- end that we should ask the authorities to exercise discretion in favour of the petitioner and allow his licences a further lease of life. Essentially the petitioner's grievance is against the conclusions . of fact reached by the relevant authorities.\" - The third case is The Parbhani Transp<Yrt Go-operative Society Ltd. v. The Re,gional Transport Authority, Aurangabad (2) where the (I) (1957) s.c.a. 101, 112. t2) [19601 s s.c.R. in. 188. 1961. Sml. Ujjom Bai •• Sta~1 of Uttar · Prad11h EaparJ, 1962 Smt. Ujjam Bai ... S1at1 of Ui'• Prad1sh -Kapur J. 856 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] decision of a. Transport Authority in granting a motor carriage permit was challenged as a contravention of Art. 14. The Court held that the Regional Transport Authority acts in a quasi- judicial capacity in the matter of granting permits, and if it comes to an erroneous decision the decis- ion is not challengeable under Art. 32 of the Constitution because the decision right or wrong could not infringe Art. 14. Sarkar J., said at p. 188:- \"The decision of respondent No. I (Regional Transport Authorit}) may have been right or wrong ......... but we are unable to see that the decision offends Art. 14 or any other fundamental right of the petitioner. The respondent No. l was acting as a quasi- judicial body and if it has made any mistake in its decision there are appropriate remedies available to the petitioner for obtaining relief. It cannot complain of a breach of Art. 14\". Lastly reliance was placed on an unreported judgement of this Court in Aniyotk Kunkamina Umma v. The Ministry of RehabiUtatian, Government of India, New Delhi (') The petitioner in that case was a reprssen~­ ative-in-interest of her husba.nd who had been declared an evacuee by the Custodian of Evacuee property. Her appeals first to the Deputy Cust- odian and then to the Custodian General were unsuccessful. She then field a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution. It was held that J,he appropriate authorities of competent jurisdiction under the Administration of Evacuee Property Act 1950 having determined that the husband was an evacuee within that Act and the property was evacuee property it was not open to the 'petit- ioner to challenge the decision of the CustOdian (II) [1962] I s.c.R. sos. Srt 1. Ujjam Bai ... SI•,. •f UtMr P,;.USA x-,J. 858 SUPREME COURT REPORTs [1963] which this Court was approached. In support of his case the Attorney General mainly relied on KaiJaBh Nath v. St,ate of U.P.(1) and tried to buttress that decision by certain oases decided before and subs· equent to it. He submitted that a misconstruction of a provision of law even by a quasi-judicial tribu- nal is equally an infringement of fundamental rights under Art. 19( l)(f) & (g) because as a· con· sequence of such misconstruction the tax is an ilh•gal imposition. In KaiJaBhNath's case it was contended before the Sa.lea tax Authorities that cloths, on which Excise duty had already been paid and which was then processed, hand-printed and exported, no sales tax was leviable as it was exempt under the notifi· cation under s. 4 of the U. P. Sales Tax Act. The Sales tax Authorities however held the exemption ti:> be applicable only to cloth which had not been processed and hand-printed and was in the original oondition. A petition under Art. 32 was filed against that order and it was contended that the rights of the aliseSBee undE r Art.. 19( 1 )(g) were infringed by the order misinterpreting the notifica· tion. The Court said:- \"If a tax is levied without due legal authority on any tr~de or business, then it is open to the citizen aggrieved to approach this oourt for a writ under Art. 32 since his right to oarry·on trade is violated or infringed by the imposition and such being the case, Art. 19(l)(g) comes into play\". The objection there taken on behalf of the State was in the following terms:- ''That the imposition of an illegal .tax will not entitle the citizen to invoke Art. 32 but he muiit resort to remedies· available under ordi- nary law or proceed under Art. 226 of the Constitution, in view of the fact that the right (I) A.LR. 1957 S.C. 790, 1 s.c.R. SUPREltE OOURT REPORTs 859 to be exempted from the payment of ta.x can- not be said to be a fundamental right · which comes within the purview of Art. 32\". This contention was repelled because of the folio· wing observations in the Bengal, l mmunity Oo. LW,. v. 8ta'l6 of Bihar ( 1 f. \"We are unable to agree the above con- clusion. In reaching the conclusion the High Court appearH to have overlooked the fact that the main contention of the appellant oompany, as set forth in its petition, is that the Act, in so f~r as it purports to tax a non· resident dealer in respect of an inter.State sale or purchase of goods, is Ultra vires the Constitution and wholly illegal ......... '' The other oases referred to in that judgment were Mokam'TMilY asin v. Town Area Oommittee, Ja/,alabad.( 2); State of Bombay v. United Motors ('); Himmatlal Haf'ilal, Mehta v. State of Madhya Pradesh (') and Billi Supply Oo. v. Union of India (6). Thus the decision in that case was bused on decisions none of which supports the proposition that a misoonstru- tion by a quasi-judicial tribunal of a notification under the provision of a statute which is intra viru is· a violation of Art. 19( I )(g). On the other hand they were all oases where the imposition of tax ol license fee 01· executive action was sought to be sup· port6d by an tdtra vires provision of the law and was therefore void and violative of Art. 19 (l)(g). As· this distinction was not kept in view the remedy by way of petition under Art. 32 was held to be available. The question as now raised was not argued in KaUa8hNath'8 case.

In the former case the provision of law being valid the. order will be protected as being under the authority of a valid law and therefore it will not be violative of Art. 19(l)(g) and Art. 32 is not availa- ble to challenge that order. In the latter case, the provisions of .law being void the protection of law does not operate and the order is an unauthorised interference with the rights of a oitizen under Art. 19(1 )(g). It can therefore be challenged under Art. 32. This distinction does not seem to have been kept in view in Kai/,ash Natk's case (1). That case is further open to the criticism that it is based on decisions which were not cases of erroneous inter- pretations of notifications under intra vires statutes but were cases where an unconstitutional provision of law was sought to be used to support a tax. For the reasons I have given Kailash Natk's case(l) cannot be accepted as well founded\". In yet another case where the remedy under Art. 32 was sought to challenge the decision of a Sales tax Officer is Ramavtar Budhaipraaad ero. v. Asdstant Saks tax Officer, Akola ('). There a Sales tax Officer on a construction of a Schedule of the Sales tax Act had held that betel leaves were subject to sales tax as they were not vegetables which were exempt from that tax and this Court upheld that decision. The question as to the availa- bility of Art. 32 was not raised. Besides Kaikuh Nath' s case which I have dealt with above the other case relied upon by the lear- ned Attorney General fall within the following cate- gories in none of which the question as now ar.gued &rose or was considered. (I) Where the tax imposed Dr action taken is under a statute which is unconstitutional. (1) A.I.IL 1957 S.C. 790. (2) [1961] 1 S.c.R. 279. I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 861 (2) Where the Executive action is without authority of law. ( 3) Where the taxing authority imposes a. tax or acts without authority of law. (4} Where the quasi-judicia] authority without having jurisdiction determines a fa.ct or gives a decision. I shall now discuss the cases which fall in the first category i.e. where action is taken under a statute which is unconstitutional. The action ta.ken thereunder must necessarily be unconstitutional which is challengeable by an aggreived party under Art. 32. In Himmaflal Hari\"lal Mehta v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1) sales ta.x was neither levied nor demanded but apprehending that an illegal sales tax may be assessed and Jevied a petition under Art. 226 was filed in the High Court which was dis- missed and an appeal was ·brought to this Court and thus it was not a petition under Art. 32. In that case the sales tax 'Qnder explanation II to s. 2(g) of the Central Provinces & Berar Sales tax Act (Act 2 of 1947) was held ultra vires of the State Legislature because it offended Art. 286(l}(a) and its imposition or threat of imposition was held without authority of law and therefore infringement of the constitu- tional right guaranteed under Art. 19( l)(g} entitling the petitioner to apply under Art. 226 of the Constitution. This case the ref ore decided that a tax under an Act which is unconstitutional, ultra vires a.nd void is without authority of law under Art. 265 and is an infringement of Art. 19 (I) (g). This case and RamJilal's case (2) received approval in The Bt?Jn(Jal Immunity Co. case (8). In the Bt?Jn(Jal Immunity case also tho right infringed was by an Act which was ultra 'Vires (I) (1954) S.C.R. 1122. (2) (1951) S.C.R.. 127, (ll (19SS) 2 S.C.R. ~. 61& 196Z Sme. Ujjom Bai Y •.

The facts of that case were that the appellant company filed a petition under Art. 226 in the High Court of Patna for a writ of prohibition restraining the Sales tax Officer from making an assessment of sales tax pursuant to a notice issued by him. The appellant claimed that sales sought to be asst'BSed were made in the course of inter-State trade, that the provisions of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Bihar Act 19 of 1947) which authorised the imposition of tax on such sales were repugnant to Art. 286 ( 2) and void, and that, therefore. the proceedings taken by the · Sales tax Officer should be quashed. The application was dismissed by the High Court on the ground that if the Sales tax Officer made an assessment whioh was erroneous, the assessee could challenge it by way of appeal or revision under ss. 24 and 25 of the Act and that as the matter was within the jurisdic· tion of the Sales tax Officer, no writ of prohibition or certiorari could be issued. There was an appeal against this order to this Court and therein a prelimina.ry objection was taken that a writ under Art. 226 was not the appropri:ate remedy open to an assessee for challenging the legality of the proceedings before a Sales tax Officer. In rejecting this contention, this Court observed:- \"It is, however, clear from article 265 that no tax can be levied . or collected except by authority of law which must mean a good and valid law. The contention of the appellant company is that the Act which _ authorises the asseBBment, levying and collection of sales tax on- inter-State trade contravenes and constitutes an infringement of Art. 286 and i11, therefore, tiltra virea, void and unen- forceable. If, however, this contention be yell \"ded, tJie 1;81DedJ b7 wa7 of a wri& 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 863 must, on principle and authority, be available to the party aggrieved.\" And dealing with the, contention that the petitione1· should proceed by wa.y of itppeal or revision under the Act, this Court observed :- \"The answer to ~his plea. is short and simple. The remedy under the Act cannot be said to be adequate and is, indeed nugatory or useless if the Act which provides for such remedy is itself ultra vires and void and the principle relied upon can, therefore, have no application were a party comes to Court with an allega~ion that his right has been or is being threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra tJires the powers of the legislature which enacted it and as such void and prays for appropriate relief under article 226.\" (p. 620). It will be seen that the question which a.rose in that case was with reference to a provision in a taxing statute which was ultra tiires and the decision was only that action taken under such a provision was without the authority of law and was, therefore, an unconstitutional interference with th~ right 'to carry on business under Ar.t. 19\\l}(g). In Mohmmad Yasin v. The Town Area O<Ym- mittee, Jal<ilabad (1) the imposition of the license fee was without authority of law and was therefore held to be ohallengeable under Art. 32 because such a license fee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as on unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on business. In Balaji v.

Ultar hWtsh 864 SUPREMlll OOURT REPORTS (1963] The assessee attacked the constitutionality of s.\" 16(3)(a)(i)(ii) of the Income tax Act. The first question there raiserl was of the legislative compe- tence of Parliament to enact the law· and that Par- liament was h9ld competent to enact. Socondly the constitutionality of the provision was questio. ned on the ground that it violated tl1e doctrine of equality before tho law under Art. 14 of the Cons- titution and that ground was also repelled and it was held that tue legislature had selected for the purpose of classification only that group of persons who in fact are used as a cloak to perpetuate fraud on taxation. The third ground of attack was based on Art. 19(l)(f) & (g) of the Constitution. Relying upon the case of Mohd. Yasin v. Town Area Cammittee.(1) which was a case of license fees and llimmatlal Harilal .ilfrhta's case(') ·in which there was no determination by any tribunal but there was a threat of an illegal imposition, the court held that not only must a law be valid in the sense of there being legislative competence, it must also not infringe the fundamental rights declared by the Constitution. This again was not a case of a deter- mination of a question by a taxing authority acting quasi-judicially but the . const!tutionality and vires of the statute were challenged. The second category of cases is were the Taxing Authority imposes a tax or acts without authority of law and the assessment made by the Taxing Authority is without jurisdiction. Tat,a Iron & 8f£el, Co., Lf.d., v. S. R. Sarkar (') was a case under the Central 8ales Tax Act under which sales in the course of inter-State trade are liable to be taxed only once and by one State on behalf of the Central Government. The petitioner company in that case was asse88ed to tax of certain sales falling within that Act by the Central ~ales tax Officer, Bihar. and the tax wa.e paid. 'l'hey were again taxed by tlle Cll (1952; S.C.R. 572. (2) ( 1954) S.C.R. 1122. (~) (l!Hil) I S.c:.ll. S19,, a I S.C.R.

The objection to the maintainablity of the petition on tfte ground that an appeal against the order or assessment could be taken and that proceedings under Art. 32 were incompetent was overruled. Shah J., in delivering the judgment of the majority referred to the decision of this Court in Himmatlal Harilal Mehta's case, (1); r.Phe Bengal Immunity Co. case( 2) and the State of Bombay v. United Motors India LU. (3) and observed as follows:- \"In these cases, in appeal from orders passed by the High Courts in petitions under Art. 226, this C0urt held that an attempt to · levy tax under a statute which was ultra vires infringed the fundamental right of the citizen and recourse to the High Court for protection of the fundamental right was not prohibited because of the provisions contained in Art. 265. In the case before us, the vires of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, are not challeng- ed; but in Kailash Nath v. The Sta~ of Uttar Pradesh A. I . .R. 1957 S.C. 790 a peti- tion challenging the levy of a. tax was enter- tained by this Court even though the Act under the authority of which the tax was sought to be recovered was not challenged as ultra vires. It is not necessary for purposes of this case to decide whether the principle of Kailash Nath's case is inconsiste11t with the view ex- pre1:1sed by this Court in Ramjilal's case [1951] S. C. R. 127''. The learned Judges also held that the statute made it impossible to levy two ta.xes on the same ·sale a.nd only one tax being payable it could be collec- ted on behalf of the Government. of India. by one (1) (1954) S.C.R. 1122.

It having been collected once the threat to recover it again was Prima Jacie an infringement of the fundamental right of the petitioner. Sarkar J., who gave the minority judgment observed:- \"In Kail,ash Nath v. The State of U. P., A.I.R. 1947 S. C. 790, this Court held that an illegal levy of sales tax on a trader under an Act the legality of which was not challenged violates his fundamental rights under Art. 19( l )(g) and a petition under Art. 32 with respect to such violation lies. The earlier case of Ramjilal v. Income tax Officer, Mohindergarh [1951] S.C.R. 127 does not appear to have been considered. It is contended that the decision in Kailash Nath' s case requires reoon· sideration. We do not think however that the present is a fit case to go into the ques- tion whether the two oases not reconcilable and to decide the preliminary question raised· The point was taken as a late stage of prooee· dings after much costs had been incurred. The question arising on this petition is further of general importance a decision of which is desirable in the interest of all concerned. As there is at least one case supporting the com- petence of the petition, we think it fit to decide this petition on its merits on the footing that it is competent''. It cannot be said that this case is an authority which supports the contention of the petitioner. Apa.rt from the fact that Kaifash N ath's case (1) did not receive approval it was decided on the ground of the Central Sates tax being a tax, which could be collected on a sale once and by one State on behalf of the Government of India, and having been imposed and paid once could not be imposed a second time. In other wo?ds lt wa11 (ll A.Lil- 1'57 s.c. 790. l S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 867 a tax whioh was without jurisdiction and there- fore fell within Art. 12( l )(f). A similar case also relied upon by the peti· tioner is J. V. Gokal & Go. (Privat,e) Ltd. v. The .AssisfJlmt Oolle0tor of Sales Tax (Inspection) (1).. The There the petitioner had entered into contracts with the Gov~rnment of India for the supply of certain quantities of foreign sugar. When the goods were on t.he high seas the petitioner deliver· cd to the Government shipping do.cumeiits pertain- ing to the goods and received the price. On· their arrival they were taken possession of by the Government of India after paying the requisite customs duty. Fvr the assessment year 1954-55 the petitioner was asseRsed to sales tax in calcula.t- ing whioh the prioe of the sales made to the Government of India deducted. The Assistant Collecter of Sales tax issued a notice to the peti- tioner proposing to review the said assessment passed by the Sales tax Officer. Objections were filed but were rejected and it waB held by the Assistant Collector that sales tax was payable in respect of the two transactions. Against this order a petition was filed under Art. 3:~ which was supported by the Union Government. It was contended by the petitioner that the sales in question were not liable to sales tax inasmuch as they took place in the course· of. import of. goods into India. This Court held that the property in the goods passed to the Goyernment of India when the shipping documents were delivered against payment and that the sales of goods by the petitioner to the Government took place when the goods were on the high seas and were there- fore e.x:emptfrom sales tax under Art. 286 (l)(b) of the Constitution. 'l'his was also a case of lack of legislative authority and jurisdiction to im{>OSe the sales tax. i968 Smt. Ujjam Biii y, St.ti oJ Ull•r Pradt1h 190! Smt~ lTJj•rn Bai v. Sidle oj Uetar PrU.sh Kapur I 868 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963) Then there are oases where the Executive action is without authorjty of law. One such case is Bombay Dyeing Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The State of Bombay (I) which was not a peti- tion under Art. 32 but an appeal against can order under Art. 226. In that oase under the Bombay Labour Welfare Fund Act, .which authori- sed the constituting of a fund for financing labour welfare, notices were served upon the appellant company to remit the fines and unpaid ac<Jumula- tions in its custody to the Welfare Commissioner. The appellant company questioned in a petition under Art. 226 the validity of that Act as a con- travention of Art. 31(2). The High Court held that Act intra vim~ and dismissed the petition. On appeal against that judgment this Court held that the unpaid accumulations of wages and fines were the property of the Company and any dire- ction for the payment of those sums was a contra- vention of Art. 31(2) and therefore invalid. It was also held that assuming that the money was not property within the meaning of Art. 31(2 )and Art. 19( l) ( f) applied that Article would also be of no help to the Welfare Commissioner bAcause it co.uld not be supported under Art. 19 ( 5) of the Constitution. Moreover this was not a case of a determination by a quasi-judicial tribunal but was a case of executive action without authority of law. In Bidi Supply Co. v. The Union of India(') an order passed by Central Board of Revellue transferring the assessment records and proceed- ings of the petitioner from Calcutta to Ranchi under s. 5 ( 7 A) of the Inoome tax Act was challen- ged under Art. 32 as an infringement of the fundamental rights of the petitioner under Arts. 14, 19(l)(g) and 31 of the Constitution. The impugned order by the Central Board uf Revenue was made acting in its executive oapaoity and this (II (19SB) S.C.R, 1122. 12) (l9S~) S.c;:.R. 257, 271,27l, t s.c.R. SUPREME OOURT REPORTS Court, without deciding the question whether the order could be supported on the ground of reasonable clas8ification held that the order expressed in genera.I terms without· any reference to any particular case and without any limitation aa to time was not contemplated or sanctioned by sub-s. 7(A) of s. 5 and therefore the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of the provisions of sub-ss. 1 and 2 of s. 64 of . Indian Income tax Act. The question decided therefore was that the Central Board of Revenue acting under s. 5(7A) was not empowered to pass an ''omnibus wholesale order of transfer\". It was not a quasi-judicial order of an administrative tribunal acting within its juri- sdiction hut an unauthorised executive order of an administrative tribunal acting in its adminis- trative capacity. Section 5(7A) was subsequently 'a.mended and in a somewhat similar oase Pannal,· al Binjraj v. Union of India (1) it was held that the amended s. 5( 7 A) was a measure of administra- tive convenience and was constitutional and an order pa::sed thereunder was equally constitu- tional. In Thakur Amar Singhji v. State of Rajastkan(2) the State of Rajasthan passed orders assum· ing certain jagirs under Rajas than Land Reforms and H.esumption of Jagirs Act. In the case of one o( the jagirs it was held by this Court that the notification,· by which the resumption was made, was bad as regards ·properties comprised in that petition because the properties were not within the impugned Act, and being dedicated for religious 1mrposes was exempt under s. 207 of the Act. rhis again was not a case of any quasi-judicial decision but it was a notification issued by the ex- ecutive Governmeµt in regard to properties not within the Act which was challenged in that case. ....

The St,ate of Madhy(J, Prad(',{Jh ( '). The petitioners there were called upon to file their returns of the total purchase of tobacco made by them out of Madhya Pradesh with a view to assess and levy purchase tax. The return was filed under protest and the Sales tax Authorities, as it was required under the law, called upon the petitioners to deposit the purchase tax. No quasi-judicial determination was made, no decision was given after hearing the taxpayer, but deposit was asked to be made as that was a requirement of the statute. In a peti- tion under Art. 32 of the Constitution for a writ of mandamus restraining the State of Madhya Pradesh from enforcing Madhya Pradesh Act agai- nst the petitioners it was contended that the transactions were in the course of inter-State trade. The nature of the transaction was that finished to- bacco which was supplied to the petitioners by tlie suppliers moved from the State of Bombay to the State of Madhya Pradesh and the tra.nsaotions which were sought to be taxed were therefore in the course of inter-State trade and were not liable to tax by the State. That was not a case of mis- construction of any statue by any quasi- judicial authority but that was a case in which the very tra.Illlaction was outside the taxing powers of the State and any action ta.ken by the taxing authori- ties was one '~ithout authority of l~w. The statue did· not give jurisdiction to the Authority to decide an inter-State transaction was an intra-State sale. If it had so done the statute would have been on- oonstitutional under Art. 286( 1 )(a). ln Madanlal Arora v. The Excise Taxation Officer Amritsar (1), notices were issued to the asse- see enquiring him to attend with the documents and ll) [1955) 2 S. C.R. 509. (2) [1962) I S.C.R. 823. 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPOR'l\"S 871 other evidence in support of his returns. In the last of these notices it was stated that on failure to produce the documents &nd evidence the case will be decided ''on best judgment assessment basis\". The petitioner did not comply with the notices but filed a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution chellenging the right of the authority to make a \"best judgment assessment\" on the ground that at the date of the last notice the sales. tax authority had no right to proceed to make any \"best judg- ment assessment'' as the three years within which alone such assessment could be ma.de had expired. This contention was held to be well founded. In· deed the respondent conceded that he could not contend to the contrary. This therefore was a case in which the taxing authority had no jurisdiction to take proceeding for s.sseesment of tax because of the expiry of three years which had to be courited from the end of the each quarter in respect of which the return had been filed. The question was one of lack of jurisdiction and it made no difference that the Sales tax Officer had misconstrued the pro- vision. Y. Mahaboob Sheriff v. Mysare 8tat,e Tran8p(lrl Authority ( 1). was a case under the Motor Vehicles Act. The petitioners' application for the renewal of the permits were granted by the Regional Transport Authority empo'!ered to grant renewal for the period of one year. A petition under Arts.· 226 and 227 of the Constitution was filed against the order of renewal after the usual appeals had been taken and .proved unsuccessfol and the petition was summari1y dismissed. Thereafter a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution was filed in this Court and the question for determination was whether on a. proper oonstruction of the provision of s. 58 (1) (a) and (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act the period of renewal like in the oaae of original ll) C1%0l 2 s. c.

It was held that it had to be for that period as provided in snb-s. (ll (a) of s. 58 read with sub-s. 2 of that section. This, it was submitted, was an authority for the proposition that where a provision is misconstrued by an aut- hority having jurisdiction to construe a section a petition under Art. 32 is competents. In the first place the question as to whether Art. 32 was app- licable was not raised and was therefore not deci- ded. Secondly what was held was that if the authority renewed a permit the renewal had to be for a particular. period as specified in s. 58 and could not be for a lesser period. The question was therefore of jurisdiction. In Universal Imports Age:ncy v. The Okie/ Oontroller of Imports and EX'pOTts (1). the petitioners, in Pondicherry, entered before its merger with India, into firm contracts with foreign sellers and the goods agreed to be imported were shipped be- fore or after the merger. The gom;ls were confiscat- ed by the Controller of Customs on the ground that they were imported without a licence but as an option in lieu of confiscation the goods were releas1>d on payment of a fine. On a petition under Art. 32 it was held by a majority that under paragraph 6 of the French Establishments {Application of Laws) Order 1054, the transactions in question fell within the words \"things done\" il} the saving clause and were not liable to tax. This saving olause W&H contained in the Order applying Indian laws in place of the French laws. The construction was not of the taxing statute but of certain Orders by which the taxing statute had been applied to Pondi- oherry. These Orders the Taxing Officer had no power to construe and there was no law to support the order of the Collector.

Stale <'f Uttar Pra<hsh KapurJ. 874 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] contention as to the applicability of Art. 32 these were the submissions of the learned Attorney- General. A review of these cases shows that ( 1) the law which is ultra vireR either because of the legis)a. tive incompetence or its contravention of some constitutional inhibition is .a non-existing law and any action taken thereunder, quasi.judicial or otherwise, would be a contravention of Art. Ill (I) (f) and (g) and the result will be no different if it is a colourable piece of legislation; (2} where the proceedings are repugnant to the rules of natural justice the right guaranteed under Art. 19 (1) (f) and (g) are infringed; (3) the consequence is the same where assessment is made by an authority which has no jurisdiction to impose the tax nnd (4) if an administrative tribunal acting quasi-judicially misconstrues a provision which it has jurisdiction to construe and therefore imposes a tax infringe- ment of Art. 19 ( 1) (g) would result according to Kailash Nath' s case (') but there is no such infringe· ment according to cases which the learned Addi- tional ~olicitor General relied upon and which have been discussed above. The reason why the deci· sion in the latter cases is correct and the decision in Kailash Nath' s case (1) is not have already been given a.nd it is unnecessary to repeat them. Mr. Palkhivala who intervened in C. M. P. 1496/61 in support of the petition in the main argued the question whether a misconstruction of a taxing statute can involve the violation of a fund- amental right under Art. 19 ( 1) (g). His contention was that an erroneous construction which result in transgression of constitutional limits would vio - late Art. (19) (1) (!!)and that the difference between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error was immaterial and that a misconstruction of a statute can violate the right to trade and he relied upon (I) A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 7>0. I S.O.R. SUPREME OOURT REPORTS 875 M/s. Mohanlal Hargovind Das v. The State of Mad- hya Pradesh C) which was a case of inter-State sale and which has already been discussed. He also relied upon the decision in R. S. Ram Jawaya Kapur v. The State of Punjab (2 ) •. In that case it was held that the acts of the Executive even if deemed to be sanctioned by the legislature can be declared void if they infringe any of the fundamen- tal rights but no question of judicial determination by quasi-judicial tribunal arose there. Similarly in M/s. RamNarain Sons Ltd. v. Asstt. Commissioner of Sales tax (a) the question raised was of the meaning and scope of the proviso to Art. 286 \\2) and therefore the question was one of inter-State sales which no statute could authorise to tmn into intra-State sale by a judicial decision. It was argued before us that the decision of a tribunal acting quasi-judicially op~rates as res judi- cata and further that the judgment of the High Court of Allahabad when it was moved by the peti- tioner under Art. 226 of the Consjtution against the order of assessment passed on the ground of misconstruction of the notification of December 14, 1957 also opera.tos as res judicata as the appeal against that order has been withdrawn. The High Court rejected the petition under Art. 227 firstly on the ground that there was an alternative remedy of getting the error corrected by way of appeal and secondly the High Court said:- \"We have, however, heard the learned counsel for the petitioner on merits also, but we a.re not satisfied that the interpretation put upon this notification by the Sales Tax Officer contains any obvious error in it.

The object of passing the Addi- tional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Im- portance) Central Act, No. 58 of 1957 was to le1•y an additional excise duty on certain im- portant articles and with the concurrence of the State Legislature to abolish Sales tax on those articles. According to the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner during the period 14th December, 1957 to June 30, 1958, the petitioner was liable neither to pay- ment of excise duty nor to payment of sales tax. We do not know why there should have been such an exemption. The lanimage of the notificatiou might well be read as mean- ing that the notification is to apply only to those goods on which an additional Central excise duty had been levied and paid.\" It is unnece~sary to decide this questiou in this case. It was next argued that the Sales tax Authori- ties are all officers of the State charged with the function of levy and collection of taxes which is essentially administrative and that when they act as quasi-judicial tribunals that function is only inciden- tal to the discharge of their administrative function and therefore the assessment order of December 20, 1958, was an executive order and falls within Art.19(l)(g). Reference was made to BidiSupply Go., v. The Union of lndi:a (1) (at pp. 271 and 277), a case under s. 5(7-A) of the Income tax Act. At page 271 the definition of the word \"State\" is set out and at p. 277 Das, C. J., said that the \"State\" includ•s its Income tax Department. There is no dispute that the Sales tax Department is a department of the State ~nd is included within the wnrd \"State\" but the question is what is the nature and quality of the determination made by a Sa.Jes Tax Officer (I) (1956) S.C.R. 257, 271, 277. l S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 877 when he is performing judidal or quasi-judicial functions. The argument of 1 he learned Attorney General comes to this that even though in the perform1.nce of quasi-judioial functions the Taxing Officer may have many of the trappings of a court still he is not a court and therefore the decision of the taxing authority in the present case was not entitled to the protection which an erroneous decision of a proper court has; Ohaparala Krishna Brahman v. Oururu Govardhaiah (1) where it was held that the Income tax Officer is not a court within s.195 of the Criminal Procedure Code was cited in support of the contention that the taxing authority in the present case was not a court. So also Bdl Co. of Australia Ltd. v. The Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2) 1 where it was held that a Board of Revenue created by the Income tax Assessment Act to review the decision of Commissioner of Income tax is not a court exercising the judicial powers of the Commonwealth. At page 298 Lord Sankey. L. 0., observed: \"An administrative tribunal may act judi- cially, but still remain an administrative tribunal as distinguished from a Court, strictly so called. Mere externals do not make a direction to an administrative officer by an ad hoc tribunal an exercise by a court of judicial power\". It was also observed in that case that there are tribunals with many of the trappings of\"' court, which nevertheless are not courts in the strict sense exercising judicial power. There is no gain- saying that Sales tax Officer is not a court even though he may have many of the trappings of a court including the power to summon witnesses, receive evidence on oath and making judicial determinations. In the strict sense of the term he is not a oourt exercising judicial power; but the (I) A.I.R. 1:>54 Mad. 822. (2) (1931) A. C. 275, 298. 1962 Sml Ujj;m Bai v.

St•l~ of Utlar Pr a dish Kapur J. 878 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963) question for decision in the present case is not whether he is a Court or not but whether the determination made by him in regard to the exem- ption available to the petitioners on the sale of biris was a decision made by a quasi-judicial autho- rity in the exercise of its statutory powers and within its jurisdiction and therefore not an admi- nistrative act. The rharacteristic of an administrative tribu- nal is that it has no ascertainable standards. It only follows policy and expediency which being subjective consideration~ are what a tribunal makes them. An administrative tribunal acting as an administrative tribunal and acting as a. judicial tribunal may be distinguished thus: \"Ordinarily 'administrative' tribunals need not act on legal evidence at all, but only on such considerations as they see fit. A statute requiring such evidence to be received prevents a tribunal's making up its mind until it has given thio evidence a chance to weigh with it. But it is a fallacy to assume that the tribnnal is thereby limited to acting on that evidence. If it is an 'administrative' tribm~al it must still be iroverned by policy and expendiency until it has heard the evi- dence, but the evidence need not influence its policy any further than it sees fit. A con- trary view would involve the decision's being dictated by the evidence, not by policy and expediency; but if certain evidence with it a right to a particular decision, that decision would be a decision on legal rights; so the tribunal would be administering •justice' and would be exercising judicial not •administra- tive\". ((1933) L. Q. R. 424). There are decisions of thi~ court in which certain 1 S. C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 879 tribune.ls have been held judicial bodies; Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi v. Employees of the Bharat Banh LtiJ,. (') Provinoe of Bombay v. Kusaldas S. Advani ( 2 ) where Das, J., (as he then was) observed at p. 725: \"that if a statutory authority has power · to do any aot which will prejudicially a.ff ect the subject then, although there are not two parties apart from the a:uthority and the contest between the authority proposing to do the act and the subject opposing it, the final determination of the authority will yet be a quasi-judicial act provided the authority is required by the statute to a.ct judicially\". See also N agendra Nath Bora v. The Commissioner of Hills Division ch Appeals, Assam:(a). It is unnecessary again to examine in detail the provisions of the Act to determine the charac- ter of the Sales tax Officer when he takes assess- ment proceedings for they have already been referred to. They are all characteristics of judicial or quasi-judicial process and would clothe the Sales tax Officer making assessment orders with judicial or quasi-judicial' character. Indeed, because the order of asseSBment was judicial or quasi-judicial the petitioner filed in the High Court a petition for oertiorari and against. that order an appeal under Art. 136 as also a. petition for certiorari under Art. 32. Taking the nature of the determina- tion by the Sales tax Officer in the instant case it cannot be said that he is purely a.n administrative authority or the order passed by him is an execu- tive order; on the contrary when he is determining the a.mount of tax payable by a dealer, he is acting in a. quasi-judicial ca.pa.city.

In view of my deci- sion that a quasi-judicial order of the Sales tax Officer is not challengeable by proceedings under Art. 32, I do not think it necessary to decide the wider question whether the d<'finition of the word \"State\" as given in Art. 12 comprises the judiciar department of the State or not. In view of the decision as to the correctness of the decision in Kailash Nath's case (I). it is not necessary in this case to go into the conectness or otherwise of the order of the Sales tax Officl)r. The petition under Article 32 therefore fails and is dismissed. There will be no orders as to cvsts. (G. M. P.

The appeal against that order was dismissed by this Court for non-prosecution on February 20, 1961. Against that order of dismissal the assessee firm has filed an application for resto- ration on the ground that it had been advised that in view of the rule having been issued under Art. 32 of the Constitution wherein the contentions were the same as raised in the appeal against the order undor Art. 226 it was unnecessary to prosecute the appeal. It also prayed for condonation of delay in filing the application for restoration. \\I) A. I. R. (1957 J S.C, /90. 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 881 No sufficient ca.use has been made out for allowing the application for restoration. The assessee firm deliberately allowed the appeal, which was pending in this Court, to be dismissed for non. prosecution and after deliberately taking that step it cannot be allowed to get the dismissq.l set aside on the ground of wrong advice. The application for restoration is therefore dismissed with costs. SARKAR, J.-I have had the advantage of reading the judgments just delivered by my brothers Das and Kapur and I am in agreement with them. SuBBA RAO, J.-I have carefully gone through the judgment prepared by my learned brother Kapur, J. I am unable to agree. The facts have been fully stated in his judgment and it is therefore not necessary to cover the ground over again. This larger Bench has been constituted to canvass the correctness of the decision in Kailash Nath v. State of Uttar Pradesh (1). After hearing the elaborate arguments of learned counsel, I am convinced that no case has been made out to take a different view. Learned Attorney General seeks to sustain the correctness of the said decision. He broadly contends that this Court is the constitutional protector of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, that every person whose funda- mental right is infringed has a guaranteed right to approach this Court for its enforcement, and that it is not permissibe to whittle down that jurisdic- tion with the aid of doctrines evolved by courts for other purposes. He argues that in the present case an executive authority functioning under the Uttar .Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1948 (Act XV of 1948), hereinafter called the Act, made a clearly erroneous order imposing tax on exempted goods, (I) A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 790. 1962 Smt.

State of Uttdr Prade•h Subia Rao J. 882 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] namely, bidis, and that it is a clear infringement ot the fundamental right of the petitioner to carry on business in bidis. Whenever such a right is infrin· ged, the argument proceeds, by a State action- here we are only concerned with State action-it is the duty of this Court to give the appropriate relief and not to refuse to do so on any extraneous considerations. The Additional Solicitor General appearing for the State does not admit this legal position. He says that the Act is a reasonable restriction on the petitioner's right to carry on business in · bidis, that thereunder a Sales-Tax Officer has jurisdiction to decide, rightly or wrongly, whether bidis are exempted from sales-tax, and that, therefore, his order made with jurisdiction cannot possibly infringe the fundamental rights of the petitioner. Mr. Chari, who appears for the intervener, while supporting the argument of learned Solicitor General emphasizes the point that the fundamental rights enshrined in Art. 19( I l(g) of the Constitution is only against State action, that the definition of •'State\" in Art. 12 thereof excludes all authorities exerc:ising judicial power, that the sales-tax autho- rity, in making the a.ssessment in exercising judicial power, and that, therefore, no writ can be issued by this Court against the said authority. Before attempting to answer the questions raised, it is relevant and convenient to ascertain precisely the position of the fundamental right.e under the Constitution and the scope of the jurisdi- ction of this Court in enforcing those rights. Fundamental rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution as the paramount rights of the people. Article 13(2) prohibits the State from making any law which takes away 01! abridges the rights conferred by the said Part and decl,area that 1 s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 883 any law made in contravention of this clause shall. to the extent of the contravention, be void. These rights may be broadly stated to relate to ( i) right to equality-Arts. 14 to 18, (ii) right to freedom- Atts. 19 to 22, (iii} right against exploitation- Arts. 23 and 24, (iv) right to freedom of religion- Arts. 25 to 28, (v) cultural and educational rights- Arts. 29 and 30, (vi) right to property--Arts. 31 and 31A, and (vii) right to constitutional remedies- Arts. 32 to 35. The~e are the inalienable rights of the people of this country-some of them of non- citizens also-believed to be necessary for the development of human personality ; they are essential for working out one's way of life. In theory these rights are reserved to the people after the delegation of the other rights by them to the institutions of Government created by the Con- stitution, which expresses their will : see observa- tions of Patanjali Sastri, J., as he then was, in A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras(1). In State of Madras v. Shrimati Champakam Dorairajan (2) the same idea was more forcibly restated thus: ' 1The chapter of Fundamental Rights is sacrosanct and not liable to be abridged by any legislative or Executive Act or order, except to the extent provided in the approp- riate article in Part III. The directive principles of State Policy have to conform to and run as subsidiary to the Chapter of Fundamental Rights.\" In the context of fundamental rights, an important principle should be borne in mind, namely, that the English idea of legislative supremacy is foreign to our Constitution. As this Court pointed out in A. K. Gopalan's case (l) the Constitution has not accepted the English doctrine of absolute supremacy of Parliament in matters of legislation, Therefore, every institution, be it the (1) (19~0) S.C.R. 88.

Stat• of Utrar Pr.(l,sh Subba R1Jo J. 884 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963) Executive, the Legislature of the Judiciary, can only function in exercise of the powers conferred on it that is, the Constitution is the paramount law. As the Constitution declares the fundamental rights and also prescribes the restrictions that oan be imposed thereon, no institution can overstep the limits, directly or indirectly, by encroaching upon the said rights. But a mere declaration of the fundamental rights would not be enough, and it was necessary to evolve a machinery to enforce them. 80 our Constitution, entrusted the duty of enforcing them to the Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in the country. This Court has no more important function than to preserve the inviolable fundament- al rights of the people ; for, the fathers of the Constitution, in their fullest confidence, have en- trusted them to the care of this Court and given to it all the institutional conditions necessary to exercise its jurisdiction in that regard without fear or favour. The task is delicate and sometimes difficult ; but this Court has to discharge it to the best of its ability and not to abdicate it on the fallacious ground of inability or inconvenience. It must be borne in mind that our Constitution in effect promises to usher in a welfare State for our country ; and in such a state the Legislature has necessarily to create innumerable administrative tribunals, and entrust them with multifarious functions. They will have powers to interfere with every aspect of human activity. If their existence is necessary for the progress of our country, the abuse of power by them may bring about an authoritarian or totalitarian state. The existence of the aforesaid power in this Court and the exercise of the same effectively when the oroaRion arises is a necessary safeguard against the abuse of tho power by the administrative trilmnal~. Tho scope of the power of this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution has l.icen expounded by I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 885 this Court on many occasions. The decisions not only laid down the amplitude of the power but also the mode of exercising that power to meet the different situationg that might present them~elves to this C)urt. In Ramesh Thappar v. State of-MadraB (1) this Court declared that under the Constitution the Supreme Court constituted as the protector guarantor of fundamental rights, and it cannot, consistently with the responsibility so laid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seeking protection against infringement of such rights, although such applications are made to the Court in the first instance without resort. to a High Court having concurrent jurisdiction in the matter. This Court again in Rashi,d Ahmad v. The Municipal Board, T(airana (2 ) pointed out that the powers given to this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution are much wider and are not confined to issuing prerogative writs only. This Court further elucida. ted the scope of the jurisdiction in T. C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa (3), wherein Mukberjea, J., speaking for the Court defined the scope of the power thus: \"In view of the express provisions in our Constitution we need not now look back to the early history or the procedural technicali- ties of these writs in English law, nor feel op- pressed by any difference or change of opinion expressAd in particular cases by English Judges.\" Thi.\" Court again elaborated the scope of its power under that Article in Kavalappara Kottarathil Koch1tn1u: Moopil Nayar v. The State of Madras, 4 ). Das, C. J., after reviewing the earlier case law on the subject observed: \"Further, even if the existence of other a~lequate Jegal remedy may be taken into oon- s1deration by the High Court in deciding (I) (1950) S.C.R. 59~.

Stat1 of U1tar P1ad1sh Suota Rao J. 886 SUPREME OOURT REPORTS [1963] whether it should issue any of th& prerogative writs on an application under Art. 226 of the Constitution, as to which we say nothing now-this Court cannot, on a similar ground, decline to entertain a petition under Art. 32, for the right to move this Court by appropri- ate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitu- tion is itself a guaranteed right.\" In that case it was pressed upon this Court to hold that in exercise of its power under Art. 32 of the Constitution, this Court could not embark upon an enquiry into disputed questions of fact, and various inconveniences were pointed out if it was otherwise. After conaidering the cases cited in support of that contention, this Court came to the conclusion that it would fail in its duty as the custodian and pro- tector of fundamental rights if it was to decline to entertain a petition under Art. 32 simply because it involved the determination of disputed questions of fact. When it was pointed out that if that view was adopted, it might not be possible for this Court to decide questions of fact on affidavits, the learned Chief Justice observed: \"As we have already said, it is possible very often to decide questions of fact on affi. davits. If the petitions and the affidavites in support thereof are not convincing and the court is not aatisfied that the petitioner has established his fundamental right or any breach thereof, the court may dismiBB the petition on the ground that the petitioner has not discharged the onus that. lay on him. The court may, in some appropriate cases, be incli· ned to give an opportunity to the parties to establish their respective cases by filing fur- ther affidavits or by issuing a commission or even by ~etting the application down for trial 1 S. C. R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 887 on evidence, as has often been done on the origina.1 sides of the High Courts of Bombay and Calcutta, or by adopting some other ap- propriate procedure. Such occasions will be rare indeed and such rare cases should not, in our opinion, be regarded as a cogent reason for refusing to entertain the petition under Art. 32 on the ground that it involves dispu- ted questions of fact.'' Finally,· this Court also held that in appropriate oases it had the power, in its discretion, to frame writs or orders suitable to the exigencies created by enactments and that where the occasion so required to make ev~n a declaratory order with consequen- tial relief. In ·short, this decision recognized the comprehensive jurisdiction of this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitutio 1 and gave it full effect without putting any artificial limitations t.hereon. But in Daryao v. State of U. P. (1). this Court app- lied the doctrine of res judicata and held that the petitioners in that case had no fundamental right, as their right on merits was denied by the High Court in a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitu- tion and that as no appeal was filed therefrom, it has become final. But the learned Judges carefully circumscribed the limits of the doctrine in its appli- cation to a petition under Art. 32. Gajendtagadkar,J., speaking for the Court observed: ''If the petition filed in the High Court under A rt. 226 is dismissed not on the merits but be- causei of the laches of the party applying for the writ or because it is held that the party had an alternative remedy available to it, then the dismissal of the writ petition would not con- stitute a bar to a subsequent p~titfon under Art. 32 except in cases where and if the facts thus found by the High Court may themselves be relevant even under Art. 3·~. If a writ {1) (1962) 1 S,C.R. 574. 1962 Smt. Ujj\"m B.ri II• State of Utt4r P1ad1~h Subba Ra1 J. 1952 Sml.

If the order is on the merits it would be a bar; if the order shows that the dismissal was for the reason that the petitioner was guilty of !aches or that he had an alternative remedy it would not be a bar, except in cases which we have already ir.dicated. If the petition is dismissed in limine without passing a speaking order then such dismissed cannot be treated as creating a bar of res judiwta. It is true that, prima facie, dismissal in limine even without passing a speaking order in that behalf may strongly suggest that the Court took the view that there was no substance in the petition at all; but in the absence of a speaking order it would not be easy to decide what factors weighed in the mind of the Court and th:\\t makes it difficult and unsafe to hold that such a summary dismissal is a dismissal on merits and as such constitutes a bar of res judicaUJ against a similar petition filed under Art. 32. If the petition is dismissed as withdrawn it cannot be a bar to a subsequent petition under Art. 32, because in such a case there has been no decision on the merits by the Con rt.\" Though this decision applies the doctrine of res judicata, the aforesaid observations indicate the anxiety of the Court to confine it wit.bin the speci- fied limits and to prevent nny attempt to overstep the said limits. Shortly stated it is settled law that Art. 32 confers a wide jurisdiction on this Court to enforce the fundamental rights, that the right to enforce a fundamental right is itself a fundamental right, and that it is the duty of this Court to enter- tain an application and tr:i decide it on merits when- ever a party approaches it to decide whether he has 1 s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 889 a fundamental right or if so whether it has been infringed irrespective of the fact whether the ques- tion raised involves a question of law or depends upon questions of fact. The doctrine of res judicata applied by this Court does not detract from the amplitude of the jurisdiction, but only negatives the right of a petitioner on the gr0und that a com- petent court has given a final decisiou against him in respect of the right claimed. In this case a further attempt is made on be· half of the State to rnstrict the scope of the Court's jurisdiction. Uninfluenced by judicial decisions, let us approach the question on principle. An illustration arii::ing on the fact;s of the present case will highlight the point to be decided. A citizen of India is doing business in bidis. He has a fund- amental right to carry on that business. The State Legislature enacts the Sales Tax Act imposing a tax on the turnover and on the sales of various goods, but gives certain exemptions. It expressly declares that no tax-shall be levied on the exempted goods. The said law is a reasonable restriction on the petitioner's fundamental right to carry on the business in bidis. Now on a true construction of the relevant provisions of the Act, no tax is leviable on bidis. But on a wrong construction of the relevant provisions of the Act, the Sales-tax Officer imposes a tax on the turnover of the petitioner relating to the said bidis. He files successive statutory appeals to the hierarchy of tribunals but without sucess. The result is that he is asked to pay tax in respect of the business of bidies exempted under the Act. The imppsition of the said illegal tax on the turn- over of bidfs is certainly an infringement of his fund- amental right. He comes to this Court and prays that his fundamental right may be enforced against the Sales-tax Officer. The Officer says, ''It may be true that my order is wrong; it may also be that the Supreme Court may hold that my construction lH!I Smt. Ujjam Bai v. Sue ~1 Uit~r Prwsia SuUa Ra~ J. --• IHI Swu. lJJjam Boi .. SI-'< •f uu., ,.,...,k s•u.\" .. \"· 890 SUPREME COURT REl>ORTS [1963] of the section as accepted by the highest tribunal is perverse; still, as under the Act I have got the power to decide rightly or wrongly, my order though illegal operates as a reasonable restriction on the petitioner's fundamental right to carry on business.\" This argument, in my view, if accepted, would in effect make the wrong order of the Sales-tax Officer binding on the Supreme Court, or to state it differently, a fundamental right can be defeated by a wrong order of an execu- tive officer, and this Court would become a help· less spectator abdicating its functions in favour of the subordinate officer in the Sales-tax Depart· ment. The Constitution says in effect that neither the Parliament nor the Executive ran infringe the fundamental rights of the citizens, and if they do, the person affected has a guaranteed right to app- roach this Court, and this Court has a duty to enforce it; but the Executive authority says, \"I have a right to decide wrongly and, there· fore the Supreme Court cannot enforce the fundamental right\". There is nothing in the Consti- tution which permits such an extraordinary position. It cannot be a correct interpreta- tion of the provisions of the Constitution if it enables any authority to subvert the paramount power conferred on the Supreme Court. It is conceded that if the law is invalid, or if the officer acts with inherent want of jurisdiction, the petitioner's fundamental right can be enforced. It is said that if a valid law confers jurisdiction on the officer to decide rightly or wrongly, the peti- tioner ha.a no fundamental right. What is the ha.sis for this principle ? None is discernible in the pro- visions of the Constitution. There is no provision which enables the Legislature to make an order of an executive authority final so as to deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction under Art, 32 of the Constitution. 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPOR'rS 891 But the finality of the order is sought to be sustained on the principle of re,s judicata. It is argued that the Sales-tax Tribunals a.re judicial tribunals in the sence they a.re courts, and, therefore their final decisions would operate as res judicata on the principle enunciated 1:>y this Court in Daryao's case (1). Can it be said tha.t Sales-tax authorities under the Act are judicial tribunals in the sense they are courts? In a Welfare Sta.te the Govern- ments is called upon to discharge multifarious duties affecting every aspect of human activity. This extension of the governmental activity necessitated the entrusting of many executive authorities with power to -Oecide rights of parties. They are really in- strumentalities of the executive designed to function in the discharge of their duties adopting, a.s far as poBBible, the principles of judicial procedure. Nonetheless, they are onl.v executive bodies. They may have the trappings of a court, but the officers manning the same have neither the training nor the institutional conditions of a judicial officer. Every Act designed to further the social and economic pro- gress of our country or to raise taxes, constituted some tribunal for deciding disputes arising there- under, such as income-tax authorities, Sale-tax authorities, town planning authorities, regional transport authorities, etc. A scrutiny of the provisi- ons of the U. P. Sales-tax Act with which we are now concerned, shows that the authorities consti- tuted thereunder a.re only such administrative tribunals as mentioned above. The preamble to the Act shows that it was enacted to provide for the levy of tax on the sa.le of goods in Uttar- Pradesh. The Act imposes a tax on the turnover of sa.les of certain commodities and provides a machinery for the levy, assessment and collection of the said tax. Under the Act the State Govern- ment is authorized to appoint 1Jertain assessing authorities. It provides for an appeal against the order of the assessing authority and for a revision in (1) (1912) 1 s.c.a. 57t. S111t. Ujj•\"' :A•i v.

The State Government is also authorized to appoint a hierarchy of authoriti<'s or trilmnals for deciding the appeals or revisions. The ll..>oessing authorities are admittedly the officers of the Sales-tax Depart- ment and there is nothing in the Aot to indicate that either the assessing authority or the appellate authority need possess any legal qualification. It is true that legal qu11.lification is prescribed for the revising authority, but that does not make him a. court or make the inferior tribunals courts. The said authorities have to follow certain principles of natural justice, but that doPs not make them courts. The scheme of the Act clearly shows that the sale- ta.x authorities appointed under the Act, following the principles of natural justice, ascertain the turn- over of an assessee and impose the tax. The hierarchy of tribunals are intended to safeguard the interest of the assessees as well as the State by cor- recting wrong orders. The fact that, following the analogy of the Income-tax Act, at the instance of the party aggrieved a. reference can be made by the reviewing authority to the High Court on a ques- tion of law shows only that the help of the High Court can be requisitioned only to elucidate ques- tions of law, but the High Court has no power to make final orders, but on receipt of the judgments of the High Court, the revising authority shall make an order in conformity with such judgment. Now let us consider the decisions cited at the :Bar which would throw some light on the nature of such tribunals. In considering whether the Board of review created by s. 41 of the Federal Inoome- Tax Assessment Act, 1922-25 w1is a judicial autho- rity, the Judicial Committee in Shell Company of Australia Limited v. Federal Commission of Taxa- tion(') observed. \"The authorities are clear to show that there are tribunals with many of the trappings ll) (1930) A. C. 275, 296, 298. 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 893 of a Court which, nevertheless, are not Courts in the strict sense of exercising judicial power.\" The Judicial Committee further observed: \"An administrative tribunal may act judicially, but still remain an administrative tribunal as distinguished from a Court, strictly so-called. Mere externals do not make a direction to an administrative officer by and ad hoc tribunal an exercise by a Court of judicial power.\" The Allahabad High Court in Messrs Kamlapat Moti Lal v. Commissioner of Income Tax, U. P. (1 ) held that the Incoma-tax authorities are not courts and, thl)reforn, their decisions cannot operat,e as res judicata. Malik, C. J., observed: \"The income-tax authorities rannot be treated as Courts deciding a disputed poi11t, except for the purposes mentioned ins. 37, and further there is no other party before them and there are no pleadings. As haEI been said by Lord Herschell in Boulter v. Kent Justices (2 ),'' \"There is no truth, no lis, no controversy inter partes, and no decision in favour of one of them aad against the other, unless, indeed, the entire public are regarded as the other party''. The Income-tax authorities are mainly concer- ned with finding out the assessable income for the year and not with deciding any question of title. But to arrive at that income they have at times to decide certain general ques- tions which might affect the determination of the assessable income not only in the year in question but also in subsequent years ...•••...

Gornrdhanaiah ( 1), where Balakrishaa Ayyar, J., after ·considering the case Jaw on the subject and the provisions of the Income-tax Act, held that an income-tax officer was not a \"court\". The learned Judge did not think that the sdoptation of norms of judicial procedure or the fact that appeals were provided for, was sufficient to make them courts. The learned Judge obeerved: \"When exercising his powers under Chap- ter IV of the Act, it seems to me, that the Income-tax Officer is acting in a purely admini- strative capacity. It is his duty to ascertain what the income of the particular individual is and what amount of tax he ehould be requi- red to pay. There is therefore no '!is' what- ever before him.\" The same reasoning would equally apply to sales· tax authorities. This Court in Bidi Supply Go. v. The Union of lndia(1), speaking through Das, C.J., set aside the order of an Income-tax Officer and in doing so observed : \"Here, 'the State' which includes its Income-tax Department has by an illegal order denied to the petitioner, as compared with other Bidi merchants who are similarly situate, equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws and the petitioner can legitimately complain of an infraction of his fundamental right under article 14 of th4' Constitution.\" \\1) ,\\.Lll. l!IM Med. 822. &a~. 1 S. C. R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 895 Though this cannot be called a direct decision on the question raised in the present case, it indi- cates that this Court treated the Income-tax Officer as a department of the executive branch of the Government. This Court again in GUllapalli Nageswara Rao v. S'tate of Andhra Pradesh (1) pointed out the distinction between a quasi-judi- cial act of an Executive authority and the judicial aot of a court thus: \"The concept of a quasi-judicial act implies that the act is not wholly judicial; it describes only a duty cast on the execu- tive body or authority to conform to norms of judicial procedure in performing some acts in exercise of its executive powers.\" It is, therefore, clear that administrative tribunal cannot be equated with courts. They are designed to discharge functions in the exercise or the execu- tive power of the State, and the mere fact that the relevant statutes, with a view of safeguard the interest of the people, direct them to dispose of matters commin!t before them following the prin- ciples of natural justice and by adopting the same well-known trappings of judicial procedure, does not make them any the less the executive orgna.s of the State. It is not possible to apply the prin- ciple of res judicata to the orders of such tribunals, for obviously s. l l of the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply to such orders, and the genera.I pri- ciple of res judicat,a de'hors tha,t provision has never been applied to such orders. It is true that some statutes expressly or by necessary implication oust the jurisdiction of Civil Courts in respect of certain matters but such exclusion can- not affect the extraordinary powers or superior courts conferred under Arts. 226, 227 and 32 of the Constitution.

In the present case the Sales.tax autho- rities deoided thn ca.so against the petitioners . The jJetitioners are seeking tho help of this Court under Art.32 of the Constitution to enforce their fundamental rights on the ground that he said orde;: infringes their rights. To put it differently, the petitioners by this application question the orders of the Sales-tax authority. How is it possi- ble to contend that the order which is now sought to be quashed can operate as res-judicata preclud- ing this Court from questionin_g its correctness ? The prinoiple underlying the doctrine of res judicata is that no one shall be vexed twice on the same matter. This implies that there should be two proceedings,and that in a former proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction, an issue has been finally decided inter partes and therefore the same cannot be reagitated in a subsequent proceeding. On the said principle the impugned order itself cannot obviously be relied upon to sustain the plea cf res-judicata. The argument ab-inronvenienti d0es not appeal to me. As it is the duty of this Oourt to enforce a fundamental right of a party if any authority has infringed his right, considerations based upon inconvenience are of no relevance. It is sugges- ted that if the jurisdiction of this Court is not restricted in the manner indicated, this Court will be flooded with innumerable petitions. A part from the fact that this is not a relevant circum- stance, a liberal interpretation of Art. 32 has not had that effect during the ten year8 of this Court's existence, and I do not see any justification for such an a.pprehension in the future. It is further said that if a wider interpn.tation is given namely, that if this Court has to aacertain in each ease whether a statutory authority has infringed a. l S.C.B .. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 897 fnnda.mental right or not, it wiil have to decide complicated questions of fa.ct involving ora.l and documentary evidence, and the machinery provi- ded under Art. :i2 of the Constitution is not adequ- ate to discharge that duty satisfactory. This again is an attempt to cloud the issue. If the jurisdiction is there and there are difficulties in the way, this Court will have to evolve by convention or other- wise some procedure to avoid the difficulties. A similar argument of inconvenience was raised in Kavalappara Kottarathil Kockuani Moopil Nayar v. Stat,e of Madras (1 )'and was negatived by this Court. This Court evolved a procedure to meet some of the difficult situa.tions that might arise in particular oases. That apart, this Court also may evolve or mould further rules of practice to suit different conting- encies. If a party comes to this Court for enforce- m~n t of a fundamental right the existence where- of depends upon proof of facts and the said party has not enhausted the remedies available to him by going through the hierarchy of tribunal created by a particular Act, this Court, if the party agrees, may a.How him to withdraw the petition with liberty to file it at a. later stage, or, if the party does not agree, may adjourn it Si'ne die till after the remedies are exhausted. If, on the other hand the party comes here after exhausting bis remedies and after the tribunals have given their findings of fact, this Court may ordinarily accept the find.- ings of fact as ic. does in appeals under Art. 136 of the Constitution. If the party complains that the order made a~ainst him by a tribunal is based upon a wrong construction of the provisions of a statute, this Court may ascertain whether on a correct interpretation of the statute, the peti- tioner's fundamental right has been violated. There ma.y be many other situations, but I have no doubt (1) [19591 Supp. (2) S.C.R. 316. 325, 337. 1962 Sml. Ujjam Bai \"· Stat• 1/ Utt°' p,.adish Sul>ba RllO J, 1911 Smt. Ujjam Boi •• St\"\" •! UUar h.U•h 898 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1~63) that this Court will deal with them as and when they arise. I would, therefore, unhesitatingly reject the argument based on inconvenience . I shall now proceed to deal with the main argument advanced by learned counsel for the respondent. Briefly stated, the argument is that the Sales-tax Officer has jurisdiction to construe rightly or wrongly the provisions of the Act, whioh is a valid Jaw, and that even if the so.id authority wrongly corastructed .a provision of the Act and imposed the tax, though on a right cons- truction of the said provision it cannot be so im- posed, the said order does not infringe the funda- mental right of the petitioner. With respect, if I may say so, this argument equates the guaranteed right of a citizen under Art. 32 of the Constitution with that of the prerogative writs obtaining in England, such as writs of certiorari, prohibition and manadamus, issued against orders of inferior tribunals or authorities. This also confuses the fundamental right enshrined in Art. 32 of the Constitution with one or more of the procedural forms this Court may adopt to suit each occasion. Th\" approach to the two question is different. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Art. 32 is couched in comprehensive phraseology and, as pointed out earlier, is of the widest amplitude: it is not confined to the issue of prerogative writs, for the Supreme Court ha.s power to issue directions or orders to enforce the fundamental right; even in respect of issuing the said writs, this Court is not oppressed by the procedural technicalities of the prerogative writs in England. While under Art. 32 this Court may, for thA purpose of enforcing a fundamental right, issue a writ of 1xrtiorari, prohibition or mandamus, in a suitable case, it may give the relief even in a case not reached by the said writs. The limitations imposed on the prero~ative wrjts cannot , i S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 899 limit the power of the Supreme Court undPr Art. 32 ·of the Constitution. In order a writ of certiorari may lie against a tribunal, the said tribunal must have acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction conferred upon it by law or there must be somo error of law apparent nn the face of the record. There are similar limitations in the case of writs of prohibition and mandamus. In the context of the issue of the said writs, courts were called upon to define what -''jurisdiction\" means. ,Turis<liction may be territorial, pecuniary, or per- sona.I. There may be inherent want of jurisdiction or irregular exercise of jurisdiction. A tribunal may have power to decide collateral facts for the purpose of assuming jurisdiction; or it may have exclusive jurisdiction to decide even the said facts. In Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd edn., Vol. III, the scope of the power of mandamus, prohibition and ~rtiorari is stated thus at p. 59 : \"The primary function of the three orders is to prevent any excess of jurisdiction (pro- hibition and certiorari; or to ensure the exercise of jurisdiction (mandamus). The jurisrliction of inferior tribunals may depend upon the fulfilment of some condition prece- dent (such as notice) or upon the existence of some particular fa.ct. Such a fact is collateral to the actual matter which the inferior tribunal has to try, and the determination whether it exists or not is logically and tempo- ralJy prior to the determination of the actual question which the inferior tribunal has to try. The inferior tribunal must itself decide as to the collateral fact: when, at the inception of an inquiry by a tribunal of limited jurisdiction a challenge is made to its jurisdiction, the tribunal has to make up its mind whether it will act or not, and for that purpose to arrive a.t some decision on whether it has jurisdictjoJJ or not.'' · 196t Smt. Ujjam Bai v. Sfale of Ute.,. PrrJd.sh Subba Rao J. 196• Smt. UJi•m B•i v. Slllt. of Uttar l'rrMUsh Subba Rao J. 900 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] \"There may be tribunals which, by virtue of legislation constituting them, have the power to determine finally the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends; but, subject to that, an inferior tribunal cannot, by a wrong decision with regard to a collateral fa.ct, give itself a jurisdiction which it would not otherwise possess or deprive itself of a jurisdiction which it otherwise would possess\". It is clear from this passage that a tribunal may have to decide collateral facts to exercise its jurisdic- tion, but unless the relevant statute confers an exclusive jurisdiction on that tribunal, it cannot wrongly clutch at jurisdiction which it has not or refuse to exercise jurisdiction which it possesses. The doctrine of jurisdiction with its limitations may be relevant in the matter of issue of prerogative writs to quash the orders of tribunals made without or in excess of jurisdiction, but the said restrictions cannot limit the power of the Supreme Court in enforcing the fundamental rights, for under Art. 32 of the Constitution for enforcing the said rights it has power to issue directions or orders uncontrol by any such limitations. That apart, even within the narrow confines of the doctrine of jurisdiction, it is wrong to confine the jurisdiction to inherent want of jurisdiction. A person, who has within the narrow confines of the doctrine of no authority to function under an Act, if he purports to act under that Act, his order will be no doubt without jurisdiction. If an authority by a wrong construction of a section purports to exercise jurisdiction under an Act which it does not possess at all, it may again be described as inherent want of jurisdfotion. But there may be many cases on the border line between inherent want of jurisdiction and exercise of undoubted juriEdictiC>n. 'Ihe authority may have jurisdiction, to decide ceftain disputes under an Aot, ~t bJ a 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 901 wrong construction of the provisions of the Act, it may make an order affecting a particular subject- matter, which, on a correct interpretation, it cannot reach. By a slight modification of the facts a.rising in the present case, the point may illustrated thus : A provision of the Sales-tax Act says that the sale of bidis is not taxable; the statute prohibits taxation of bidis; but the Sales·tax Officer on a wrong oon· struotion of the provision holds that hand-made l>idis are taxable; on a correct interpretation, the Act does not confer any power on the Sales·tax Officer to tax such bidis. In such a ease on a wrong interpretation of the provisions of the Act, he has exercised jurisdiction in respect of a subject-matter, which, on their correct interpretation, he- does not possess. In a sense he acts without jurisdiction in taxing goods whioh are not taxable under the Act. The criterion of jurisdiction must also fail in a case where an aggrieved party approaches this Court before the Sales-tax authority makes its order. A Sales-tax authority may issue only a notice threatening to ta.ke action under the Act : at that point of time, there is no decision by the tribu- nal. The person to whom notice is given approaches this Court and complains that the authority under the colour of tb.e Act proposes to infringe his fundamental right; in that case, if this Court is satisfied that his fundamental right is infringed, it ha.a a duty to enforce it. But it is said that when the Sales-tax Act provides a machinery for getting the validity of his ola.im tested by the tribunals, he must only resort to that machinery. This argu- ment may be relevant to the question whether a. civil courts jurisdiction is ousted in view of the special machinery created by a statutf>, but that circumstance cannot have any bearing on the ques- tion of enforcement of fundamental rights, for no law can exclude the jurisdiction of this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution. Nor is the 196t S111e. Ujjam Bai \"· Slal1 of UUar Pradlsh Subba Ra~ J. 1111 Smt. Ujjsn M•i v. S1at1 •I UllM Prad,sl Smk 11 .. J. 902 SUPREME OOURT REPORTS t1963] argument that if a citizen comes to this Court when the proceeding before the Sales.tax authorities is in the midstream, this Court will be permitting a citizen to short-circuit the rest of the procedure laid down by the Act, has any relevance to the question of its jurisdiction under Art. 32. This may be an argument of inconvenience and this Court, as has already been indicated, may adjourn the case till the entire proceedings come to an end before the highest Sales-tax authority. This argument of inconvenience cannot obviously a.rise when a party approaches this Court after availing himself of all the remedies available to him under the Act. I would, therefore, hold that the principles evolved by the courts in England and accept by the courts in India governing the iSBue of prero- gative writs cannot circumscribe the unlimited power of the Supreme Court to iSBue orders and directions for the enforcement of the fundamental rights. Even otherwise, in cases similar to those covered by the illustration Supra, a prerogative writ can be iSBued for quashing the order of an inferior tribunal, and a fortiori an order can be issued for enforcing a fundamental right under Art. 32 of the Constitution. Even if the said legal position be wrong, the present oa.se falls within the limited scope of the principle governing the issue of a writ of cer- tiorari. In Hari Vishnu Kamatk v. Syed Almuul Jshaque(1), the scope of that power vis-a-vis an error of law has been stated thus: \"It may therefore be ta.ken as settled that a writ of certiorari could be issued to correct an error of law. But it is essential that it should be something more than a mere error; it must be one which must be manifest on the fa.oe of the record. The real diffi. oult:y with reference to this ma\"6r, however, (l) [Jll55] l 8,0.ll; U06, 1129. :mt. Ujjam Bai ..

In the present case, the recitals in the notification clearly disclose that there is an error of law on the face of the order of the tribunals. If that error is corrected, as we should do, the position is that the Sales-tax tribunals imposed a tax on the sales transactions of biris which they had no power to do. In that event, there is a clear infringement of the funda- mental rights of the petitioners to carry on busi- ness in biris. Now let us look at the decisions of this Court to ascertain whether all or any of them have applied the criterion of jurisdiction in the matter of enforcement of fundamental right of a citizen. Where under s. 11 of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1947, the Controller was given jurisdiction to determine whether there was non-payment of rent or not, as well as the juridiction, on finding that there was non-payment of rent, to order eviction of a tenant, it was held by this Court in Rai Brij Raj Krishan v. S. K. Shaw and Brolkrs (1) that even if the Controller had wrongly decided the question whe- ther there had hr.en non·payment of rent, his order for eviction on the ground that the.~e had been non-payment of rent could not be questioned in a civil court. This decision has nothing to do with the scope of this Court's power to enforce a fundament- al right, but it deals only with the question of the ouster of the civil court's jurisdiction when a special tribunal is created to finally decide specific matters. In Messrs. Mohanl,al Hargovind Das Biri Mercha.nts Jabalpur v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (') when the Sale-tax authorities of Madhya Pradesh on & wrong view of the transactions carried on by (I) [i951] S.c.R. 146. i7) [1956] 2 S.C.R, 509, 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 905 \\he petitioners thflrein, held that the said transa- ctions were intra-State transactions and on that basis required them to file a statement of return of total purch11se of tobacco ma.de by them, this court, on a correct view of the transactions came to the conclusion that they related to inter-State trade and, on that view, enforced thelfundamental right of the petitioners. Though there was no decision of the Sales-tax: authorities that the transactions were intra-State, the notice was on that basis ; but yet that did not prevent this Court from oomin2 to a different conclusion and enforcing the fundamental right of the petitioners. In Messrs. Ram Narain Sons Ltd. v. Asstt. · Commissioner of Sale-tax (1) the Sales-tax authorities determined the turnover of the petitioners including therein the proceeds of sales held by them to be intra-State transa.otions. This Court held, considering the nature of the tran- 8&otions once again, that they were not sales inside the State and were only sales in the course of inter- State trade and commerce, and, on that basis; enforced the fundamental right of the petitioners. This Court again enfm·ced the fundamental rights of the petitioners in J. V. Gokul & Co. v. Asstt. Collector of Sale-tax (2j by reversing the finding of the Sales-tax Officer, who had held that the sales in that case were intra-State and holding that they were made in the course of import. Ignoring the first decision wherein there was no order of the Sa.lea-tax Officer on merits, in the other two decisions, the Sale-tax Officer in exeroise of his jurisdiction decided on the facts before him that the sales were intra-State sales, whereas this Court on a reconsideration of the facts held that they were outside sales.

Ujjam Bai v. State of Ullar Pradesh Subba Bao J. 906 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1963] has inherent jurisdiction to decide the question whether the sales were inside sales or outside sales. But an attempt is made to distinguish these oases on the ground that by a wrong view of the transac- tions, the sales-tax Officer violated the provisions of Art. 286 of the Constitution, and therefore he had no inherent jurisdiction to impose the tax. There are no merits in this distinction. The Sales-tax Officer had jurisdiction to dAoide under the relevant sales·tax Act whether a transaction was inside or outside sale. He had the jurisdiction to decide rightly or wrongly; on the basis of his finding, though a wrong one, the sales were 11ot exempt from taxt.tion. If, on the facts of the ease, the Sales-tax Officer had arrived at the correct conolu- tion, he would not have any power to impose a tax on inter-State sales µnder the Act; he would also have infringed Art. 286 of the Constitution, if he had imposed a tax on such a sale. The absence of juri.ddiotion or want of power in one case was trace- able to a statutory injunction, and in the otb.er to a constitutional prohibition; but that in itself cannot sustain the distinction in th.e application of the criterion of jurisdiction, for in either case the said wrong finding of fact was the root of the error. The decision of this Court in Kailash Nath v. State of U. P. ('), which necessitated the reference to this Bench, is another instance where this Court enforced the fundamental right of the peti- tioner by accepting an interpretation of the pro- visions of the !'alesctax Act different from that put upon them by the S:i.les-tax authority. l'here, as in the present oat10, the question depended upon the interpretation of the terms of a notifioatio1;1 iesued under s. 3 of the Sales-tax Act exempting certain goods from taxation. It is said that the view of this Court was based upon the judgments of this Court enforcing fundamental right!! on the ground that the impugned provisions whereunder tax wu (I) AI.R. 1917 S.C. 790. l S.C.R. SUPREME OOtJRT REPORTS 907 levied were ultra vires. But the objection taken before this Court in that case was that the imposi- tion of an illegal tax would not entitle a citizen to invoke Art. 32 of the Constitution, but he must resort to the remedies avai1able under the ordinary law or proceed under Art. 226 of the Constitution. \"But that argument was negatived on the basis of the decisions cited before them. The test of juris- dection now sought to be applied.was not directly raised in that Case. It cannot therefore be said that this Court went wrong by relying upon irrelevant decisions. The discussion shows that this Court held in the manner it did as it came to the conclu- tion that a fundamental right h1-d been cle11rly infringed by a wrong interpretation of the notification. Let me now consider the decisions of this Court which a.re alleged to have departed from the· view expressed in that case. In Gula/Jdas &: Co. v. Asstt. Collector of Ct.t.!toms(l), the petitioners were established importers holding quota rights for im- porting stationery articles and having their places of business in Calcutta. They had a licence for a period of 12 months to import goods known as. \"Artists' Materials\" fa.Hing under Serial No. 168(C) of Part IV of the Policy Statement. Item No. 11 of Appendix XX annexed to the Import Trade Control Policy Book was described as ucrayons\". The petitioners, on the be.sis of the licence, im- ported \"Lyra\" brand crayons. The Assistant Collector of Customs instead of assessing duty on them under itP,m 45(A), assessed duty under item 45 (4) of the Indian Customs Tariff. On appeal the Central Board 0f Revenue confirmed it. It was argued, imer alia, that the Customs authorities im- posed a. duty heavier than the goods had to bear under the relevant provisions. This Court held that no question of fundamental right arose in that case. {1) .U R. [1957] S. C, 733, 736. 196! Smt, Ujjam B• i v. Blet. 01 Utior p,aduh Bubba Rco J, 1968 Srr.t. Ujjam Bai v. State of Uttar P1a<ksh Suiba Rao J. 908 SUPRBME COURT REPORTS [1963] In that context, the following observations were made. \"If the provision of law under which the impugned orders have been passed are good provisions and the orders passed are with juriHdiction, whether they be right or wrong on facts, there is really no queetion of the in· fraction of a fundamental right. If a parti- cular decision is erroneous on facts or merits, the proper remedy is by way of an appeal.\" \"If the petitioners were aggrieved by the order of the Central Board of Revenue they had a further remedy by way of an appli- cation for revision to the Central Government ......•••... All that is really contended is that the orders are erroneous on merits. That surely does not give rise to the violation of any fundamental right under Art. 19 of the Constitution\". In that case, on facts, the Customs authorities held that the petitioners were liable to pay a particular duty on the goods, and this Court accepted that finding and, therefore, no question of fundamental right arose. But, if on the other hand the observa· tions meant that the order of the Customs authori- ties was binding on f,his Court, I find it difficult to accept that view. It is one thing to say that this Court ordinarily will accept the findings of adminis- trative tribunals on questions of fact, and it is an- other to say that the said finding are binding on this Court. I do not think that this Comt intended to lay down that the findings of administmtive tribunals are binding on thia Court, however, erroneous or unjust the said findings may be.

The finding was purely one of fact, and this Court accepted: it as correct: on that basis. no question of fundamental right would arise. The decision in Tke Parbhani :Pransport Co-operative Society Ltd. v. 1 1he Regional Transport Authority, Aurangabad (1) related to the fundamental right of the petitioner therein to carry on the business of plying motor buses as staae carriages.

The Regional Transport Authority rejected the peti- tioner's right and granted the p<1rmit to the State. One of the contentions raised was that the provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution had been infringed. This Court held that the Regional Transport Autho- rity, on the facts, had held that there was no dis- crimination. Dealing with that contention, this Court observed: \"This contention is in our view elearly untenable.

If the findings stand no question of fundamental right would a.rise. The decision in A. V. Venkateswaran, Collector of Cu;;toma Bombay v. Ranwhand Sobhraj Wadhwani (') is of no assistance, as it was a. decision under Art. 226 of the Constitution. In Aniyoth K·unhamina Umma v. The Ministry of Rehabilitation, Government of lnd·ia, New Delhi('), th'3 petitioner therein filed a. writ petition for enforcement of his fundamental right on the ground that the property in question was not evacuee property. The authorities under the relevant Act decided that it was an evacuee property, and the petitioner carried the matter to the appellate tribunals without su<Joess. This Court dismissing the petition on the ground that the peti· tioner had no fundamental right made the follow· ing observations: \"It is, indeeJ, true that s. 28 of the Act cannot affect the power of the High Court under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution or of this Court under Arts. 136 and 32 of the Constitution. Where, however, on account of tho decision of an authority of competent jurisdiction the right all!'ged by the petitioner has been found not to exist, it is difficult to see how any question of infringement of that right can arise as a ground for a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution, unless the decision of the authority of competent jurisdio- ( I) (1962) Is c.R. 753. (2) (1962) I s.c.R. 5Q5, 3.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 911 tion on the right alleged by the petitioner is held to be a nullity or can be otherwise got rid of. As long as that decision stands, the petitioner cannot complain of any infringe- ment of a fundamental right. The alleged fundamental right of the petitioner is really dependent on whether Kunhi Moosa Haji was an evacuee and whether his property is eva- cuee property. If the decision of the appro- priate authorities of competent jurisdiction on these questions has become final and can- not be treated as a nullity or cannot be otherwise got rid of, the petitioner cannot complain of any infringement of her funda- mental right under Arts. HJ(l}(f) and 31 of the Constitution.'' Concluding the judgment, it was observed: ''We are basing our decision on the ground that the competent authorities under the Act had come to a certain decision, which decision has now become final the petitioner not ha.ving moved against that decision in an appropriate court by an appropriate procee- ding. As long as that decision stands, the petitioner cannot complain of the · infring(l- ment of a fundamental right, for she has no such right.\" It would be seen that the tribunals found, on the facts of that case, that the property was evacuee property, and if that finding was accepted, no question of fundamental right arose. It is true that this Court accepted that finding on the ground that it had become final and the petitioner had not questioned the correctness of that decision in a proper court by an appropriate proceeding. As I have said earlier, this Court may ordinarily accept the findings of fact arrived at by tribunals; but, on the other hand, if the judgment meant tha.t under no conceivable circumstances this Court could !<162 Smt.

Stat1 of U.lat' Pradesh Subba Rao J, 912 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] interfere with the findings of an administ.ratiTe tribunal even if there was a clear infringement of fundamental right, in my view; it \\vould amount to an abdication of its jurisdiction in favour of administrative tribunals. Nor does the decision of this Court in JJf adan Lal Arora v. The Excise & Taxa- tion Officer, Amritsar (1) carry the matter further. There, the petitioner was a dealer registered under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act. Notice1 were served on him by the Sales tax authority, the last of them being that i( the relevant documents were not produced, within a particular date the case would be decided on the •'best judgment assessment basis\". It was contended on the basis of s. 11 of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act that at the date of the notice last mentioned the Sales Tax authori · ties bad no right to proceed to make any \"best judgment\" as8essment as the three years within which only such assessment could be made had expired before then. This Court accepted the con- struction put forward by the petitioner and held that no assessment could be made on the petitioner; and, in that view, it enforced his fundamental right. There was no inherent want of jurisdiction in the Sales Tax authorities, for they had jurisdiction to construe the relevant provisions of s. 11 and hold whether the assessment could be made within a particular time or not. Notwithstanding that cir- cumstance, this Court enforced the petitioner's fun- damental right. It is not necessary to multiply decisions. On a superficial reading of the aforesaid decisions, though they may appear to be conflicting, there is one golden thread which runs through all of them and, that is, a citizen has a guaranteed procedural right under Art. 32 of the Constitution, and that a duty is cast upon this Court to enforce a fundamental right if it is satisfied that the peti- tioner has a fundamental right and that it ha.s lieen (IJ (1962) 1 s.c.R. s2s. I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 913 infringed by the State. That question was approa· ched by this Court from different perspectives, having regard to the faots of each case. When a funda.menta.l right of a petitioner was infringed by an action of an officer purporting to exercise a power under an Act which is ultra vires or unconstitutional, or without jurisdiction, this Court invariably enforced the fundamental right. So too, this Court give relief under Art. 3~ of the Constitution whenever a statutory authority infrin· ged a fundamental right of petitioner on a. wrong construction of the provisions of a statute where- under he purported to act. This Court, as a rule of practice, accepted the findings of fact arrived at by tribunals and on that basis held that no f tllldamental right was infringed. But I do not understand any of these decisions as laying down tha.t the amplitude of the jurisdiction conferred on this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution a.nd the guaranteed right given to a citizen under the said article should be restricted orjlimited by some principle or doctrine not contemplated by the Constitution. Mr. Cbairi, appearing for one of the intervener&, raised a wider question. His argument ia that a relief under Act. 3~ cannot be given against an '4Uthority exercising judicial power and that the Sales-tax a1n.tio.rities a.re authorities exercising judicial power of the State. This argument is elaborated thus : Under tbe Constitution, the in~titutions created theireunder can exercise either legislative, exeo11tive or judicial functions and some- times the same institution may have to exercise OiltJ or more of the said powers; institutions exerci- sing legislative powers make la we, those exercising powers, administer the laws, and those exercising judicial powers deoide the disputes between citizens and oitizeDB, between citizens and ~tate and ~tate, the said judicial powers can be conferred in the 1962 Smt.

Article 32 enables the Supreme Court to enforce a fundamental right only against the State action; no fundamental dght can he enforced against an officer exercising judicial power as he does not come under the definition of Htate in Art. 12 of the Constitution. It is not necessary in this case to decide the two questions, namely, (1) whether a person can approach this Court to enforce his fundamental right on the ground that it was infringed by a deci- sion of a court of law, and (2) whether the right guaranteed by Art. 19 of the Constitution can be enforced under Art. 32 a.gainst the action of a pri- vate individual. We are concerned only with the narrow question whether such a right can be enfor. ced against the action of an administrative tribunal. It can certainly be enforced against it, if it comes under the definition of a State under Art. 12 of the Constitution. We have already held that an a.dmi· nistra.ti ve tribunal is not a. court but is only an executive authority functioning uhder a. statute adopting the norms of judicial procedure. It is a. department of the executive Government exercising statutory functions affecting the rights of parties. Under Art. 12, '•the State\" has been defined to in- clude the Government and the Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of ea.ch of the States and all local and other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. A Division Bench of the Madras High Court in University of Madras v. Shanta Bai (1) construed the words \"local or other autho· l'ities'' under Art. l~ of the Constitution thus: \"These words must be construed as (I) A-1.R. 1954 Mad. 67 068. .. • • < 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 915 1961 ejusdem generis with Government or Legisla- ture and so construed can only mean autho- rities exercising governmental functions. '!'hey would not include persons natural or juristic who cannot be regarded as instrumentalities Smt. Ujjam Bai of the Government.\" Applying this definition to Art. 12, it is manifest that authorities constituted under the Sales-tax Act for assessing the tax would be \"other authori· ties\" within the meaning of Art. 12; for the said authorities exercise governmental functions and are the instrumentalities of the Government. But it is contended that if the fathers of our Constitution intended to include in the definition authorities exercising judicial functions, having included the Government and the Parliament, they would not have omitted to mention specifically the judicial institutions therein. This argument may have some relevance if the question is whether a court of law is included within the definition of ' '·St.ate\", but none when the question is whether an administrative tribunal is included in the said defini- tion. An administrative tribunal is an executive authority and it is clearly comprehended by the words ''other authorities\". If the argument of learned counsel be accepted, Government also shall be excluded from the definition where it exercises quasi-judicial functions. So too, Parliament ·will have to be excluded when it exercises a quasi-judi- cial function. That would be to introduce words which are not in the Article. It is, therefore, clear to my mind that the definition of the word, whether it takes in a court or not, certainly takes in adminis- tr·itive tribunah1. If an administrative tribunal is a •·State\" and if any order made or action taken by it infringes a fundamental right of a citizen under Art. 19 of the Constitution, it can be enforced under Art. 32 thereof. Let me now restate the legal position as I •• St•t1 nJ Utt11r Pra'!esh SubbaR .. J. 1961 Sn11. Uii•m B•i v. State of Ullgr l'rade•h Snbba Rao J. 916 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] conceive it: (I) A citizen has a fundamental right to carry on business in bidis under Art. 19 (1) of the Constitution. (2) The State may make a law impo· sing reasonable restrictions on that right: it is con- ceded that the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act is such a law. (3) The Sales-tax authorities constituted under the Act, purporting to exercise their powers there- under, may make an illegal order infringing that right. ( 4) The order may be illegal because the autho- rity concerned has acted without jurisdiction in the sense that the authority is not duly constituted under the Act or that it has inherent want of jurisdiction; the order may be illegal also because the said autho· rity has construed the relevant provisions of the Act wrongly and has decid<!d the facts wrongly or drawn the inferences from the facts wrongly. (5) The Act expressly or by necessary implication cannot give finality to the order of the authority or authorities so as to prevent the Supreme Court from question- ing its correctness when the said order in faot affects the fundamental right of a citizen. (6) The aggrie- ved party may approach this Conrt before a d\"lcision io given by the Sa.Jes-tax authority or after the deci- sion is given by the original authority or when an appeal is pending before the appellate tribunal or after all the remedies under the Act are exhausted. (7) Whatever may be the stage at which this Court is approached this Court may in it• discretion, if the question involved is one of jurisdiotion or a oons· truction of a. provision, decide the question and enforce the right without waiting till the procedure prescribed by a law ia exhausted; but if it finds that questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law are involved, it may give an opportunity to the party, if he agrees, to renew the application after he has exhausted his remedies under the Aot, or, if he does not agree, to adjourn the petition till after the remedies are exhausted. (8) If the fundamental right of the petitioner depends upon the findings of fact arrived at by the M.Iministrative tribunals in I $.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS ~17 exercise of the powers conferred on them under the Act, this Court ma.y in its discretion ordinarily accept the findings and dispose of the application on the basis of those findings. The followin~ of this procedure preserves the jurisdiction of thiR Court as envisaged by the Cons· titution and safeguards the guaranteed rights of the citizens of this country without at the same time affecting the smooth working of the administrative tribunals created under the Act. If the other view is accepted, this Court will be abdicating its jurisdic- tion and entrusting it to administrative tribunals, who in a welfare State cpntrol every conceivable aspect of human activity and are in a dominant position to infringe the fundament,a.l rights guaran- teed to the citizens of this country. I would prefer this pragmatic approach to one based on concepts extraneous to the doctrine of fundamental rights. I would, therefore, hold that in the present case if the Sales-tax: officer; by a wrong construc~ion of the provisions of the Act, made '1.n illegal order imposing a tax on the . petitioner's] fundamental right, it is liable to be quashed. The next q1lestion is whether the Sales-tax officer has wrongly construed the notification issued by the Government under s. 4(l)(a) of the Aot. Sec- tion 4( 1) of the Act reads as follows: \"No tax shall be payable on- (a) The· sale <;>f water, milk, sal~ newspa• pers and motor Apirit as defined in the U. P.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS The following facts a.re not disputed : In regard to the sales of certain commodities with an inter- State market certain difficulties cropped up in the matter ol impoaiti9.n of sales-tax by different States. In order to avoia those difficulties, the Central Government and the States concerned came to an arrangement whereunder the States agreed for the enhancement of the excise duties under the Central Aot in respect of certain commodities in substitu- tion for the sales-tax levied upon them, and that the Central Government agreed to collect the en- hanced excise duty on the sa.id commodities and distribute the additional income derived amongst the State Governments. To implement that arrange- ment, Parliament passed Act No. 58of1957 called the Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act, 1957, on December 24, 1957. The long title of that Act shows that it was enacterl to provide for the levy and collection of additional duties of excise on certain goods and for the distri- bution of -a part of the net proceeds thereof among the States in pursuance of the principles of distri- bution formulated and the recommendation made by the Finance Commission. Under the Central Act, before the amendment, there was excise duty on tobacco used for various purposes, including ma.chine-made bidis, but there was no excise duty on hand-made bidis. Therefore, under the amended Act; additional duty was payable only on tobacco product.a already taxable under original Act ; with the result, enhanced tax was imposed on tobacco which went in to make hand-ma.de bidis, but no additional tax was imposed on hand-made bidis. With this background let us .Jook at the notification issued under a. 4(1) of the Act. There is some controversy whether that notification was issued l_lnder s. 4(l)(a) or 4(l)(b) of the Act; but that need not detain us, for I shall assume that the notification was issued under s. 4( 1 )(b). The 1961 Smt. Ujj•m B:1i v. Sta ' of Utf4r Pradesh Sub/JG Rao J. 1962 Smt. Ujj!Jm Bt., v. St1l1 of Utlo 1 Pradesh Sul.Ua ROD J, 920 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1963] goods specified therein were exempted conditionally. The goods exempted under the notification were bidis and tobacco. Bidis migpt be hand·made or machine-made, and the tobacco included tobaoco out of which bidis were made. Under the first part of the notification the said bidis and tobaooo were exempted from the sales-tax from Deoember 14, 1957. The condition imposed for the operation of that exemption was that additional central excise duties levia.ble thereon from the closing of business on December 13, 1957, should have been paid on such bidis and tobacco. Briefly stated, the bidiH and tobacco, among others, were exempted from pay· ment of sales-tax, if excise duties leviable thereon were paid during the relevant period. So far as the hand-made bidis were conoerened under the amend· ing Act no tax was leviable thereon. The condition was applicable to bidis as a unit. Out of bidis, no excise duty was leviable on hand-made bidis, \"bile excise duty was leviable in respect of machine-made bidis. Therefore, the condition imposed ha1 no appli· cation to hand-made bidis, for 1mder the eaid condi· tion only tax leviable on the said bidis had to be paid, and, as no excise duty was leviable in respect of hand-made bidis, they were clearly exempted under the said notification, Assu· ming that the said notification applied only to goods in respect whereof additional excise duty we.a leviable, the payment of additional duty in respect of tobacco which went in makinjl' hand-made bidis was also a condition attached to the exem- ption of such bidis from taxation. It is not dis- puted that additional exoise duty on the said tobacco was paid by the appellant. I, therefore, hold, on a plain reading of the expressed terms of the notification, that hand-made bidis were exempted from taxation under the Aot. • . 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 921 There was also every justification for such exemption. It appears from tbe record that the merchants doing business in hand -made bidis were not able to compete with businessmen manufactu- ring machine-made bidis. Indeed, before the amen- ding Act, excise duty was imposed on machine-made bidis ma.inly, though not solely, for protecting the business in the former in competition with the latter. In the circumstances, it was but reasonable to ~ume that the State Government by the amending Act did not intend to impC'se sales-tax on hand- made bidis, though additional excise duty was im- posed on tobacco out of which the said bidis were manufactured. The entire scheme of protection of one against unfair competition from the other would break if the Central Government could impose addi- tional excise duty on tobacco and the State could impose sales-tax on bidis madti out of the said tobacco. That this was the intention of the State Government was made clear by the subsequent noti- fication dated December 14, 1957, exempting hand- inad~ 1Jidi8 from taxation without any condition. I am, therefore, clearly of the opinion that, on a fair reading of the said notification, sales of hand-made bidis were exempted from taxation under the Act.c !n the result, there will be an order directing the respondents not to proceed to realize any sales- tax from the petitioner on the basis of the order dated Deceiuber 20, 1958. 'The petitioner will have h.~r costs. . Now coming to Ciyil Appeal No. 572 of 1960, the saj~ app~l was dismissed for. non-prosecution by order ()rthi& Court dated, February 20, 1961.

HIDAYATULLAH, J.-The facts have been set out fully in the order of Venkata.rama Aiyar, J., and need not be stated at length. The petitioner is a partner in a firm of bidi manufacturers registered under the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act. Under a scheme by which certain additional Central Excise duties are being levied under special Acts for the purpose and are being distributed among the States in respect of certain classes of goods, on which the States have foregone collection of sales tax locally, the Government of Uttar Pradesh issued notifica- tion on December 14, 1957, exempting bidis from sales tax under the U. P. Sales Tax Act, provided the additional duties of excise were paid. This was followed by another notification on November 25, 1958, by which bidis, whether machine-made or hand-made, where exempted without any condition from sales tax from July 1, 1958. The dispute in this petition is about the quarter ending June 30, 1958, in which the firm claimed the exemption. This claim was rejected on the ground that the firm had not paid any additional exciae duty on bidis. An appeal followed, but was un- sucoessful, and though a revision lay under the Sales Tax Act, none was filed. 'l'he firm filed instead a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Allahabad, but was again uneucoeliBful, mainly because the firm had other remedies under the Sales Tax Act which it had not available of, The firm, however, obtained a oerti- ficate from the High Court, and filed an appeal in this Court.

Sales of Biris by the assessee are, therefore, liable to Sales Tax.\" Whether there has been a misconstruction of any of the provisions is a matt~r which, of course, could be considered on revision, or in a reference to the High Court on point of law arising out of the order finally passed or even ultimately by appeal to this Court with its special leave under Art. 136. The petitioner, however, contends that she is entitled to file a petition under Art. ~2 of the Constitution, if by a wrong construction of a provision of law, a tax is demanded which is not due because it amounts to a deprivation of property without authorit.y of law and also a restriction upon her right to carry on trade or business. The breach of fundamental rights is thus stated to arise under Arts. 31( l) and 19( I )(g) primarily by the wrong int 'rpretation and sooondarily by the result thereof, uamely, the de mand of a tax which is not due. The other side contends that no fundamental rights can be said to be breached when the authorities act under a valid law even though by placing their interpretation on some provision of law they may err, provided they have the judediotion to deal with the matter and follow the principles of natural justice. Any such error, according to the respondents, must be oorrec· ted by the ordinary process of appeals or revisions etc. and 11ot by a direct approach to the Supreme Court under Art. 32 of the Conlltitution. Both l!lides cite cases in which petitions under Art. 32 we.re pre- viously filed and disposed of by this Court, eithor by granting writ.I! or by dismissing the petitions. In some of them, the question was oonsidjir,ed, but in some it was not, because 110 objection waA ra;fled. There, however, appears to be some conflict on this point.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 925 wrongly refused on a misconstruction of a notifica- tion under s. 4 of the U.P. Sales Tax Aot, it was held that the fundamental rights of the taxpayer were in jeopardy, and the remedy under Art. 32 was open. Govinda Menon, J., then observed: ''If tax is levied without due leg&.l autho- rity on any trade or business, then it is open to the citizen aggrieved to approach this Court for a. writ under Article 32 since his right to carry on a trade is violated, or infringed by the imposition and such being the case Article J9(l)(g) comes into play.\" This proposition was rested upon the case of this Court in the Bengal Immunity Company (1}; but a close examination of the latter case shows that no such proposition wa::? stated there. In the latter case, exemption was claimed on the ground that the sales sought to be taxed were made in the course of inter-State trade and the Bihar Sales Tax Act, which purported to authorise such levy, offended Art. 286(2) of the Constitution and thus was invalid. On the other hand, doubts were cast on the decision in Kailash Nath's case ( 2 ) on this point, in Tata.Iron &: Steel Oo. Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar l3 ); but the question was left open. The question has now been raised and argued before this special Bench. In this judg- ment, I am only concerned with the -question of constitutional law raised, since I agree with the interpretation pla.cf\\d on the notificatien by my brother, Kapur, J. The genera.I principles underlying Pa.rt III of the Constitution have been stated so often by this Court that it is hardly necessary to refer to them, except briefly, before considering to what extent and in what circumstances aC1tions or orders of judi- cial, quasi-judicial and aalminiatrative authoritie& (1) (1955) 2 s.c.R. 603. l2) A.I.R.1957 s.c. 790, (3) (1961) i s.c.a.

Sith •f Utlar ,...,,, HIJ•y••ull•h \"• 926 SUPREME OOURT REPORTS [1963] are open to question under Art. 32. The Constitu- tion has accepted a democratic form of Govern- ment wi$h the characteri8tic division of authority of the State between he Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive. The Constitution being federal in form, there is a further division of powers between the Centre and the States. This division is also made in the juris- diction!' of the three Departments of the State. To achieve these purposes, the distribution of legisla- tive powers is indicated in Part XI and of taxes in Part XII, and certain special provisions regarding trade, commerce and intercourse within the territory of India are placed in Part XIII. In addition to the11e Parts .of the Constitution, to which some refe· rence may be necessary hereafter, the Constitution h&B also in other Parts indicated what things can only be done by law to be made by Parliament or the State Legislatures. These Articles are too numerous to specify here. But this much, however, is clear that where the Constitution says that a cer- tain thing can be done under authority of law, it intends to convey that no &ction is justified unless the legality of that action can be supported by & law validly made. The above is, in outline, the general pattern of conferral of power upon the Legislature and the Executive by the people. The people, however, regard certain rights as paramount, because they embrace liberty of action to the individual in matters of private life, social intercourse and share in the government of the country and other spheres. The people who vested the three limps of Government with their power and authority, at the same time kept back these rights of citizens and also sometimes of non-citizens, and made them inviolable except under certain con- ditions. The rights thus kept back are placed in Part III of the Constitution, which is headed \"Fundamental Rights\", and the col!ditions under I ·~ • I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 927 which these rights can be abridged are also indicated in that Part. Briefly stated, the conditions are that they can be abridged only by a Jaw in the public interest or to achieve a public purpose. These rights are not like the Directive Principles, which indicate the policy and general pattern for State action to enable India to emerge, after its struggle with poverty, disease, inequalities and prejudires, as a welfare State. These Directive Principles are not justiciable, but any breach of fundamental rights gives a causft of action to the aggrieved person. The sum total of this is that the Constitution insists upon the making of constitutional and otherwise valid laws as the first step towards State action. No arbitrary or capricious action affecting the rights of citizens and others is to be tolerated, if it is unsupported by such Jaw. But even the Legislature cannot go beyond the limits set by the Chapter on Fundamental Rjghts, because ingress upon those rights is either forbidden absolutely or on condition that the action is either in an emerg- ency or dictated by the overriding public interest. The executive can never affect the fundamental rights unless a valid Jaw enables that to be done. To secure these fundamental rights, the High Courts by Art. 226 as part of their genera.I jurisdiction and the Supreme Court by Art. 32 have been given the power to deal with any breach complained of and to rectify matters by the issue of directions, orders or writs including certain high prerogative writs. Article 32 is included in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights, and provides an expressly guaranteed remedy of approach to the Supreme Court in all cases where fundamental rights are invaded. This right is the most valuable right of the citizen against the State. The Article provides further that the right of moving the Supreme Court is also a fundamental right. Thus, it was that this Court said in RomR,ih, PIUJppar' s ease (1) that thia fl) [19501 S.C.R. 594,596,597. 1961 Smt. Ujjam Bai v. Sl<de of UUor Pf'aduh Hidoyatullali J. Ii 1911 wat.

It may, however, be stated that under certain Articles of the Constitution, laws can be made without a challenge in Court.a, notwithstanding the Constitu- tion (•e<', for example Art. 329), and other con•ide- rations may arise in respect of those laws. In this judgment, therefore, I shall deal with those laws and situations only, which admittedly are affected by the Chapter on Fundamental Rights. The invasion of fundamental rights may assume many forms. It may proceed directly from Jaws which conflict with the guaranteed rights. It may proceed from executive action unsupported by any valid law or laws or in spite of them. Examples of both kinds are to be found in the Reports. In K. 1'. Moopil Nair's case ('), a taxing statute was held to be discriminatory and also unreasonable because of the restrictions it created and was Mtruck down under Arts. 14 and 19 (1) (f) of the constitution. In Tata Iran & Steel Go., ltd. c11Be('), a threat to recover a tax twice over was said to offend fundamental rights. In both these cases, Art. 32 was invoked successfully. In the first kind of oases the law itself fails, and if the law fails, so does any action und~r it. In the second kind of casee, the laws are valid but in their application, (ll [19S01 S.C.R. :166.

The view expressed in the last case finds further support from what Gajendraga.dkar, J., ea.id very recently in Darya-0 v. The, State of U. P. ('): ''If the petition field in the High Court under Art. 226 is dismissed not on the merits but because of the !aches of the party apply- ing for the writ of because it is held that the party had an alternative remedy available to it, then the dismissal of the writ petition would not constitute a bar to a subsequent petition under Art. 32 except in cases where and if the facts thus found by the High Court may themselves be relevant even under Art. 32.\" Gajendragadkar, J. then went on to consider the matter from the point of view of res judicata, and held that in some cases, that principle would apply if no appeal against the order of the High Court was field, but not in others. This must be so, (I) [1962] I s.c,a. 51t. ., I I S.O.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 931 because if there is a decision of the High Court negating fundamental rights or their breach, then the decision of the competent Court must be removed by appeal to establish the rights or their breach. From these oases, it follows that what may be said about a direct appeal to this Court without following the intermediate steps may not be said a.bout Art. 32, because resort to other forums for parallel reliefs is strictly not necessary where a party complains of breach of fundamental rights. Of course, when he makes an application under Art. 32, he take ~he risk of either succeeding or failing on that narrow issue, and a finding of the High Court or some tribunal below on some point, if not 1et aside in appropriate proceedings, may stand in his way. The right under Art. 32 is not a right of appeal, and cannot be used as such, and this Court may not be in a position to examine the case with the same amplitude as in an appeal. But, if a party takes the risk of coming to this court direot on the narrow issue, he cannot be told that he has other remedies. To take this restricted view of Art. 32 may, in some cases, by delay or expense in- volved in the other remedies, defeat the fundamental rights before even they oa.n be claimed. But this is not to say that the other remedies are otiose. The iBBue to be tried under Art. 32 is a narrow one, and once that issue fails, everything else must fail. In jurisdictions like that under Art. 226 and/or in appeals under Art. 132 or Art. 136, not only can the breach of fundamental rights be considered but all other matters which the Court may permit to be raised. It, therefore, follows that if a person chooses to invoke Art. 32, he cannot be told that he must go elsewhere first. The right to move this Court is gnara.nteed. But this Court in. dealing with the petition will deal with it from the narrow =int of £und-.Jrtal •• and •ot as .. 1961 Sme. Ujjam Bai v • State of Uttar Pr a\"\" sh 190I Sml, Ujjom Boi ..

The power to issue writs in the nature of the five high prerogative writs of heheas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari is, in itself, sufficient to compel obedience by the State (as defined in Art. 12) a.nd observance by it of the Constitution and the laws in all cases where a breach of fundamental right or rights is established. The writ of mandamus is a very fle- xible writ and has always been called in aid to am- pliate justice and proves sufficient in most cases of administrative lapses or excesses. Then, there is the writ of certiorari to get rid of orders which affect fundamental rights, the writ of prohibition to stop action before it can be completed, the writ of quo warrnto to question a wrongful assumption of office, and lastly, the writ of habeas corpus to secure liber- ty. Indeed, an observed by Lord Atkin (then, Atkin, L. J.) in Rex v. Electricity Commissioners('): \"Whenever any body or persons having legal authority to determine questions affect- ing the rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially act in excess of their legal authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the Kings Bench Division exercised in these writs.\" What was said of judicial action and of the writ of certiorari applies equally to other writs and actions of administrative agencies, which are execu- tive or ministerial. The powers of the Supreme Court and the High Courts in our country are no whit less than those of the Kings Rench Division. Indeed, the power conferred on him is made even more ample by enabling these superior Courts to issue in addition to the Prerogative Writs, direc- tions orders and writs other than the named wtita, and the concluding words of Art. 32 (2} \"whioi.evet (1) (l!laf) IL B.171, 20$. .. 1 s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 933 may be appropriate, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part (Part III)\" show the wide ambit of the power. As far back as Basa'PPa v. Nagappa (1), Mukherjea, J. (as he then was) observed: \"In view of the express provisions in our Constitution we need not now Jook back to the early history or the procedural technical- ities of these writs in English law, nor feel oppressed by any differences or change of opinion expressed in particular cases by English Judges.\" Speaking then· of the writ of certiorari the learned Judge added: ''We can make an order or issue a writ in the nature o( certiorari in all appropriate cases and in appropriate manner, so longa.s we keep to the broad and fundamental princi- ples that regulate the exercise of jurisdiction in the matter of granting such writH in English law.'' What has been said here has my respectful concurrence, and is applicable to the other wtjta also. These principles have now become firmly esta.bli~ed in the interpretation of Arts. 32 '»ld 226 of the Constitution. The difference in tne two Ai:ti- cles is in two respects:· firstly, Art, 32 is available only for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but the High Courts can use the powers for other pur- pQaes (a power which Parliament can also confer on the Supreme Court by law, vide Art. 139), and secondly, that the right of moving the Supre1JJ.e CQurt is itself a guaranteed right (Art. 32 (I) and is unaffeoted by the powers o/ the High Court (Art. 226 (2) ).

Those provisions give an indi- cation of how the Supreme Court is intended to use its powers. The Supreme Court is me.de, by Arts. 133 and 134, the final Court of appeal over the High Court in all civil and criminal matters, though the right of appeal arises only in certain ole.sses of cases and subject to certain conditions. Under Arts. 132 and 133 (2), the Supreme Court is also the final Court of appeal over the High Court in all matters involving an interpretation of the Constitution. By Art. 136, the Supreme Court has been given the power to grant, in its discretion, speoie.l leave to appeal to itself from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any Court or tribunal in the territory of India. The last power is overriding, beoause Art. 136 commences with the words \"notwithstanding any thing in this Chapter\". Only one exemption has been made in favour of a Court or tribunal cons- tituted by or ordered under any law relating to the Armed Forces. There are other jurisdictions of the Supreme Court also, whioh may be qescribed as advisory and original, arising in special circumstances with which we are not concerned. The appellate jurisdi- ction of the Supreme Court sets it at the top of the hierarchy of civil and oriminal Courts of civil judi- cature. Articles 132, 133, 134 and 135 make the Supreme Court the fine.I Court of appeal but only in cases which are first carried before the High Court in accordance with the law relating to those cases. Access to the Supreme Court under Arts. 132-135 is not direct but through the High Court. There can be no abridging of that process. But, under Art. 136, the Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to ·- t S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 935 grant special leave, though it has declared in seve- ral cases that it would exercise it1 discretion under Art. 136 only against a final order. Bee Ohandi Prasad Olwlckani v. State of Bihar (1). Indian Alum- inium Co. v. OommiBsioner of lnoome tax ( 2), and Kankaiyalal Lokia v. Oommissioner of Income-tax (•). In exercising the discretionary powers to grant special leave, the Supreme Court now insists on the aggrieved party exhausting all its remedies under the law before approaching it. From what has been said above, it is clear that there are three approaches to this Court, and they are: (a) by appeal against the decision of the High Court, (b) by special leave granted by this Court against the decision of any Court or tribunal in India. and (c) by a petition under Art. 32. No Court or tribunal in India other than the Supreme Court and the High Courts has been invested with the jurisdiction to deal with breaches of funda- mental rights, though the Constitution has reser- ved the power to Parliament to invest by law this jurisdiction in any other Court [Art 32 (3)]. As a result, the enforcement of fundamental rights can only be had iii the High Court or the Supreme Court. In most taxation laws, there is a jurisdiction and a right to invoke . the advisory jurildiotion of the High Court and in some there is a right of appeal or revision to the High Court, but the .question of a breach of fundamental rights cannot be raised in the prooeedings before the tribunals. In its advis- ory jurisdiction, the High Court can only anewer the question referred to it or raise one which arises out of the order passed and in its appellate and revisional jurisdiction, the High Court oan deal with ~he matter on law or fact or both (as the case may be) but only in so far as the tribunal has the jurisdiction. In these jurisdictions, the plain quest;. ion of the enforcement of fundamental rights may (1) (1962) 2 s. c. R.. 2'6.

There is, however, nothing to prevent a party moving a separate petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution and raising the issue, as was actually done in this case. The result thus is that no question of a hr-each of fundamental rights can arise except under Arts. 226 and 32 of the Constit· ution, and it must be raised before the High Court and the Supreme Court respectively, by a proper petition. But, where the High Court decide!! such an issue on a petition under Art. 226, the question can be brought before this Court under Arts. 132 and 136. If this be the true position, and if this Court can only deal with question of breach of funda- mental rights in petitions under Art. 32 and in appeals against the orders of the High Court under Art. 226, I am of opinion that a petition under Art. 32 must always lie where a breach)s complained of, though, I must say again, if the matter is brought before this Court under Art. 32, the only question that can be considered is the breach of funda- mental rights and none other. The right to move this Court being guaran· teed, the petition may lie, but there are other thing to consider before it can be said in what cases this Court will interfere. I shall now con8i- der in what kind of cases the powers under Art. 32 will be used by this Court. Since this case arises under a taxing statute, I shall confine myself to taxing laws, because other considerations may arise in other circumstances and the differing facts are sometimes so subtle as to elude one, unless they are before him. The challenge on the ground of a breach of fundamental rights may be against a law 6r against executive action. I am leaving out of account action by the Courts of civil judicature, and am not pausing to consider whether the word \"State\" as defined in Art. 12 includes the ordinary Courts of civil judicature. That question does not S.C.R. SUPREME OOURT REPORTS 937 arise here and must be left for decision in a case in which it properly does. Whether or not be word \"State'' covers the ordina.ry Courts, there is autho- rity to show tha.t tribu11a.ls which play the dua.l role as dooiding issues in a qua.si-judioial way and acting as the instrumentalities or Governmeints are within the word \"State\" as used in Part· III of the Consti- tution. In the Bidi Supply Oo., v. Union of lndia(1), Das, C. J., observed: \"Here •the State' which includes its lncome·tax department has by an illegal order denied to the petitioner, as compa.red with other Bi di merchants who , are similarly situate, equality before the law or the equal •protection of laws and the petitioner can legi- timately complain of an infraction of ~is fund- amental rights under article 14 of thA Consti- tution.\" Again, in GuUapaUi Nage.JJWara Rao v. SUite of Andkra Prade.sh (2 ) it was observed: \"The concept or a quasi-judicial act implies that the act is not wholly judicial; it describes only a duty cast on the executive body or authority to oonf orm to norms of judicial procedure in performinl? some acts in ex~roise of its executive power.\" The taxing departments are instrumentalities of the State. They are not a part of the legislature; nor a.re they a part of the judiciary. Their functions are the assessment and collection of taxes, and in the prooeas of assessing taxes, they have po follow & pattern or •ctioa, which is 'considered judicial. They &re not thereby coverted into Courts of civil judio&ture. They stiU remain the instrumentalities of the State l\\Dd are within the definition of 'State' in Art. 12. In this view of the m11.tter, their actions (I' (JCl!6) SC.R. 267, 277. (2) {l 959) Sul'P. l S.C.R 319, 353, 3Sf. 1962 Smt. fljjam Bai v. SMeof Utlar P1qt/eJh Hida;ialullah J. 1962 Smi. Ujjam Bai v.

Hid•>alullflh J. 938 SUPREME COURT REI'ORTS [1963] must be regarded, in the ultimate analysis, as execu- tive in nature, since their determinations result in the demand of tax wh.ich neithr·r the legislature nor the judiciary c.m collect. TJ-rns, the actions of these quasi-judicial bodies may be open to challenge on the-ground of breach of fundamental rights. I have already said that the attack on funda- mental rights may proceed from laws or from exe- cutive aotion. Confining myself to taxation laws and executive action in furtherance of taxation laws, I shall now indicate how the breaches of fundamen- ta.l rights c»n arise and the extent of interference by this Court under Art. 32. Taxing Jaws have to con- form to provisions in Part XII of the Constitution: they are circumscribed further by Part XIII, and they can only be made by an appropriate legislature as indicated in Part XI. These are the provisions dealing with the making of taxing laws. The total effect of these provisions is summed up in Art. 165, which says: \"No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.\" Law is thus a condition precedent to the demand of a tax. A tax cannot be levied by the State, un- less a law to that effect exists, and that law must follow and obey all the directions in the Constitu- tion about· the· making of laws. In other words, the law must be one validly made. Taxation laws may suffer from two defects, and they are: (a) if they are not made within the four corners of the powers conferred by the Consti- tution Oll thP particular legislature, Or (b) if ther, are opposed to fundamental rights. A law may fail as ultra vires, though it is not opposed to fundamen- tal rights, because it, is outside the powers of the legislature that enacted it, or because it is a colour- able exercise of power, or if the law was not made in accordance with the special procedure for making l S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 939 it. A simple example is imposition of Profession Tax by Parliament, which it has no power to i~pose, or the imposition of a tax above Rs. 250 per year on a single person by the State Legislature, which is beyond the powers of the State Legislature. In these cases, the laws fail, because in the first case, Parliament lacks the power completely, and in the second, because the State Legis]ature trans- gresses a limit set for it. Such a law is no law at all, and will be struck down under Art. 265 read with the appropriate provisions of the Constitution. A qu~stion arising under Art. 265 cannot be brought before the Supreme Court under Art.32, because that Article is not in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights. But an executive action to enforce the law would expose the executive action to the processes of Arts. 226 and 32, if a fu~damental right to carry on a profession or an occupation, trade or bui?iness is put in jeopardy. In the order of reference in this case, this position is summed up in the following observation: ''Where the provision is void, the protec· tion under Art. 265 fails, and what remains is only unauthorised interference with property or trade by a State Officer, and.articles 19(l)(f) and (gl are· attracted.\"· Where the law fails being opposed to funda- mental rights as, for example, when it is void because it involves discrimination or otherwise invades rights protected by Part III, the protection of Art. 265 is again lost. Indeed, the Jaw fails not because of Art. 265 but because of Art. 13, and a cause of action under Art. 35· may arise. This was reco~ised in K. T. Moopil Nair v. State of Kerala( 1 ) where it w~s observed: . , \"Article 265 imposes a limitation on the taxing power .of the State in so far as it provides that the State shall not levy or CI> c1g&1) s s.c.R. 11. 1982 Smt.

It has to be don\" by authority of law, which· must mean valid law. In order that the law may be valid, the tax proposed to be levied must be within the legislative competence of the Legislature im- posing a tax and authorising the collection thereof and, secondly, the tax must be subject to the condit,ions laid down in Art. 13 of the Constitution. One of such cJnditioos envisaged by Art. 13(2) is that the L~gislature shall not ma.ke any Jaw which takes away or abridges the equality clause in Art. 14, which enjoins the State not to deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws of the country. It cannot be disputed that if the Act infringe3 the provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution, it m1i<t be struck down as unconstitutional\". This arose in a petition under Art. 32 of the Cons- titution. It appears that taxation laws were unsuccess- fully challenged under Art. 32 of1 the Constitution as a brPach of Art. 31( 1) in Ramjilal's case(') and Laxmanappa Hanumantappa v. Union of India('). In the former, the reason given was: \"Reference has next to be made to article 265 which is in Part XII, Chapter I. dealing with 'Finance'. That article provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law. There was no similar pro- vision in the corresponding chapter of the Government of India Act, 1935. If collection of taxes amounts to deprivation of property within the meaning of Art. 31 ( 1 ), then there was no point in making a separat.e provi8icn (!) (1951) S.C.R.127. (2) (195) 1 S C.R. 769. I 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 941 again as has been made in article 265. It, therefore, follows that cla.use (1) of article 31 must be regarded as concerned with depriva- tion of property otherwise than by the impo- sition or . collection of tax, for otherwise article 265 becomes wholly redundant ........ . In our opinion, the protection against imposi- tion and collection of taxes save by authority of the law directly comes from article 265, and is not secured by clause ( 1) of article 31. Article 265 not being in Chapter III of the Constitution, its protection is not a fundamen- tal right which can be enforced by an applica- tion to this Court under article :.12.ilt is not our purpose to say that the right secured by arti- cle 265 may not be enforced. It may certainly be enforced by adopting proper proceedings. All that we wish to state is that this applica.- tion in so far as it purports to be founded ct>n article 32 read with article 31(1) to this Court is misconoeiv~d and must fa.ii.\" Similar observations were made in the other case. If by these observations it is meant ts convey that - the protection under Art. 265 cannot be soug~t b.y 8: ~tition .under Art. 32, I entirely agree. But if it is meant to ·convey that a taxing law which is ·opposed to funda.mentaJ rights must be tested only under Art. 265, I find it difficult to agree. Artiole3 31 (1) and 265 speak of the same condition. A comparison of these two Articles shows this: Art. 31 (1)-:-\"No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" Art. 265-\"N o tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.\" The Chapter on Fundamenta;l, Rights hardly stands in need of support from Art. 265.

Stute of Uttar PradeJh H ida.Jaliollah J. 942 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1963) law is void under that Chapter, and property is seized to recover a tax which is void, I do not see why Art. 32 cannot be invoked. Where the authority of the law fails a tax, Art. 265 is offended, and the tax cannot be collected. A collection of such a tax will also offend Art. 32. Where the law is opposed to fundi.mental rights, and in the collec· tion of such a void tax, a person is deprived of his property, Art. 31(1) is offended. It ;s not possible to circumscribe Art. 32 by making the remedy only upon Art. 265. From this, it is clear that la.we whioh do not offend Pa.rt III and a.re not otherwise ultra vires are protected from any challenge whether under Art. 265 or under the Chapter on Fundamental Rights. Where the laws are ultra vires but do not per se offend fundamental rights (to distinguish the two kinds of defects), they are capable of a challenge under Art. 265, and the executive action, under Art. 32. Where they are intra vire8 other- wise but void being opposed to fundamental rights, they can be challenged under Art. 265 and also Art. a2. This position, however, changes radically when the law is valid but the action under it is challenged. The real difference in such calll'S arises, because the law is not challenged at a.II. What is challenged is the interpretation of the law by the taxing authorities, and · a breach of funda.· mental rights is said to arise from the wrong inter- pretation. In considering this matter, several kinds of cases must be noticed. Where the action of an officer of the l:\\tate is wholly without jurisdiction (as, for example, wheJl a sales tax officer imposes income-tax or vice versa, though such things are hardly likely to happen), it can have no sup- port from the law he purports· to apply. Cases of jurisdiction thus come within Art: 32. Other exam- ples are an attempt to recover a tax twice over, - $ml. Ujjant Bai •• Stak oJ Uttar h d·1h Hidayolul/all J. 944 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (196:J] limits. That exception also bears upon j11risdiction, where by a misconstmcticm the State Officer or a quasi-judicial trib11nal embarks upon an action wholly outside the pale of the law he is enforcing. If, in those circ11mstances, his accion oonstitutes a breach of fondamental rights, than a petition undt>r Art. 32 may lie. The cases of this Court in whioh interference can be sustained on this ground are many; but as examples may be seen the follow~~: Amar Singh, case (1) and Mohan/,al Hargwind 8 case('}. The firs\\ is not a. case of a ~ing statute, but the second is. - The decision in Kailas Nat,h,'s case ('), with respect, appears to have u11duly widened the last narrow approach by including cases of interpretation of provisions of law where the error is not appa.ren· tly one of jurisdiction a.s within Art. 32. It cited as authority the case of Bengal Immunity. Company('), which does not bear out the wide proposition. The oa.se involved a.n interpretation of notification to find out whether an exemption applied to a. pa.rti· cula.r cMe or not, !Wld no question of want of juris- diction, a.s explained by me, a.rose there.

Whether taxing statutes whioh have the pro- tection of Art. z65 can be questioned under Arts. t 9(l)(fj and (g) is a subject, whioh need not be gone into in this case. I do not, therefore, expreu any opinion upon it. Hero, the several statutes and the notification are not. challenged as ultra llirea.

If there is an error, it can be corrected by resorting to appeals, revisions, references to the High Court and ultimately by appeal to this Court. This Court can' not ignore these remedies and embark upon an exa- mina.tion of the law and the interpretation placed by the authorities, when no question of jurisdiction is involved. To do so would be to convert the powers under Art. 32 into those of an appeal. In my opinion, the petition under Art. 32 il5 miscon- ceived in the circumstances of this case. I would, therefore, dismiss it with costs. As regards the application of the appeal, I am of opinion that the party was negligent in not prosecuting it. I would therefore, dismiss the applioatio:µ for restoration but without any order a.bout costs. AYYANG.U, J.,-l'bis bench has been constitu- . ted for deciding the following two questions set out at the conclusion of what might be termed the order .of reference (1) : Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires, open to challenge ~s .repugnant to Art. t9( l)(g) on the sole ground that it is based on a mis-cons- truction of a provision of the Act or of a notifica- tion issued thereunder? (2) Can the validity of r,uch an order be questioned in a. petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution? Though the matter was not discussed with any eJaborate.ness, both these questions were answered in the affi.rm~tive by this Court in Kailal1lmath v. The Stale of U.P.

Ujjom B• i Y; Sf1.l1 of Uttar Prad-\"slt 946 SUPREME OOURT REPORTS (1963] coneidering the correctness of the decision on these points in Kai,lashna.th's case. Before proceeding to consider the submiasiOI\\S of learned Counsel on either side it is necessary to point out two matters; (I) It was agreed before us that in deciding the first question set out above we need not consi- der the special features applicable to taxing legis- lation and in particular the point a.s to whether the constitutional validity of such legislation could be tested with reference to the criteria. laid down by Art. 19(1 )(f); in other words, the limits to which Art. 19 would be attracted to a. law imposing 'a tax. The disou~sion in this judgment therefore proceeds on the ba.slS of there being no distinction between a law imposing a tax and other laws. (2) · Th.e second matter which I consider it necessary to state a.t the outset is that notwithstan- ding the industry of Counsel which has enabled them top lace before us quite a. large number of decisions of this Court which have been referroo to in the judgments of Kapur and Subba Rao, JJ., in none of them was the point approached with refe- rence to the matters argued before us. Some of these decisions proceed on the basis that in the circumstances stated in question No. 1 a funda- mental right had been invaded and on that basis afforded to the petitioner before them the relief sought. Other decisions state that no fundamental right was involved in the grievance put forward by the petitioners before them and relief has been refused on that basis. In none of them was the question discussed on principle as to when a.lone a. fundamental right would be invaded and in par- ticular as to whether a breach by a. quasi-judicial authority of the provisions of a law which is other- wise valid, could involve an invasion of a. funda- mental right. For this reason I propose to discuss I ' 1 s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 947 the question on prinoiple a.nd without reference to the decisions which· were placed before UB at the hearing. I feel forth.er justified in doing so because they have all been referred to in the judgment of Kapur, J., and di~cussed in detail by Subba 1-t:w, J. I shall now proceed to consider what in my view should be the answer to the first of the ques- tions propounded for our deoision and am ignoring the ref~rence therein to a taxing enactment. Pa~.1- sing here it might be useful to recall briefly the function of Part III in the Constitution. The rule of British Constitutional Law and in general of tho Dominion Con1Jtitutions framed by the British Par- . liament might broadly · be stated to be that it asserts the sovereignty of the Legislature in the sense that witliin the sphere of its . activity in the ca~e of a Federal Constitution a.nd in every sphere in the case of a unitary one its will was supreme and was the law of the land which the Courts were bound to administer. As Dicey has pointed out, there are no legal limits to the sovereignty of Parliament. Public opinion, as well as the fear engendered by the possibility of a popular revolt, might impose praotfoal restraints upon the exercise of sovereignty but so would be the limitations or restraints dictated by good sense, justice or a sense of fairplay. But so far as the Jega.l position wa.s concerned, any law made by Parliament was legal and could be enforced. Our Constitution makers did not conitider that to the conditions of this coun- try such a vesting ·of power in the legislatures or in the State would be proper or just or calculated to further the liberty of the individual which they considered was essential for democratic progress. It was in these circumstances and with these ideas that they imposed fetterson ~tat\"e action in Part III, entitled \"Fundamental Rights',. Article 13 laid down'. . that \"every law· whether made before or after the Constitution which was inconsistent with 1962 Smt. Ujj11m B·1i .. St11te <J' Ut•ar P1ad11h .Ay_~angar J. 1•6Z - Smt. Ujjam Dai v. Stalt nf UttfJr Pradesh 948 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] the rights guarauteed by the succeeding Articles should, save a.a otherwise expressly provided, be invalid to the extent of the repugna.ncy\". And \"law\" was defined in a comprehensive manner so as to include not merely laws made by Parliament or the legislatures but every piece of subsidiary legis· Jation including even notifications. The scheme theref.1re of the Constitution makers was to pres- cribe a code of conduct. to which State action ought to conform if it should pass the test of constitutio· nality. The rights included in the eighteen Arti- cles, starting from 14 up to 31, comprehend provi- sions for ensuring guarantees against any State action for protecting the right to life, liberty, and property, to trade and occupation, besides including the right to freedom of thought, belief and worship. The general scheme of Part III may be stated thus: Certain of the freedoms are absolute, i.e., subject to on limitations, e.g., Art. 17, Art. 20(1). In respect of certain others the Articles ( vide Art. 19) set out the precise freedom guaranteed as well as its content and the qualifications to which the ex- ercise of that freedom might be subjected by enac- ted law or action taken ·under such law. Having thus enuJilerated these freedoms and laid down the limitations, if any to which they could be subjected Art. 32 vests in the Supreme Court the authority and jurisdiction to ensure th~t the fundamental rights granted by Part III are not violated, and even the right to move this Court for appropriate relief for infraction of a fundamental right is itself made a fundamental right which ordinary legislation may not affect. The purpose of my drawing atten- tion to these features is two fold: ( 1) to emphasize the great value which the Constitution-makers attached to the :(reedoms guaranteed .as the sine qua non of progress and the need which they con- sidered for marking out a field which was immune from State action, and (2) the function of this / . ,. ' I I \\ I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 949 Court as a guardian of those righ~s for the mainte- nance of individual liberty enshrined in the Con- stitution. It was with advertance to this aspect of the matter that this Court observed in Daryao v. The State of U. P. ( 1): \"There can be no doubt that the funda- mental right guaranteed by Art. 3~(1) is a very impprtant safeguard for the proteotion of ·the fundamental rights of the citizens, and as a result of the said guarantee this Court ha.s been entrusted with the solemn task of upholding the fundament~l rights of the citizens of this country. The fundamental rights are intended not only to protect indivi- dual's rights but they are based-on high public policy. Liberty of the individual and t.he protection of his fundamental rights are t.he very essence of the democratic way of life adopted by the Constitution, and it is the privilege and the duty of this court to uphold those , rights. This Court would naturally refuse to circumscribe them or to curtail them exoept as provided by the Constitution Itself. It iS because of this aspect of the matter that in Ramesh Thr;ippar v. The State of Madras, ( 1950 S. · C.\" R. 594) in the very first year after the Constitution came into force, this Court rejec~ed a preliminary objection raised against the competence· of a petition filed under Art. 32 on the ground that as matter of orderly procedure the petitioner should first have resorted to the High Court under Art. 226, and observed that 'this Courtis thus constituted the protector and guarantor of the fundamental rights, and it cannot, consisten- tly With the responsibility BO }aid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seekio~ pro- tection against infringements of such rights'.

The reason for this concession must obviously be that the authority functioning under / such a law could have no legal basis for its existe- nce .and therefore his or its action would be with- out authority of Jaw. (2) The legislature may profess to legislate under a specified head of legis- lative power which it has, but might in reality be seeking to achieve indirectly what it could not do i • • ' \\ ~) - 1 s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 951 directly. In such a case also it was conceded that the tax imposed would infringe the guarantee etn.lndied in Art.l9(l}(f) and (g). It wo11ld, however, be seen that this is in reality merely one manner in which there might be lack of legislative power already dea.lt with under head (U, (3) The same. result would follow and there would be a breach of a. fundamental right ~f though there was legislative competence to enact the legislation in the sense that the subject-matter of the law fell within one of the entries of the Legislative List, appropriate to that legislature, but the legislation was invalid as viola.t, ing other fundctmen~al rights of a general nature applicable to all legislation, such as the violation of Art. 14, ~to. (4) Evenin cases where the enactment is valid judged by the tests in I to 3 above, if on a proper construction of the enactment; the 'quasi- judicial authority created to function under the Act and to administer its provisions, acted entirely out.- side the jurisdiction conferred on him or it by the ena.otment, such action, if violative of the funda- mental rights, could be complained of by a petition under Art. 32 and this Court would be both compe- tent and under a- duty to afford relief under that Article. Here· again, the ratio on which the conces- sion is based is similar to, though not identical with .the basis upon which the concession as regards action under invalid legislation was made. (5) Whe~e even if the officer or authority h&.d jurisdiction, still if he ha.tJ adopted a procedure contrary to either the m..t.nrlatory provisions of the statute or to the prinoipl..i~ of natural justice, the resulting order and the imposition of liability effected thereby were conceded to involve a breach of the fundamental right. These exceptions having been conceded by learned Counsel for the respondent, it is sufficient if attention is confined to the question, whether a patently incorrect order passed on a misconstruction 1961 Smt. Ujjam B11·i v. Statt of Uit1r Prade11h Avang~r J. 1962 Smt U jjam Bai , .. Stale of Uttar P1adesla 952 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1963) of a charging enactment would or would no.t result in the violation of a fundamental right and is that the very narrow question which this bench is called upon to answer. The argument of the learned Attorney-General who appeared for the petitioner, was short and simple. His submission rested on the correctness of the following steps: (1) The Constitution has vested in this Court the power to ensure, when approached by a petition under Art. 32, that fundamental righis w.ere not violated and accordingly there is a corumtutional duty cast upon the Court to afford relief when so approached in every case where fundamental riglita were violated. {2) The two matters which a petitioner 81eek· ing relief under Art. 32 of the Constitution would have to establish would therefore be: (a) the exilltie- nce in him of the fundamental right which he com- plains has been infringed, and ( b) ita violation by State action. If these two conditions are satiefied the petitioner is en titled as of right to the grallt of relief and the Court would be under a duty $0 afford him that relief by passir>~ appropriate orders or directions which would be necessary to ensure 'he maintenance of his fundamental right. (3) There was no dispute that a fundamental right could be invaded by State action which was legislative in character, or where the complaint was as regards the action of executi.-e and administra- r tive authorities created even under. valid statutes. (4) If the above premises which were not in dispute were granted, the next step was whether the decision of a qulM!i.judicial authority constituted under a valid law could violate a guaranteed free- dom. A quasi-judicial authority he urged is as much ----t I 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 953 part of the machinery of the S-tate as executive and administrative authorities, and its decisions and orders are as much State action and if the function of Part III of the Constitution is to protect the citizen against improper State action, the protection should logically extend to the infraction of right.a effected by such orders of quasi-judicial authorities. The short question for decision may in the circumstances be formulated thus: Can an action of a quasi-judicial authority functioning under a valid enactment and· not overstepping the limits of its jurisdiction imposed by the Act and not violating the procedure required by the principles of natural justice but whose decision is patently erronepus and wholly unjustified on any proper interpretation of the relevant provision, be complained of as violative of the fundamental ri~hts of a party prejudicially affected by such mis-interpretation. T~king the handy illustration of a taxing statute, if by a plain misinterpretation of the charging•provi· sion, an assessing-authority levies a tax on transac- tion A while the statute on its only possible con- struction imposes no ta~ on such a transaction, is any fundamental right of the party who is subjected to such an improper levy prejudicially affected by such an imposition ? · In considering the proper answer to this ques- tion it is necessary to exclude one matter which is a.pt to cloud the issue and it is this. The statute under which the quasi-judicial authority functions or makes the decision or order may contain provi- sions for enabling the correctness of the decision reached or the order passed being challenged by an appeal or may provide for a gradation of appeals and further revisions. The existence of procedures for redressing ~ri<'vances or correcting errors of primary or appellate authorities is obviously wholJy irrelevant for a. consirleration of the question as to whether the order of the authority' involves an Bmt. Ujjam Be v. 81u of UUar /'radish 1962 Sml. Ujjam Bai .. Stall of UUar Prad.sh Ayyangor J. 954 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] infringement of fundamental rights or not. This Court bas laid down in a large number of cases of which it is sufficient to refer to: Union of India v . T. R. Varma (1), The Stat,e of UUar Pradesh v. Mohammad Nooh ('), and A. V. Venkateswaran, Oolle,ctor of Customs, Bombay v. Ramchand Sobharj Wadhwani (') that the existence of an alternative remedy is no legal bar to the exercise of the jurisdic- tion of the High Court 'under Art. 226 of the Con- stitution. If that is so in the case of the jurisdiction under Art. 226 it must a fortiori be so in th9 case of a guaranteed remedy such as is vested in this Court under Art. 32 of the Constitution. Besides it cannot be predicated that there is a violation of a fundamental right if the party aggrieved has no appeal provided by the statute under which the authority acts, but that if other statutory remedies are provided there would be no violation of a funda- mental right, for the question whether a funda- mental right is violated or not is depenflent on the action complained of having an impact on a guaranteed right, and its existence or non-existence or the action constituting a breach of a fundamental right cannot be determined by the absence or presence of procedures prescribed by the statute for correcting erroneous orders. The absence of any provision for redress by way of appeal may have a bearing on the reasonableness of the law, bnt it has none on the point now under discussion. Besides, it cannot be that if the remedies open under the statute are exhausted and the authority vested with the ultimate authority under the statute has made its decision and there is no longer any poBBibility of an objection on the score of an alternative remedy being available, there wouLl. be a violation of a fundamental right with the consequence that this Court would have jurisdiction, but that if it was (I) [195q) S.C.R. 499. (2) [1958) S.C.R. ~95. (3) [1962] I S.C.R. 753. ; ~. .. ' \\. i s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 955 approaohed at an earlier stage there was no viola- tion of a fundamental right and that it lacks jurisdic- tion to afford relief under Art. 32, for. it must be admitted that in ultimate analysis there is no distinction between the nature and quality of an order passed by an original ae distinct from one by an appellate or revisional authority-in its conse- quences vis-a-vis the fundamental right of the individual affected. It is common ground and that is a matter which has already been emphasized that if a petitioner ma.de out to the satisfaction of the Court that he has a fundamental right in respect of the subject-matter and that the same has been violated by State action, it is imperative on the Court to afford reJief to the petitioner the Court not having any discretion in the matter in those circum- stances. On this basis the only ground upon which the jurisdiction could be denied would be that the order or decision of the authority which is impugn- ed does not prfljudiciaUy affect the fundamental right of the petitioner, for it cannot be that the order of the ultimate authority under the statute could involve the violation of a fundamental right but that the same orders passed by authorities lower down in the rung u'1der the statute would not involve such a violation. Pausing here, one further matter might a]so be mentioned for being put aside. This Court has laid down that the principal underlying the rule of res judicata is based on principles of law of general application and as such would govern also the right to reli6f under Art. 32. That principle is not involved in the consideration of the point under discussion, beca.m~e w~at is sought to be challenged as viola.ting a fundamental right is the very order of the authority and we are not concerned with a collateral attack on an order that had become final as between the parties thereto. 1962 Smt. Ujjam Bili v. /Jtce ofUllar Proauh 1161 Sml. Ujj .. Soi y. Blah •I Un; Produli -- 956 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] Coming back to the point under consideration it was conceded by the learned Additional Solicitor· General who. appeared for the respondent that legislative action might involve an infraction of fundamental rights and that similarly the action of the executive-authorities might involve such an infraction even when the legislation under which they acted or purported to act was within legisla- tive competence and within the constitutional limitation& imposed by Part III. His contention, however, was that a very different state of circum· stances arose when the action complained of 'was by a quasi-judicial authority. His submission may be summarised in the following terms:-Where a stat ute was within legislative competence and dOtlll not by its provisions violate any of the constitu- tional guarantees in Part III, it follows as a matter of law that every order of a quasi-judicial authority vested with power under the Act is also valid and constitutional and that the legality and constitutionality of the statute would cover every act or order of such an authority if the same was within his or its jurisdiction and prevent them from the challenge of unconstitutionality. The same argument was presented in a slightly different form by saying that such a quasi-judicial authority has as much jurisdiction to decide rightly as to decide wrongly and that if there was error in suoh a deci- sion the only remedy of the citizen affected was by resort to the tribunals set up by the Act for rectify- ing such errors and that in the last resort, that is after the entire machinery under the Act was exhausted, the affected party had a right to approach the High Courts under Art. 226 in oases where the error was of a type which could be brought within the scope of the remedial-writs provided by that Article. Before examining the correctne1111 of this submission it is necessary to mention that Mr. Chari , ' ' I I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 957 who appeared for some interveners supporting the Respondent, made a submission which if accepted would have far-reaching consequences. His conten- tion was that the State in Part III against whose action the fundamental rights were guaranteed was confined to the legislative and the executive branches of State activity and that the exercise of the judicial power of the State wou)d never contravene the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III. It would be seen that this is wholly different from the submission made on behalf of Government by the learned Additional Solicitor-General and it would be convenient to deal with this larger question after disposing of the arguments of Mr. Sanyal. The question for consideration is what exactly is meant when it is said that a statute is valid in the sense of: (a) being legally competent to the legislature to enact, and (b) being constitutional a.s not -..iolative of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III. It is obvious that it can only mean that the statute properly construed is not legally incompet- ent or constitutionally in valid. In this connection it is of advantage to refer to a point made by Mr. Palkhivala who appeared for some of the interve- ners in support of the petition. One of his submiss- ions was this: Suppose there is an Act for the levy of sales-tax which is constitutionally valid. On its proper construction it does not purport to or authorise the imposition of a tax on a sale \"in the course of export or import.\" If it did so expressly authorise, it is obvious that such a provision in the enactment would be ultra i-ires and unconstitutional as violative of the prohibition contained in Art. 286 (1) (a). Suppose flJ.rther that an authority function- ing under such an enactment vested with jurisdic- tion to assess dealers to sales tax proceeds to levy a tax and includes in the computation of the assessa- ble turnover not merely those items which are properly within the legislative competence of the 1962 Smt. Ujjam Bai v. State of Uttar Pradeth Ayyangar J. IHI Smt. Ujjam B•i v. 81°\" of U<tar P,.d.shJ 958 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] State Legislature to tax under the head 'Taxes on the sale of goods' but also the turnover in respect of transactions which are plainly \"sales in the course of export or import\" and this it does on a patent misconstruction of the statute, could it be Raid that the fundamental right of the dealer guaranteed by Art. 19 (I) (f) and (g) was not violated by the imposition of the sales tax in such circumstances? The logic behind this argument might be stated thus: If the legislature had in terms authorised the imposition of sales tax on such a transaction it would have been plainly void and illegal and hence ex-concessis the fundamental right in respect of property as well as of business under Art. 19 (1) (f) and (g) would be violated by the levy of the tax and its collection. How is the position improved if without even the legislature saving so in express terms an officer who purports to act under the statute himself interprets the charging provision so as to bring to tax a transac- tion which it was constitutionally incompetent for the legislature itself to tax. I find the logic in this reasoning impossible to controvert, nor did the learned Additional Solicitor-General attempt any answer to this argument. It appears to be manifest that the fact that an enactment is legislatively competent and on its proper construction constitutionally valid, i. e., it does not contain provisions obnoxious to Pa.rt III of the Constitution, does not ipso jure immunise the actions of quasi-judicial authorities set up nnder the statute from constituting an invasion of a fundamental right. What the legislature could not in express terms enact, could not obviously be achieved by the State vesting power in an authority created by it to so interpret the enactment as to contravene the Constitution. It might be suggested that such a case would fall within the exception which it is conceded r \"\\ . ./ - 1 s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 959 exists that an a.ct of a quasi-judicial authority which is plainly beyond its jurisdiction could give rise to the violation of a fundamental right in regard to which this Court might afford relief if moved under Art. 32. In my opinion, this is not quite a satisfying answer because the suggestion is coupled with the assertion of the well- wom dictum as regards thb jurisdiction of the tribunal to decide wrongly as much as rightly. The illustration I have given of tmconsitutional action by authorities acting under valid and constitutional enactments cannot be properly answered unless it be held that a plain and patent mis-interpretation of the provisions of the enactment could it self give rise to a plea that it was beyond the jurisdiction of the authority but that ,would be stretching the concept of jurisdictional errors beyond what is commonly understood by that term. Let me next take a case where the mis-interp- retation by the quasi-judicial authority does not involve the levy of a duty beyond the competence of the legislature enacting the statute. In the type of case now under consideration the quasi-judicial authority by a plain misinterpretation of, let us say, the charging provision of a taxing enactment (as that furnishes a handy illustration of the point now under discussion) levies a tax on a transaction which, under the Constitution, it was competent for the legislature to levy if it had been so minded. In other words, there a.re two related transaction or taxable events-A & B. The taxing-statute has selected the transaction or taxable event A and has imposed a tax upon it, and it alone. The authority vested with jurisdiction under the Act, however, by a patent mi&oonstruotion of the enactment considers that not merely the transaction or taxable event A but also the related transaction or taxable event B is within t!ie charging provision and levies a ta.x: thereon and proceeds to realise it. The problem 196S Sme. UjJom Br;i v. Seate oj Utfar Pr.duh 196t Smt. Ujjom Bal v. Stal1 of Utt.r Prudish ~ya1;gar J. 960 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] now under consideration is, could or could it not be said that in such a case the fundamental right of a citizen who has been wrongly assessed to tax in respect of the transaction or taxable event J3 which ex-concessis was not intended to be taxed under the enactment has been violated. With the greatest respect to those who entertain a contrary view I consid~r that the question can be answered only in one way and that in favour of holding that the fundamental right of the citizen is prejudicially affected. When once it is conceded that a citizen cannot be deprived of his property or be restricted in respect of the enjoyment of his property save by authority of law, it appears to me to be plain that in the illustration above there is no statutory authority behind the tax liability imposed upon him by the assessing authority.. The Act which imposed the tax and created the machinery for its assessment, levy and collection is, no doubt, perfectly valid but by reason of this circumstance it does not follow that the deprivation of property occasioned by the collection of a tax which is not imposed by the charging section doe~ not involve the violation of a fundamental right merely because the imposition was by reason of an order of an authority created by the statut3, though by a patent mis-interpretation of the terms of the Act and by wrongly reaching the conclusion that such a trnnsaction was taxable. I consider that the four concessions made by the respondent which I have set out earlier, all proceed on the basis that in these oases there is no valid legislative backing for the action of the autho- rity-executive, administrative or quasi-judicial. I consider that the reason of that rule would equally apply to oases where the quasi-judicial authority commits a patent error in construing the enact- ment-for in such a case also there would obviously be no legislative backing for the action resulting from his erroneous decision. ' ' ' . l S.C.R. SUPREME OOURT REPORTS 961 There is however one matter to which it is necessary to advert to avoid misconception, and that concerns the effect of findings reached on ques- tions of fact by quasi-judicial au~horities. Provided there is relevant evidence on which the finding could rest, the finding would preclude any violation of a fundamental right because this Court, though in the absence of a. finding of a duly constituted authority would have the power and jurisdiction to investi- gate even disputed facts in an appropriate case; would however accept findings of fact by duly con- stituted authorities and proceed to find out whether on that basis a fundamental right exists and is pre- judicially affected by the action impugned. The distinction which I would, in this context, draw a.nd emphasise is between a mis-interpretation of a statute by which an authority brings within the scope of an enactment transactions or activities not within it on any possible construction of its terms, and erroneous findings on facts by reason of which the authority considers a transa.ction as being within the Act even if properly construed. To sum up the position: (I) If a statute is legally~nacted in the sense of being within legisla- tive competence of the relevant legislature and is constitutional as not violating any fundamental rights, it does not automatically follow that any action taken by quasi 4 judicial authorities created under it cannot violate fundamental rights guaran 4 t9'3cl by Part III of the Constitution. The legislative competence, the existence of which renders the enactment valid,.. is confined to action by the autho- rities created under it, which on its proper cons- truction could be taken. In an authority constitu- ted u4der such a legal and valid enactment over 4 steps the constitutional limitations on .the legisl~ tive power of the State Legislature, the acts of such an authority would be plainly unconstitutional and the consequenoea a.rising out of unconstitutional 1968 Smt. Ujjam Ba v. State of Uttar Pr1desh 1962 Sml. Ujjnn Bo •• S1at1 of Ulla1 l:'radnh Ayycngar J. 96'.l SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1963 State action would necessarily attach to such action. If an \"unconstitutional Act\" of the Mate Legisla- ture would invade fundamental rights the same character and the same consequence must a fortiori follow when that act is not even by the i:1tate Legis- lature but by an authority constituted under an enactment passed by it. (2) Where State aotion without legislative sanction behind it would violate the rights guaranteed under Part III, the result can- not be different because the State acts through the mechanism of a quasi-judicial authority which is vested with jurisdiction to interpret the enactment. The absence of legislative sanction for the imposi- tion of an obligation or the creation of a liability cannot be filled in by the misinterpretation by an authority created under the Act. To hol;l that a patently increased interpretation of a statute by a quasi-judicial authority by which a liability is imposed on a citizen does not violate his fundamental rights under Arts. 19( 1 )(f) and (g) might not have done consequences but for two circumstances. The first is as regards the difficulty of designating with certainty an authority as quasi- judicial. The fact is that there is no hard and fast formula for determining when an authority which is vested with power to act on behalf of the State falls within category which is termed 'quasi-judicial'. As Prof. J:lobson stated; \"Lawyers, of course, have often had to decide, in practical cases arising jn the courts, whether a particular activity was of a judi- cial or an administrative (or 'ministerial') character; and important consequences have flowed from their decisions. But those decisions disclose no coherent principle, and the reported cases throw no light on the question from the wider point of view ........... . save to demonstrate, by the very confusion of thought which they present, the difficulty of arriving at a clear basis of distinction\". The significance of this point stems from the fact that it is a matter of 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 963 concession that where the power of the State is ves- ted in an executive or administrative authority under an enactment which is valid and constitu- tional and such an authority does an act which on the proper construction of the relevant statute is not justified by it, the act may be of such a character as to violate a fundamental right guaranteed by Part III, i.e., if the impact is in a field which is pro- tected from State interference, and such a violation could be complained of by a petition to this Court under Art. 32. At the same time it is the contention of the respondent that a similar act, order or deci- sion by a quasi-judicial functionary which is not warranted by the terms of the statute, does not give rise to the violation of fundamental rights. It is therefore necessary to examine somewhat closely the dividing liue between an execut,ive authority whose actions may give rise to the viola.- tion of a fundamental right and what is termed a «quasi-judicial\" authority whose actions do not have that effect. To start with, it is obvious that the nature of the act or of the order might be the same, so that if the same act proceeded from one autho- rity it would have a particular effect but would have quite a different effect or would not have tha.t effect if the same act proceeded from a slightly different type of authority also exercising the power of the State. This Court in Express Newspapers (Private) Ltd. v. The Union of India ( 1 ) quoted with approval the following statement of the law as sum- marised in Halsbury's Law of .h;ngland (3rd Ed., \"\" Vol. 2 at pp. 53-56): · \" ..................

A body may be under a duty, however, to act judicially although there is no form of !is inter partes before it .....•...... \" and in a further passage from the decision in R. v. .JJJ anchester Legal Aid Committee (1) which this Court extracted it was observed: \"The true view, as it seems to us, is that the duty to act judicially may arise in widely different circumstances which it would be im- possible, and, indeed, inadvisable, to attempt to define exhaustively.\" The question therefore whether an authoritiy crea- ted under a statute is a quasi-judicial authority or, in other words, an authority which is bound to act judicially cannot be laid down by any hard and fast rule but must be gathered from the entire provisions of the Act read with the purpose for which the power is vested in the authority as well as the grounds for the creation of such authority. I must however confess that this is a. branch of law in which authorities far from shedding light are in reality unhelpful-for one gets nowhere if these lay down as they do. that an authority would be quasi- judicial, if (not being a court) it is bound to act judicially and that to find out when, apart from clear provisions in the statute, it is bound to act judicially-you are told that it is when it is a quasi- judicial authority. Bearing in mind these. circum- stances I find it not possible to accept the conten- tion that if the power of the State be exercised by ' an authority which on a conspectus of the statute is deemed to be quasi-judicial and the exercise of such power prejudicially affects rights of life, liberty or property which are guaranteed by Part III the same cannot amount to a violation of a fundamen- tal right, whereas if on a proper construction of the (I) [1952] 2 Q.B. 413. \\ 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 965 statute that authority were a mere administrative body but the a.ot remains the same, it would so involve. Let me next see whether there oould be any rational or reasonable basis on which such a con- tention could rest. I take it that the reason why quasi-judicial authorities are suggested as being ex- ceptions to the general rule that State action which involves a prejudicial r~sult on a person's right to property etc. involves a violation of funda- mental rights is that a quasi-judicial authority is vested With the jurisdiction to dec·Ule and that the conferment of such a jurisdiction carries with it by necessary implication a right to decide rightly as well as wrongly; in other words, that it does not outstep the limits of the jurisdiction by a decision which is erroneous. I consider that it is the case of the transference of a principal to a branch of law or a situation in which it has no place or rele- vance. The question for consideration in the context of a petition under Art. 32 is whether there is valid legal sanction behind the action of the authority, for apart from such a sanction it must be and it is conceded that there would be a violation of a fundamental right. Besides, if this proposition is right, then it must rest on the principal that the quasi-judicial authority is vested with the right to decide. Does it, however, follow that executive action does not in vole a decision or posit a right to decide? If it is clear Jaw, as must be conced~d, that there is no necessity to have a lis in order to render the body or authority deciding a matter to be treated as a quasi-judicial authority, then it is very difficult to conceive of few actions by the *'xecutive which do not involve an element of discretion. No doubt in the case of an adminis- trative or executive body the decision is not preceded by a hearing involved in the maxim Audi Alteram Partem but this, in my opinion of the 1961 Sml. Ujjam B1 \"· Slat1 of Uita Protin/a .4panga• J. 1961 Sml. Uj;om B•r •• State of Uu•r Prmk•h A.yyangar J. 966 SUPREME COURT RE.PORTS (1963) merely the procedure before the decision is reached and is not the essence of the distinction. Besid.,s, as pointed out by Prof. Robson in 'Justice and Administrative Law' (a), \"Sometimes the administrative and judicial functions of an office have been so inextrica- bly blended that it is well-night impossible to say which ca.pa.city is the dominant one.\" In this state of affairs to determine the maintaina- bility of a petition under Art. 32 by proceeding on an investigation as to the nature of the authority which passed that order when, as I have pointed out earlier, there is no essential difference in either ' the nature or the quautum of th<i injury suffered by the citizen, cannot be sustained on any proper interpretation either of the Constitution or the principles of law governing the interpeta.tion of statutes. I would, therefore, hold that the free- doms guaranteed by Part III may be violated by the action ,,f a. quasi- judicial authority acting within the limits of its jurisdiction under a valid and constitutional statute where it plainly misinter- prets th3 provisions of the statute under which it functions or which it is created to administer. As regards the practical effect of accepting the contention of the learned Additional Solicitor Genera.I there is a second matter to which I consider it essential to draw attention. With a. very great increase in governmental activity and the diverse fields in which it operates owing to the State being a welfare State as contrasted with a Police-State concerned ma.inly with the maintenance of law and order, there bas necesMrily been a great prolifera- tion of governmental departments with the atten- dant creation of several authorities which have to pass decisions in spheres affecting the citi:r.en at manifold points. It is therefore true to say that in a modern welfare State administrative agencies 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 967 ,. exerc1smg quasi- judicial authority are vastly more numerous and if I may add, more important and more vital than even the normally constituted Courts. In such a situation to hold that funda- mental rights would not. be involved by the activi- ties of these various authorities which are increasing iu number day by day would, be, in my opinion, to .. deny to the citizen the guarantee of effective relief which Art. 32 was designed to ensure in the great majority of oases. In such a situation to assert at one breath the prime importance and significance of the function of this Court as a protector and guarantor of fundamental rights, and at the same time to hold that these numerous statutory authorities which are created to administer the law cannot invade those rights would be to render this assertion and this guarantee of relief mostly empty of meaning. Though. if the words of the Constitution were explicit, considerations such as there would be of no avail, yet even if' the matter were ambiguous I am clearly of the opinion that the rejection of the broad contention raised on behalf of the respondent .. is justified as needed to give effect to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution. But as I have pointed out already, on no logical basis couldjt be held that where an act or order of a quasi- judicial authority lacks legislative backing, it cannot still impinge on a person's fundamental right and where an order suffers from patent error, it is no legislative sanction behind it. It now remains to consider the point urged by Mr. Chari that 'State\" action which involves the violation of a fundamental right does not include that resulting from what be termed \"the judicial authority of the State\". The argument put forward in support of this proposition was rested in most part, if not wholly, on the terms of Art. 12 of the .. Constitution and the definition of the expression \"State\" contained in it. Article 12 enacts: 190! Smt, Ujjam Bai •• Stat. of U ttar Pradesh ~)yongar J. 1961 Smt. U}jam Bai y, Slatt of Ultar Pradesh 968 SUPREME OOURT REPORTS (1963) \"In this part, unless the context other- wise requires, 'the State' includes the Govern- ment and Parliament of India and the Govern- ment and the Legislature of each of the i:itates and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.\" It was pointed out that the \"State\" whose action might involve the violation of fundamental rights or rather as against whom the citizen had been granted a guarantee of oertain rights under this Part was defined to include the \"Government\" and \"Parliament\" of the Union and of the 8tates, and the local authorities, did not name the \"Judicial power of the State\" as within it. If learned Counsel is right in this au bmission that the State in Part III impliedly excludes judicial and quasi-judicial autho- rities by reason of the absence of specific mention the further submission that by any of the actions of such authorities fundamental rights could not be violated would appear to be ma.de out and it has to be added that if this contention is right some of the concessions made by Mr. Sanyal would be unjus- tified. There are several considerations to which I shall immediately advert which conclusively nega- tive the correctness of the inference to be drawn from judicial and quasi-judicial authorities not being specifically named in Art. 12. ( 1) In the first placs, it has to be pointed out that the definition is only inclusive, which itself is apt to indfoate that besides the Government and the Legislature there might be other instrumentalities of State action which might be comprehended within the expres· sion \".:'tate\". That this expression \"includes\" is used jn this sense and not in that in which it is very occasionally nseJ as meaning \"means and includes\" eoulrl be gathered not merely from other provisions f .. { ., t S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 969 of Part III but·also from Art. 12 itself. Article 20(1) would admittedly refer to a limitation imposed upon the judicial power of the State and is obviously addresssed also, if not wholly, to judicial authori- ties. Mr. Chari however sought to get over the im- plication arising from Art. 20(1) by suggesting that the definition in Art. 12 which excluded judicial and quasi-judicial authorities from within the pur- view of the expression ''State\" sbould be under- stood as applying only subject to express provision to the contrary. I feel wholly unable to accept the method suggested of reconciling the presence of Art. 20(1) with the interpretation of Art. 12 as excluding judicial and quasi-judicial authorities. No doubt, the definition in Art. 12 starts with the words ''unless the context otherwise requires\", that expression however could serve to cut down even further the reach of the definition and cannot serve to expand it beyond the executive and legislative fields of State action if the word \"includes\" were understood as ''means and includes\" which is the contention urged by learned Counsel. Again, Art. 12 winds up the list of authorities falling with- in the 4efinition by referring to ''other authorities\" within the territory of India which cannot, obvio- usly be read as ejusdem generis with either the ·Government and the Legislatures or local authori- ties. The words are of wide amplitude and capable of comprehending every authority created under a statute and functioning within the territory of India. There ifl no characterisation of the nature of the \"authority\" in this residuary clause and con- sequently it must include every type of authority set up under a statute for the purpose of adminis· tering laws enacted by the Parliament or by the State including those vested with the duty to make decisions in order to implement those laws (2 ). Among the reliefs which on the terms of Art. 32 this Court might afford to persons approa- ching it complaining of the violation of the 1962 Smt. Ujjam Bai v. State of Uttar Pradesh Ayya11gat\" J. 1962 Sml. UJJam Biii v. Sllli,./ U11., Pr,,,,.sh -- 970 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1963] fundamental right is the issue of a writ of certior- ari specifically enumerated in that Article. It is common ground that that writ is available for issue only against judicial or quasi-judicial authori- ties and it would normally follow tha.t quasi.judicial authorities could equally with other instruments of Stat.e action violate fundamental rights which could be redressed by the issue of this type of writ. (3) The theory propounded by learned Counsel is based on what might be termed the rigid doctrine of the separation of powers which is not any fea- ture of our Constitution as has bean repeatedly laid down by this Court. (4) Even on the words of Art. 12 as they stand the construction suggested by learned Counsel has to be rejected. The article refers to the government (of Union and of the States) as within the definition of a \"State\". It is however admitted that both the Government of the Union as well aH of the State, function as quasi-judicial authorities under various statutory enactments. The question would at once arise whether when the \"government\" exercise such powers it is deemed to be a \"government\" falling within the definition of \"State\" or should be classi- fied as a judicial authority wielding 'the judicial power of the State\" so as to be outside the defini- tion, so that its decisions and orders do not give rise to a violation of a fundamental right. Article 12 on any reasonable construction cannot permit the dissection of \"government\" for the purpose of discovering the nature or the quality of the powers exercised by it, into the three fields of executive pure and simple, judicial and legislative for the purpose of a fresh reclaseifioa.tion into certain categories. When government exercises any power, be it executive pure and simple, or quasi-judicial under a statute or quasi-legislative in say framing subordinate legislation, it does so as \"government\" and no forther sub-division of it I 1 s.c.R, SUPREME OOURT REPORTS 971 is possible except for the purposes merely of aca- demic study or for determining the nature of the relief which might be had by persons affected by its activities in any particular field. Similarly, Parliament is vested with a quasi-judicial power to punish for contempt which itself is by reason of such power belnnging to the Parliament of the United Kingdom and this if anything is an indica- tion that the constitution does not recognise any doctrine of the separation of powers. In other words, the reference to the Government and the Legislature in the definition is a reference to them as institutions known by that name and is not with a view to describe their particular functions in the body politic. (5) That the reference to the Government and the Legislatures is to them as institutions and is not to be understood as a reference to thair functions. viz., to bodies performing executive and legislative functions is perhaps forcefully brought out by the inclusion of \"Local authorities'' in the definition of ''State\". It is obvious that municipal and local Board. authorities going under various descriptions in the several State would be comprehended within that term. Now municipal councils exercise, as is well known, legislative, executive as well as quasi· judicial functions. They frame Rules and bye-laws which ara subordinate legislation and would fall within the description of 11laws'' as defined by Art.13, Municipal Counci1s are vested with administra- tive functions and they also exercise quasi-judicial functions when assessing taxes, hearing taxation appeals, 1 o mention only a small fraction of the quasi-judicial power which they possess and exer- cise in the ·discharge of their functions as the local administration. H the ''local authority\" as a whole is a ''State\" within the definition there is no canon of construction by which any part of the .action of tha.j authority could be designated as not 1963 Smt Ujjam Bo • v. Stat1 of Ulla' Prad1fh AyyangarJ. 1962 Sml. UJj•m B•i •• S 1ok of Utta, Pradesh 972 SUPREME OOURT REPORTS [1963] falling within State action for the purpose of giving rise to violation of a fundamental right. (6) Them is only one other matter which need be referred to in this connection. Both this Court, as well as the High Court have vested in them the power to make rules, and it cannot be disputed that such rules would be \"laws\" within the definition of the ex- pression in Art. 13. If so, it is manifest that such rules might violate the fundamental rights, i.e., their validity would depend inter alia on their pass- ing the test of permissible legislation under Part III. This would directly contradict any argument that Courts and quasi-judicial authorities are out- side the definition of State in Art. 12. In the face of these deductions following from the Constitution itself, I find it wholly impossible to accede to the submission that what is termed as judicial power of the State which, it is submitted, would include quasi-judicial authorities created under statuteB do not fall within the definition of the \"State\" and that their actions therefore are not to be deemed \"State\" action against which the Constitution has provided the rights guaranteed under Part III. I would therefore answer the question referred to the Bench by saying that the action of quasi· judicial authority could violate a fundamental right if on a plain mis-construction of the statute or a patent misinterpretation of its provisions such an authority affects any rjghts guaranteed under Part III. This would be in addition to the three broad categories of cases in regard to which it was conceded that there could be a violation of funda- mental rights: (I) where the statute under which it functions was itself invalid or unconstittional, '(2) where the authority exceeds the jurisdiction con- ferred on it by the Act, and (3) where the authority though functioning under sta~ute, contravenes mandatory procedure prescribed in the statute or ( .. • 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 973 violates the principles of natural justice and passes an order or makes a direction affecting a person's rights of property etc. Before concluding it is necessary to advert to one matter which was just touched on in the course of the agruments as one which might be reserved for consideration when it actually arose, and this related to the question whether the decision or order of a regular ordinary Court of law as distin- guished from a tribunal or quasi-judicial authority constituted or created under particular statutes could be complained of as violating a fundamental right. It is a salutary principle that this Court should not pronounce on points which are not in- volved in the questions raised before it and that is the reason why I am not dealing with it in any ful- ness and am certainly not expressing any decided opinion on it. Without doing either however, I nonsider it proper to make these observations. There is not any substantial identity between a Court of law adjudicating on the rights of parties in the lis before it and designed as the High Courts and this Court are to investigate inter alia whether any fundamental rights are infringed and vested with power to protect them, and quasi-judicial authorities which are created under particular statutes and with a view to implement and ad- minister their provisions. I shall be content to leave the topic at this. This brings me to the question as to whether there has been a patent misinterpretation of the statute, as I have described earlier, and whether as a result the petitioner has established a violation of a fundamental right. ~ection 4(1) of the U.

Briefly stated, the contention urged on - behalf of the petitioner was that in the proviso to the notification dated December 14, 1957, the expres- sion have been pa.id on such goods\" applied only to those cases where an additional duty was pay- able and was framed to deny the benefit of the exemption to parties who being liable to _ pay such duty failed to pay the same. Where, however, no duty, was pa.ya.hie at all, no question of the levy of duty arose and the proviso was inapplicable. On the other hand, the Sales Tax Officer construed the notification with the aid of the proviso as meaning that the exemption from payment of. sales tax was granted only in those cases where an additional duty having become payable the ·same had been paid i. e. the State was intended to be deprived of the right to levy Sales tax only when it obtained some benefit from the additional excise duty which was distributed to it. The question that arises ii not whether the construction con- tended for by· the petitioner is. the oorrect or the preferable one; but whether ·that adopted by the &~es Ta.x Offioer was not one which it was possiblo for one reasonably to take of the provision.

Judged from the point of view I am inclined to hold that where it is possible reasonably to uphold the construction adopted by an inferior tribunal it would be a case of mere error of law and not a patent error, or an error apparent on the faoe of the record whioh should justify the issue of a writ of certiarari. In this view I would dismiss the writ petition. As regards the application to restore the appeal to the file, I do not consider that the request ought to be &llowed and for two reasons : Firstly, the applicant having voluntarily withdrawn the appeal I do not see any justification for accerlini; to his present request. Secondly, if as I have held, the error in the order of the officer was not such as to justify the issue of a writ of certiorari to quash the same the judgment of the High Court under Art. 226 was correct and the petitioner would not gain any advantage by the revival of the appeal. In the circumstances I would dismiss the petition for restoration of the appeal. MuDHOLKAR. J.-The question which a.rises for consideration in this petition under Art. 32( l) of the Constitution is whether a. right guaranteed by Part III such as a right to ea.rry on trade or business is breached because a. taxing authority, though acting under a. law which is inter virea and following a. procedure whioh is constitutionally as well as legally permissible has erroneously assessed and levied a. tax on a trade or business. Unless we hold that an erroneous assessment, be it due to misconstruction of law or misa.ppreciation of facts, constitutes an invasion of a. right guaranteed by Pa.rt III, the remedy pt'<lvided J>y Art. 32(1) will not be available, The • , 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 977 substance of the petitioner's contention is that when the constcuction placed: by a taxing authority upon a provision of law is wrong the levy of tax is one which is not authorised by law and ·thus the assessee's right under Art. 19(l)(g) of the Constitution is infringed. What had to be construed by the Sales Tax Officer in the case before us was not a statutory provision but a noti:tlcation issued by the Govern- ment of Uttar Pradesh on December 14, 1957 under s. 4(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Sales Ta.x Act, 1948 (U~P. Act XV of 1948). The aforesaid pro- vision' of the Sales Tax Act and the notification have been set out iii the judgments of some of my learned brethren and need not be set out over again. in this judgment. Upon the construction placed by him on this notification the Sales Tax Officer held the petitioner liable to pay sales tax on the turnover of sales of l>idis for the period between April l, 1958 and June 20, 1958. The petitioner's contention before the Sales Tax Officer wa.a that bidis were exempted from sales tax by the notifi- cation in question. The plea was negatived by the Sales '.fax Officer. ThEI petitioner having unsuc- cessfu.lly challenged the assessment before the sales . t~x authorities moved the High Court of Allahabad under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The petition was dismissed. Having failed them the petitioner sought and obtained a certificate from the High Court: to the effect that the case is fit for appeal before this Court. Thereafter the petitioner moved the present petition before this Court but took no steps to bring the appeal bef~re this Court. That appeal was thereupon dismissed for non-prosecution on February 20, 1961. I-may incidentally mention here that the petitioner has now applied for restoration of the appeal. But that has nothing to dO with the point whioh I have refen-ed to earlier. 1962 Smt. Ujjam Bai v. Sia:• of Utear Prad1sh Mudh•lkar J • ( 196! ~mt.

At the hearing reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioner on the deoision of this Court in Kaila8h Nath v. State of U.P.(1) in which by accepting an interpretation on a provision of the Sales Tax Act different from that put upon it by the sales tax autil.orities this Court held that the petitioner before it was being deprived of his pro- perty without the authority ofle.w. The correctness of the decision was challenged on behalf of the respondent State on the basis of various decisions, including some of this Court, and in view of the importance of the question involved the case was direoted to be placed before the Chief Justice for constituting a large Bench. In the referring Order the following two questions were formulated by the learned Judges who made the reference : (1) Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires, open to challenge as repugnant to Art. 111 ( 1 )(g) on the sole ground that it is bMed on a misconstruction of a provision of the Act or of a notification issued there- under? (2) Can the validity of such an order be questioned in petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution ? I have not discussed the decisions of this Court as they have been considered fully in the judgment& of my brethren but have approached the questions with reference to the principles of law applicable to the questions placed before us. The two questions are really one : •Can an erroneous order of assessment by a taxing autho· rity result in a breach of a right to carry on trade or busineBS so as to entitle the person complaining of the breach to approach this Court under Art. 32 ? The remedy provided by this Article-whicll is (I; A.1.R, 957 S.C. 790. , 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 979 itself a fundamental right-is restricted to the enforcement of fundamental rights and does not extend to other rights such as a. right to have a wrong order quashed. On the one hand it was contended at one stage, on the authority of the- decisions in Ramjilal v. Income-Tax Officer, Mohindargarh (') and Laxmanappa Hanumanwppa Jamkhandi v. The Union of lndw (2) that a funda- mental right will not be breached if the requirelQents of Art. 265 are satisfied, that is to say, the tax is assessed under authority of law. On the other hand it is said, in substance, that an erroneous order of a taxing authority is an unreasonable restreiction on a person's right to carry on trade or business and Art. 32 entitles that person to redress from this Court. It has, however, been made clear in sereval decisions of this Court that a law under Art. 265 must not violate a right guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution. [See Mohommm1 Yasin v.

If it violates any of the guaranteed rights, recourse to the provisions of Art. 32 is avail- able 1;o the aggrieved person. Fundamental rights enumerated in Art. 19(1) are, however, liable to be restricted by laws permis· sible under els. 2 to 6 and, therefore, we must first consider the Jimits within which a person can claim. to assert and exercise his fundamePtal right.

This right is further subject to the sovereign power of the State to levy a tax. For, the right to levy a tax is essential for the support of the State and in exercise thereof the State can impose a tax on a trade or business. Article 265 of the Constitu - tion provides that the imposition must be under the authority of a law. Further our Constitution being, broadly speaking, federal, the right to levy taxes has been divided between the Union and the States and the fields in which the Union and the States can respectively levy taxes have been demarcated in the lists contained in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. Despite the demarca- tion, each is supreme in its own field in the matter of levying taxes. There is yet another limitation on the power of the State to make laws including a law levying a tax and that is placed by cl. (2) of Art. 13 of the Constitution which runs thus : \"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contraven- tion of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.\" A pre-constitution law like the U. P. Sales Tax Act with which we are concerned here must also be consistent with Art. 13(1) which runs thus: \"All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far ae they are incon- 1 sistent with the provisions of this Fart, shall, to the extent of such in consistency, be void.\" Such a law or any provision thereof to the extent of its inconsistency with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution will be void. The law muat further not be violative of anv other. oonati~onal .. :- 1 S.O.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 981 provision as for example Art. 276(2), Art. 286, Art.'301 etc. The law must also have been enacted after complying with a.11 the requirements of the Constitution and where it is subordinate legislation, those of other relevant laws. If a. law imposing a tax is in contravention ~ of any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution the Jaw would be void and a person aggriev·ed would be entitled to move this Court under Art. 32 on the ground that one of his funda- mental rights has been infringed. Similarly, if a law is beyond the competence of the legislature whioh_!'nacted it or if it contravenes any provision of the Constitution such as Art. 276 or Art. 286 it would be an invalid law as being ultra vires the Constitution and the tax levied thereunder would also be one which is not authorised by law and the assessee can move this Court under Art. 32 on the ground t;hat his right under Art. 19( l)(g) is breached. Similarly, if a tax is levied by an authority not empowered by law to do so, or by a competent authority in violation of the procedure permitted by law or in violation of the principles of natural justice, ·the levy would be unauthorised and the decision under which it was made would be a nulli- ·ty. In such a case also the assessee can move this Uourt under Art. 32. All this is accepted before us on behalf of the State. But where a tax is levied by a competent. legislature, after due compliance with all the require. ments relating to the making of Jaws and when it • is subordinate le~islation, the requirements of other relevant laws, and is also not in violation of any provision of the Constitution it will operate as a reasonable restriction upon the right of a person to carry on liis trade, business etc. Though a person's right to oa.rry on a trade or business is a fundamental dght it is thus subject to the aforesaid limitations. The quantum of the right left to an individual to 1961 Smt. Ujjam Bai v.

(6) of Art. 19. His actual right would be to carry on business burdened with the aforesaid restriction. Where, as her!', the rest1iction is placed on a dealer and takes the form of a liabi- lity to pay a. tax on the t•1rnover of sales on certain commodities by him then he can carry on his trade subject to his liability to pay the tax as asses- 1ed from time to time. It is thi11 which is the nett content of his right to carry on trade, ignoring for the moment restrictions laid upon it by other com- petent laws made by the State. After a valid res- triction is placed upon a fundamental right what will be enforceable under Art. 32 would be not the unrestricted right but the restricted right. It was not disputed before us that where a quasi- judicial tribunal constituted under the Act whereunder a tax is levied, by an erroneous cons- truction of the Constitution or of th11.t Act holds the tax to be within the competence of the State legis- lature or ae not contravening a provision of the Constitution, its decision will still be deemed to affect a fundamental right of the person upon whom a tax is levied in pursuance of that decision. Thi& position was rightly not disputed before us because, in the premises, the Act would itself be void and consequently no legal liability can arise by virtue of the quasi-judicial tribunal constituted under it. A restriction imposed by a void law being illegal falls outside cl. (6) of Art. 19. • Now when a State wanta to impose a tax on , a trade or business it must necessarily provide for the machinery for assessing and collecting it The assessm~nt and collection of a tax cannot be arbitrary and, therefore, the State must confer upon the taxing authority the power and impose upon it the duty to act judicially. Absence of such a provision will make the law bad as being vlola.tive ' t 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 983 of Art. 19 (l)(g): K. P. Moopil Nair v. State of Keral.a (1). The Sales Tax Act in force in Utt&r Pra.desh is a law of this kind. It not only imposes a tax on the sale of certain commodities but also provides for the assessment of the tax as well as for .appeals, revisions etc., from the ordera of assessment. It is a law as contemplated by Art. 265 and it is not contended that any of its provisions infringe the petitioner under Art. 19(1) (g). Being an instrumentality of the State, like others charged with administrative duties, a taxing authority is not a court of law, as that expression is understood. All the same it has, in the discharge of its functiQns, to act judicially. Since, however, it is ~ tribunal of limited jurisdiction and since also it performs other functions which are adminis- trative in character it is not a purely judicial but only a quasi-judicial tribunal. The qualification ~quasi', however, would not make its duty to act judicially less imperative. In it! role as an assessing authority is if incumbent upon it io ascertain facts and apply- the taxing law to tho.se facts. It must apply its mind to the rele- vant provisions of the law and to the fa.eta of et .ch case and arrive at its findings. It is, therefore, inevitable that the authority should have the power to construe the facts as well as the laws. In other words, it must have jurisdiction to do those things or else its decisions can never have any value or binding force. A taxing authority which has the power to make a decision on matters falling within the purview of the law under which it is functioning is undoubtedly under an obligation to arrive. at a right decision. But the liability of a tribunal to err is an accepted phenomenon. The bindlng force (1) ( 1961) S S.O.R. 77. 1962 Sn.I. Ujjam /Jai •• Stote of Uttar Pr.desk Mudlrolkar .T. I Sml. Ujjam Bai v. Stat1 oj Uttar l'rod'-sh Mudhollrar J. 984 SUPREME ()OURT REPO:RT3 [1963] of a decision which is arrived at by a taxing authority acting within the limits of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by law cannot be marle dependent upon the question whether its decision is correct or erroneous. For, that would create an impossible situation. Therefore, though erroneous, its decision must bind the assessee. Further, if the taxing law is a valid restriction the liability to be bound by the decision of the taxing authority is a burden imposed upon a person's right to carry 0n trade or bminess. This burden is not lessened or lifted merely because the decision proceeds upon a misconstruction of a provision of the law which the taxing authority has to construe. Therefore, it makes no difference whether the decision is right or wrong so long as the error does not pertain to jurisdiction. The U. P. Act empowers the sales tax officer to make the assessment, to ascertain the necessary facts for holding whether or not a pnson is liable to pay tax and if he is liable, to determine the turnover of his sales. Since sales tax is imposed only on certain commodities and tax at different rates is since sales chargeable an different eommodities the power of the Sales Tax Officer to makes an assessment carries with it the power to determine whether the sales of particular commodities effected by the assessee fall within th\" ambit of the Act or not and if they do, to dete•mine tho rnte or ratl•S of tax chargeable in n'spPnt of sales of different commodities. In regard to all thAse matters he has to follow the procedure prescribed by the Act. If he finds upon a construction of the Act and of the rules and noti· fications issued thereunder that a certain oommo· dity is liable to pay a tax then so long as the transaction is one upon which the State legislature oould impose a tax and the commodi~y is one on which the State legielaturo could impose a tax it ia • • • t I S.O.R. SUPREME OOURT REPORTS 985 difficult to 15ee how the .decision arrived at by the Sa.lea Tax Officer can be said to be otherwise than within his jurisdiction even though he may have made an error in coming to a partioula.r conclusion. If he comes to a wrong conclusion would he, in demanding the tax on the basis of such concluion, be making an m;i.lawful dema.nd? The conclusion may be obviouslr or palpably wrong but so long as it is not sliown to be dishonest would his decision be void? Of course, if by placing an erroneous construction on the law he holds, say, that a. transaction which is bit by Art. 286 of the Constitution is one which oan be taken into consideration for the purposes of assessing the tax or if he bolds that a. commo- dity upon which the State legislature could not impose a. tax is taxable und~r the Act he would clearly· ha.ve acted beyond bis jurisdiction and his asse88ment with respect. to snoh a transaction or a commodity would be void. With respect to such a&sessment the a.ssessee will of course have the right to move this Court under Art. 32. But where suoh is not the case and the error of the Sa.lee Tax Officer lay only in holding that a tax is payable on a certain commodity, as in this case bidis, even though bidis may have been exempted from such tax by a notification made by the Government, how could he be sa.id to have acted without juris- diotion ? It· was, however, contended that where the er.roueous ·· construction by the Sales Tax Officer \\ results in the levy of a tax _for whioh there is no authority in law the fundamental right to carry on trade or business will necessarily be breached. The answer to this contention is th11t sinoe he ha.s the power to construe the law and decide whether a particular transaction or commodity is taxable his decision though erroneous must be regarded a.s one authorised by law and oonseqwmtly the tax 19G2 Smt.

For, what is authorised by law is that which the appropriate authority upon consideration and constr1rntion of the law holds to be within the law. It was said that the answer would take in even erroneous decisions as to commodities and transactions with respect to which the State legis· lature is incompetent to make laws. I have no doubt that it would not, because the power of the Sales Tax Officer to levy a tax cannot extend beyond that of the State legislature. The Sales Tax Officer functioning under the Act in question has, clearly, the power to summon witnesses, call documents, record evidence and so on. The Act imposes a duty on him to give an opportunity to the person sought to be asses~ed to be heard. His decision upon matters falling within the scope of the laws governing the proceedinits before him, unless revised or modified by a tribu· nal or authority or a court to which he is subordinate must, therefore, be regarded as having R.s much validity as that of a court of law in the exercise of its judicial power subject, of course, to the limitations stated earlier. The decision may be erroneous. It may proceed upon a blatant or obvious error on the face of the record. Even so, it cannot be regarded as 'non est' or void or a mere nullity. If that is the correct legal position, what difference would it make if as a result of an erroneous decision arrived at by a Sales Tax Officer resulting from a misconstruction of a notification under the Sales Tax Act, a person is held liable to pay tax· upon sales ofa commodity which, upon a proper construction, would appear to be exempted from tax by the law likP the notification in ques- tion? Just as a person cannot complain of a breach of his fundamental right to carry on trade or busi- ness because an erroneous decision of a court of law renders him liable to pay a sum cf money, so too • • • 1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPOR'rs 987 he ca.nnot complain · agaimt an eq11a.Uy erroneous decision of a-Sa.las Tat Officer. But that does riot mean that an erroneous decision can never be challenged before this Court. After exhausting the remedies provided by the taxing statute the aggrieved party can challenge it directly under Art. .136 or indirectly by first moving the High Court under Art. 226 · or 227 and then coming up in appeal &j!ainst the decision of the High Court. Though this Court is the guardian of b.11. fundamental rights the Constitution has not ta.ken away the right of the ordinary courts or of quasi· judicial tribunals administering a variety of laws to exercise their existing jurisdiction and to deter- mine matters falling within their purview. If by reason of the decision of a tribunal a person, for instance, ·loses his right to occupy a house, or has to pay a tax, that decision cannot be thrown to the winds and a complaint made to this Court that a fundamental right has been violated. The decision being one made in exercieie of _a judicial power and in performance of a duty to make it is a valid adjudication .though as a result of it a person may_ not be able to occupy his house or may have to pay a ta.x. The decision may be a right one or a wrong one. If it is not a nullity when. it is right I fail to see how it can_ be said to be a nullity l;>ecause it is erroneous,. so Jong of course, as the law is a good law, the deci!'Jion is of an authority competent to act under the law, the procedure followed by it is as prescribed by the law ~ and the error does not pertain to jurisdiction.- The error ma.y lie in the construction placed upon a. statue by the trib1,1na.l. If it is that and no more, such erroneous construction cannot render the action ta.ken thereunder arbitrary or unauthorised.

J. 988 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1963] 1962 corrected it would not be open to the party to say SmJ. Ujjom B.; that its fundamental right is violated. Mud/tolk(tr .. J. Looking at the matter from the aspect of the nature of the right which is capable of being enfor- ced under Art. 32 the same conclusion is reached. Thus when the provisions of a taxing law entitle a taxing authority to assess and levy a tax and for these purposes to decide certain matters judicially and give binding effect to its decision and none of the provisions of that law are void under ;\\rt. 13 or otherwise invalid the right enforceable under Art.32 woul<l be the right to carry on business subject to the payment of the tax as assessed by the taxing authority and not a right to carry on trade or busi- ness free from that liability. It makes ne differen- ce even if the assessment of the tax is based upon an erroneous construction of the taxing law inas· much as the right to have a.correct determination of the tax is not part of the fundamental right to carry on business but flows only from the taxing law. It would follow therefore that 'in such a case llothing is left for being enforced under Art. 32 when the taxing authority does no more than a88&as and levy a tax after determining jt. One more point needs to be dealt with. It was said that a quasi-judicial tribunal beinp: an instrumentality of the State its action is State action ·and so it will be under the same disabilities as the State to do a thing which it is incompetent or impermissible. for the State to 'do. It is also said that. what a State cannot do directly it cannot do t indirectly. In so far as the incompetency of the State arises out of a constitutional prohibition or lack of legal authority due to any reason whatso- ever, it will attarh itself to the action of the quasi- judioial tribunal purporting to act as the instrumen- tality of the State. Where, in such a oa.ee, any fundamental right of a person is violated by the action of the quasi-judicial tribunal that per1on i1 • ' '< ( ,. ~ I .. I .. I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 989 entitled to treat the action as arbitrary or a nullity and come up to this court under Art. 32 because the action would be one which is not authorised by law. But while an erroneous action of tne State in exercise of its administrative functions can be chal- lenged directly under Art. 32 if it affects a person's fundamental right on the ground that it is not authorised by law the action of the tribunal purau- a.nt to an erroneous order will not be open to chal- lenge for the reason that its action arises out of the exercise of a judicial power and is thus authorised by law, State action though it be. When, under the provisions of a law, the State exercises judicial power, as for instance, by entertaining an appeal or revision or assessing or levying a tax it acts as a qua.sHudicial tribunal and its decision even though erroneous will no~ be a nullity and cannot be ignored. It can be corrected only under Art. 226 or Art. 227 by the High Court or under Art. 136 by this Court inasmuch as the State would then be acting as a.quasi-judicial tribunal. To summarise, my conclusions are these : I. The question of enforcement of a fundamental right will arise if a tax is asses- sed under a law which is (a) void under Art. 13 or (b) is ultra vire.s the Constitution or (c) where it is subordinate legislation, it is ultra vire.s the law under which it is made or inconsistent with any other law in force. 2. A similar question will also arise if the tax is assessed and/or levied by an autho- rity (a) other than the one empowered to do so under the taxing law or (b) in violation of the procedure prescribed by the law or ( c) in colourable exercise of the powers conferred by the law. 3. No fundamental right is breached and 19H Smt. Ujjam Bot v. State of Ultar Pr•sh M udholl:or J, B.,. lljjam Bai v. Stolt oj U'to' Pradesh Muiliolkar J. 990 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [19631 consequently no question of enforcing a funda- mental right arises where a tax is assessed and levied bona fide by a competent authority under a valid law by following the procedure laid down by that law, even though it be based upon an erroneous construction of the law except when by reason of the constmc- tion placed upon the law a tax is assessed and levied which is beyond the competenc11 of the legislature or is violative of the provi- sions of Part III or of any other provisions of the Constitution. 4. A mere misconstruction of a provi- sion of law does not render the decision of a quasi-judicial tribunal void (as being beyond its jur~diction). It is a good and valid deci- sion in law until and unless it is corrected in the appropriate manner. So long as that decision stands, despite its being erroneous, it must be regarded as one authorised by law and where, under such a decision a person is held liable to pay a tax that person cannot treat the decision as a nullity and contend that what is demanded of him is something which is not authorised by law. The position would be the same even though upon a proper construction, the law under which the decision was given did not authorise such a levy. My answer to each of the two questions is in the negative. BY CouRT: Jn accordance with the judg r m~ntR of the majority, Writ Petition No. 7ll of 1959 is dismissed, but the parties will bear their own costs. C. M. P.
