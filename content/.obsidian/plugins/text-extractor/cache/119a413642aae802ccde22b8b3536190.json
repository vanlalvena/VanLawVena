The warrants were to be converted into equity shares within a period of eighteen months from the date of allotment. In the extraordinary general meeting held on 29-11-2006, the shareholders had approved issuance of 10,00,000 warrants with face value of Rs 10 each with premium of Rs 121 each on preferential basis to KLL (R 1-3), an identified member of the promoter group, to be converted into equity shares within a period of eighteen months. On 12-3-2007, the respondents acquired 13,00,000 shares in KEL in two tranches i.e. 5,00,000 in one transaction and 8,00,000 shares in the other. Upon receipt of the full consideration in terms of the warrants, KEL had issued shares to the respondents consequent to which the shareholdings of the respondents and the promoter group underwent a change. The respondents were served with the show-cause notice dated 26-3-2012 issued by the Board with respect to violation of Regulations 10 and 11 ( 1) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 (\"the 1997 Regulations\"), calling upon them to show cause why suitable directions under Sections 11 and 11-B of the 1992 Act and Regulations 44 and 45 of the 1997 Regulations read with corresponding provisions of Regulations 33 and 35 of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 2011 (\"the 2011 Regulations\") should not be issued against them. Violation of Regulation 10 was predicated on the ground that on 12-3-2007, shareholding of KLL (R 1-3) had individually increased from 10.52% to 17.16% and thereby it was mandatory for KLL to make a public announcement in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 10 read with Regulation 14(1) of the 1997 Regulations within four working days from 12-3-2007. Further, on 12-3-2007, the collective shareholding of the promoter group, including the acquirers, had increased from 25.83% to 34.21 % and, therefore, the acquirers collectively were required to make a public announcement in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 11 ( 1) read with Regulation 14(1) of the 1997 Regulations within four working days from 12-3-2007. The Whole-Time Member of the Board did not agree with the submissions made by the respondents and vide his order dated 31-12-2012 held that there was violation of Regulations 10 and 11(1) of the 1997 Regulations and, therefore, the respondents shall make a combined public announcement to acquire shares of the target company, namely, KEL, in terms of Regulations 10 and 11 ( 1) of the 1997 Regulations within forty-five days of the order. Further the respondent, along with the consideration amount, shall pay interest @ 10% p.a. from 16-6-2007 till the date of payment to the shareholders who were holding shares in KEL on the date of violation, and whose shares shall be accepted in the open offer, albeit after adjustment of dividend, if any, paid. The respondents preferred an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal, which by the impugned order has been partly allowed. The Appellate Tribunal has held that Regulation 10 was not violated, but Regulation 11(1) was violated albeit the direction with regard to issue of public announcement and open offer was not sustainable at a belated stage.

However, monetary penalty of Rs 25,000,00 was imposed. The issues involved in these appeals were: (J) Whether there was a violation of Regulation 10 of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 i.e. whether individual increase in shareholding of KLL (R 1-3) from 10.52% to 17 .16% made it mandatory for KLL to make a public announcement in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 10 read with Regulation 14(1)? (2) Whether the Board was justified in exercise of its power under Regulation 44 read with Regulation 45 of the 1997 Regulations? (3) Whether the Appellate Tribunal could have exercised its jurisdiction and power under Section 15-T of the Securities and Exchange Board of India c Act, 1992 (\"the 1992 Act\")? d e f g h ( 4) Whether the delay in issue of show-cause notice itself would exonerate defaulters under the 1992 Act? Dismissing the appeal of the Board, the Supreme Court Held: Interpretation of Regulation 10 of the 1997 Regulations The expression \"acquirer\", as defined in the 1997 Regulations, is broad, wide and is given an expansive definition. An \"acquirer\" is a person who directly or indirectly acquires or agrees to acquire shares or control over the target company by himself or with any person acting in concert with him. The phrase \"directly or indirectly\" as well as the expressions \"acquired shares or voting rights\" and \"with any person acting in concert with the acquirer\" underlines the extensive and widespread ambit of the term \"acquirer\". The term \"acquirer\" is not restricted to the person or individual shareholder as it encompasses any other person acting in concert with the \"acquirer\". (Para 45) The expression \"person acting in concert\" as defined in clause ( e) of Regulation 2( 1) is again broad and expansive. The expression \"person acting in concert\" as per sub-clause (1) of clause (e) includes a person, who for a common object or for purpose of substantial acquisition of shares, voting rights, gaining control over the company, pursuant to an agreement or understanding formal or informal, directly or indirectly, cooperate by acquiring or agreeing to acquire shares or voting rights in a target company or to take control over a target company. Sub-clause (2) of clause (e) of Regulation 2( 1) incorporates legal fiction as it states that the persons enumerated in clauses (i) to (x) shall be deemed to be persons acting in concert with other persons in the same category. The Note to clause ( e) of Regulation 2( 1) explains the expression \"associate\" as a relative of the person within the meaning of Section 6 of the Companies Act, 1956, family trust and Hindu Undivided Families. However, the presumption raised vide sub-clause (2) of Regulation 2(1)(e) is qualified and subject to - \"unless the contrary is established\". Therefore, if the contrary is established, the presumption raised vide clauses (i) to (x) may not apply in entirety or only apply in part limited to specific shareholder(s) or the persons mentioned ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The factual matrix is determinative as clause (e) vide sub-clause (1) of Regulation 2(1) of the 1997 Regulations lays down a derivative or spin-off rule of interpretation, and even when the presumption under sub-clause (2) arises, the adjudicator will not apply the presumption when the fact to the contrary are established. The presumption is to be looked as \"the bats of law, flitting in the twilight but disappearing in the sunshine of facts\". (Para 46) G. Vasu v. Yaseen Sifuddin Quadri, 1986 SCC OnLine AP 147: AIR 1987 AP 139, referred to The object of the aforesaid wide definitions is to ensure that no one is able to dribble past and defeat the 1997 Regulations by resorting to camouflage and subterfuge. (Para 4 7) The word \"acquirer\" used in Regulation 10 takes its meaning from the definition clause (b) of Regulation 2(1), which refers to the shareholder as an individual and also \"person acting in concert\" with the him, which expression has been very widely defined vide clause (e) of Regulation 2(1) of the 1997 Regulations. The Appellate Tribunal has, therefore, rightly held that the word \"acquirer\", which is a term of art, should not be restricted to shares or voting rights of the individual shareholder as the term as defined includes the \"person acting in concert\" with the shareholder. The shareholding/voting rights of the \"acquirer\", that is, the individual shareholder together with the \"person acting in concert\" decides whether the \"acquirer\" is required to make a public offer/announcement in terms of Regulation 10, which applies when the voting rights of the \"acquirer\" before acquisition were less than 15%, but on fresh acquisition exceed 15% of the voting rights in the company. Regulation 10 does not apply when the collective voting rights of the individual shareholder and the \"person acting in concert\", taken together is 15% or more on the date when fresh shares or voting rights are acquired. The bracketed portion of Regulation 10, namely, \"taken together with shares or voting rights, if any, held by him or by persons acting in concert with him\" affirms and endorses this interpretation. (Para 49) Brooks v. Brooks, 1996 AC 375 : (l 995) 3 WLR 141 (HL) , referred to When a word/term has been defined in a statute in a particular manner then the interpreter can assume the word/term must be understood in the stipulated sense. The principle applies with greater vigour when the definition of the word/term is given a legal and substantive meaning, different from the common meaning, as then the writer demands that the reader should understand the term/word in the sense defined. When the content and meaning given is technical, the interpreter is entitled to infer that the intention of the draftsmen is to deviate and depart from the ordinary, literal or customary meaning. Therefore, when a statutory enactment consciously defines a word or expression by enlarging or restricting the ordinary meaning, in the absence of clear indication to the contrary, the term as defined shall cover what is proposed, authorised, done or referred to in the enactment. This principle can be also discarded when the definition read and applied would not agree with the subject and context thereby making the provision unworkable or otiose.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h SEBI v. SUNIL KRISHNA KHAITAN 649 Regulation 10 applies to the \"acquirer\" acquiring voting rights, with reference to the existing holding as a person and in concert with other persons, because the acquisition is to be \"taken together with shares or voting rights held by the acquirer himself or by person acting in concert with him\". The combined holding of the person and the \"person acting in concert\" determines application of Regulation 10. If an \"acquirer\" already holds more than 15% shares or voting rights in concert with other persons, such holding is not to be fragmented to calculate the shares or voting rights of the \"acquirer\" in his personal capacity under Regulation 10. (Para 51) The language and the wording of Regulation 10 clearly differs from the language and wording of Regulation 11 (1) of the 1997 Regulations. In Regulation 11(1), an acquirer, either himself or through or with any person acting in concert with him, has 15% or more but less than 55% shares/voting rights, is required to make a public announcement in accordance with the Regulation when he, either by himself or through or with persons acting in concert with him, acquire additional shares or voting rights entitling him to exercise more than 5% of the voting shares in addition to already acquired shares/voting rights. (Para 52) Thus Regulation 10 does not apply when the \"acquirer\" already holds more than 15% shares or voting rights in the target company. The \"acquirer\", for the purpose of the said Regulation, not only means the individual person but also the \"person acting in concert\" with the individual person. In such cases, Regulation 11(1) may apply when the \"acquirer\" who holds between 15% to 55% of shares or voting rights, post the acquisition of the additional shares or voting rights is entitled to exercise more than 5% of the voting rights. (Para 53) A \"person acting in concert\" as defined in clause (e) of Regulation 2(1) is a fluctuating and not a fixed body of persons. When there are divisions and differences between or amongst the \"person acting in concert\", or even otherwise, an acquirer acts at his own behest or in concert with a different persons or group, Regulation 10 may catch up. Definitions of the terms, \"acquirer\" and \"person acting in concert\" are situation and fact specific. The legal fiction vide sub-clause (2) of Regulation 2(l)(e), specifically stipulates, unless contrary is established. Yes, there could be situations when the \"person(s) acting in concert\" holding more than 15% voting rights post the said acquisition may part ways, but Regulation 10 is not attracted and applicable to such situations. To argue that public shareholders can predict such events and therefore the Board's interpretation is more acceptable is imaginative but an uncompelling and a weak argument. (Para 54) There is ample material, and it is accepted by the Board that they had read the expression \"acquirer\" in Regulation 10 to mean and include the shareholder along with \"person acting in concert\". Meaning thereby, there would not be any violation of Regulation 10 if the \"acquirer\", which would include the \"person acting in concert\", acquires new shares or voting rights when he individually or along with the \"person in concert\", already holds more than 15% shares in the target company. This interpretation was accepted and even communicated by the Board to third parties. Adjudicating officer(s) have accepted this interpretation and dropped penalty proceedings, which orders have attained finality and accepted by the Board.

Further regulations must be clear as ambiguous regulations cause confusion and uncertainty. Regularity and predictability, along with certainty, are hallmarks of good regulation and governance. These principles underpin the \"rule of law\", check arbitrariness and are read as the intent of the legislation, which the courts, if need be, will enforce as a principle of interpretation.

In the context of the present case, the Board, nearly five years after the transactions, had issued the show-cause notice and then passed an order taking a view on interpretation of Regulation 10, which was contrary to the view expressed by it in several communications as also orders passed by the adjudicating authority. Past is passe and not present, and by giving \"retroactive\" operation without good reason and ground, the direction violates fundamental notions of predictability and legal stability. (Para 61) Mathew P. Harrington: Foreword: The Dual Dichotomy of Retroactive Lawmaking, referred to The principle of doubtful penalisation would be applicable in the present case. It is a well-settled rule of construction of penal statutes that if two views and reasonable constructions can be put on a provision, the court must lean in favour of construction which exempts the subject from penalty rather than one which imposes penalty. (Para 62) The principle of doubtful penalisation, often limited to criminal statutes, in fact, extends to any form of detriment. (Para 64) Tolaram Relumal v. State of Bombay, (1955) 1 SCR 158: AIR 1954 SC 496,followed Bipinchandra Parshottamdas Patel v. State of Gujarat, (2003) 4 SCC 642 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 831; London & North Eastern Railway Co. v.

Carrington, (1765) 19 State Tr 1029: 95 ER 807; Natural Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference No. 1 of 2012, (2012) 10 SCC 1, referred to Sullivan, Ruth: Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 4th Edn. (Markham, Ont.: Butterworths, 2002) at p. 387; Francis Bennion: Bennion on Statutory Interpretation, 5th Edn. (Indian reprint) Section 271 at p. 827, referred to The contention of the Board that there is no estoppel against law is well known, but the said principle is not applicable for several reasons. First, the interpretation accepted by the Appellate Tribunal is not only plausible but more acceptable than the interpretation propounded by the Board. Secondly, the Board, which has the power to enact the Regulations, interpret and apply them, adjudicate and also pass a penalty order in case of violation for good and substantial reasons had interpreted regulations in the same manner in earlier instances as interpreted by the Appellate Tribunal. Thirdly, the adjudication orders in the present case were passed well after the 1997 Regulations were repealed with the enactment and enforcement of the 2011 Regulations. In the present case, therefore, we are dealing with a legacy issue. Regulation I O of the 1997 Regulations, as interpreted and applied by the Board for over ten years, is sought to be overturned by the Board, thereby, creating penal consequences. This should not be permitted and is hardly acceptable when we apply the principle of good governance and regulation. (Para 70) The argument of the Board that the 2011 Regulations are retrospective is to be only noted and rejected. The impugned order passed by the Appellate Tribunal in Madhuri S. Pitti, 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 100 specifically records that the Board had conceded that the 2011 Regulations do not have any retrospective application. The contention that the 2011 Regulations are clarificatory and, therefore, retrospective is ex facie fallacious and untenable. (Para 71) In the aforesaid background, on the enforcement of the 2011 Regulations, it is clear that Regulation 10 will apply on an acquirer who crosses the threshold of 15%, which under the 2011 Regulations, has been increased to 25%. Further, Regulation 10 would apply both when an individual acquirer or an acquirer in concert with others acquires shares or voting rights beyond the threshold level and such an acquirer would have to comply with the applicable regulation. The 1997 Regulations and the 2011 Regulations, therefore, postulate different preconditions and thresholds. Reliance placed upon the Takeover Regulatory Advisory Committee Report would show that there was a rethought and re- examination of Regulation 10 pursuant to which Regulation 3(3) was enacted and made a part of the regulatory mechanism under the 2011 Regulations. (Para 72) It is a general rule of law of interpretation that unless explicitly mentioned, a law cannot be presumed to be retrospective. (Para 73) CITv. Vatika Township (P) Ltd., (2015) 1 SCC l,followed L'Office Cherifien des Phosphates v. Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. Ltd. , (1994) 1 AC 486 : (1994) 2 WLR 39 (HL), cited Further, in the absence of express statutory authorisation, delegated legislation in the form of rules or regulations, cannot operate retrospectively. Certainly, Regulation 3(3) in the 2011 Regulations clarified and possibly removed the shortcoming of the 1997 Regulations. However, the language of Regulation 3(3) is apparently not of clarificatory or declaratory nature.

Indusind Bank Ltd., (2016) 9 SCC 720: (2016) 4 SCC (Civ) 545, relied on Regulation 11 and the penalty under Regulations 44 and 45 of the 1997 Regulations The impugned order in Sunil Krishna Khaitan, 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 25 dismisses the appeal preferred by the respondents and thereby affirms the order holding the respondents guilty of violation of Regulation 11 (1) of the 1997 Regulations. The respondents have not filed appeals or cross-objections challenging the said finding of the Appellate Tribunal. (Para 75) The contention of the Board is that the Appellate Tribunal should not have modified the direction given by the Whole-Time Member obligating public announcement with the monetary penalty of Rs 25,00,000. (Para 76) Regulation 44 states that the Board, without prejudice to their rights to initiate action under Chapter VI-A and Section 24 of the 1992 Act, may in the interest of the securities market or for protection of the interests of the investors, issue such directions as it may deem fit. Thereafter, it specifies certain directions in clauses (a) to (i), using the word \"including\", which implies that the directions issued by the Board can include the directions given in clauses (a) to (i), albeit the Board may issue directions even beyond what is stated in clauses (a) to (i).Thus, the Board's power to give directions is wide. This is also clear from the relevant provisions of the 1992 Act, namely, Sections 11 and 11-B and Section 11(2)(h). (Para 79) The use of the word \"may\" in Regulation 44 and the wording of Sections 11 ( 1 ), 11-B and 11(2)(h) reflect that the Board has been conferred a discretion, which in turn also means and should be interpreted as imposing a duty. Use of the word \"may\" over the years is normally construed as permissive and not imperative. The words \"may\" or \"shall\" by their very etymological foundation denote discretion and mandatory nature of an act respectively. (Para 80) Official Liquidator v. Dharti Dhan (P) Ltd., (1977) 2 SCC 166; Dinesh Chandra Pandey v. High Court of M.P., (2010) 11 SCC 500 : (2011) 1 SCC (L&S) 804; Mohan Singh v. International Airport Authority of India, (1997) 9 SCC 132, relied on Rajender Mohan Rana v. Prem Prakash Chaudhary, 2011 SCC OnLine Del 3684, referred to Use of the word \"may\" and not \"shall\" in Regulation 44 is significant. It is not mandatory that in case of every violation and breach of Regulations 10, 11 and 12, direction under Regulation 44 shall be issued. (Para 81) The Board, therefore, when it decides to exercise its power under Regulation 44 and issues directions under the said Regulation has to keep the two facets in mind, namely, (i) interest of the securities market; and (ii) protection of interest of the investors. The exercise of discretion of the Board, in fact, would not be restricted to the two facets mentioned above as the power and functions of the Board are far broader as they include promotion, development and regulation of securities market as a whole and regulating substantial acquisition of shares and takeover of companies.

SUNIL KRISHNA KHAITAN 653 Discretion is an effective and an important tool which the legislature confers and vests with the executive for effective and good governance, administration, and in the present case - regulation, of the securities market which has complex commercial and economic facets. Therefore, the law provides an option to the Board and the authorities to adopt one or the other alternatives. However, this does not mean that the Board or the authorities enjoy unfettered and unchecked discretionary jurisdiction to act according to private or personal opinion in a vague and fanciful manner. (Para 82) Susannah Sharp v. Wakefield, 1891 AC 173 (HL); Sant Raj v. O.P. Singla, (1985) 2 SCC 349 : 1985 SCC (L&S) 435; S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India, AIR 1967 SC 1427; Clariant International Ltd. v. SEE/, (2004) 8 SCC 524; Bangalore Medical Trust v. B.S. Muddappa, ( 1 991) 4 SCC 54, referred to In the context of Regulations 44 and 45, it implies that the Board has the power to make a choice between different courses of action or inaction. This choice is not unfettered but is always held subject to implied limitations inherent in every statute, limitations set by the common law and the constitutional mandate of rule of law. (Para 83) De Smith's Judicial Review, 7th Edn., [Sweet and Maxwell (South Asian Edn.)] at Heading 9-005 on p. 515; C . Hilson: \"Judicial Review, Policies and the Fettering of Discretion\" 2002 PL 11; D. Galligan: \"The Nature and Functions of Policy Within Discretionary Power\" 1976 PL 332, referred to Clearly, therefore, Regulation 44 differs from Section 15-H of the 1992 Act, which is somewhat a strict liability provision that applies if a person fails to comply with clauses (i) to (iv) . It may be, however, noted that Section 15-H prescribes the lower as well as the higher monetary penalty limits. These stipulations have undergone modifications and changes from time to time. As per the amendments made by Act 59 of 2002, with retrospective effect from 29-10-2002, the penalty which can be imposed is not to be less than Rs 10,00,000 but may extend up to Rs 25,00,00,000 or three times the amount of profits made out of such failure, whichever is higher. The phase \"profits made out of such failure\" in Section 15-H indicates that while imposing quantum of penalty the authority should consider the profit made by the acquirer on account of failure to comply with the requirements mentioned in clauses (i) to (iv) of Section 15-H. (Para 84) The authorities have a right to take recourse to multiple proceedings which have been loosely classified and referred to as \"penalties\" in Regulation 45(6). Now here, however, Regulation 45 stipulates that in case of violation of Regulations 10, 11 or 12 of the 1997 Regulations, the Board must initiate action and issue directions in terms of Regulation 44. The Board, in appropriate case, may take action under Regulation 44 and issue directions, but when it issues such directions, it must keep in mind the interest of securities market and to the protect the interests of the investors. Existence and conferment of power, and reasonable and legitimate exercise of the power in accordance with law are two different facets . (Para 87) The violation alleged in Appeal No. 23 of 2013 in Sunil Krishna Khaitan case relates to the years 2006-2007. The order issuing the directions was passed on 31-12-2012, nearly eight years after the alleged violation. The direction given is that the shareholders should be given an option to sell the shares held by them on 16-6-2007 by directing the respondents to make a public announcement to acquire the shares. Direction has also been given to pay interest@ 10% p.a. from 16-6-2007 till shares have been accepted in the open offer.

The directions of this nature are not automatic and are to be issued only when they are warranted and justified. The incongruities and absurdities of the directions issued have been highlighted and noticed in the order passed by the Appellate Tribunal. (Para 90) In this case, directions of the Board for amendment of the letter of offer was issued after a lapse of more than one year as the draft letter of offer was submitted on 19-9-2011 and the directions were issued vide letter dated 17-12-2012. Further, these directions were for the reason that the acquirer had failed to comply with Regulation 10 of the 1997 Regulations in the remote past, that is, in the year 2006 and 2007. Clearly, this is whimsical and arbitrary exercise of discretion by the Board which would have led to chaos and confusion. (Para 91) In the absence of any period of time and limitation prescribed by the enactment, every authority is to exercise power within a reasonable period. What would be the reasonable period would depend upon facts of each case, such as whether the violation was hidden and camouflaged and thereby the Board or the authorities did not have any knowledge. Though, no hard and fast rules can be laid down in this regard as determination of the question will depend on the facts of each case, the nature of the statute, the rights and liabilities thereunder and other consequences, including prejudice caused and whether third party rights have been created are relevant factors. Whenever a question with regard to inordinate delay in issuance of a show-cause notice is made, it is open to the noticee to contend that the show- cause notice is bad on the ground of delay and it is the duty of the authority/officer to consider the question objectively, fairly and in a rational manner. There is public interest involved in not taking up and spending time on stale matters and, therefore, exercise of power, even when no time is specified, should be done within reasonable time. This prevents miscarriage of justice, misuse and abuse of the power as well as ensures that the violation of the provisions are checked and penalised without delay, thereby effectuating the purpose behind the enactment. (Para 93) State of Gujarat v. Patil Raghav Natha, (1969) 2 SCC 187; Mansaram v. S.P. Pathak, (1984) 1 SCC 125; Union of India v. Citedal Fine Pharmaceuticals, (1989) 3 SCC 483: 1989 SCC (Tax) 464; State of Orissa v. Brundaban Sharma, 1995 Supp (3) SCC 249; State of Punjab v. Bhatinda District Coop. Milk Producers Union Ltd., (2007) 11 SCC 363, relied on SEBI v. Bhavesh Pabari, (2019) 5 SCC 90, clarified Regulations 6, 7 and 8 of the 1997 Regulations require the acquirer/ shareholders to make disclosures to the company as well as to the stock exchange where the shares are listed. Violation of Regulations 6, 7 and 8 is not alleged. While it is true that the said disclosures and public notice of the disclosures cannot be treated as disclosure to the Board or authorities under the Act, the Board and the authorities, as a good regulator, cannot also claim complete ignorance. Significantly, in the present case, the investors of the target company have not raised any objection. The impugned order passed by the Whole-Time Member does not refer to any market manipulation or fluctuation in share price, which was detrimental to the interests of the investors. It is not the case of the Board that any windfall gains or profits have been made by the respondents on account of violation of Regulation 11 (1) of the 1997 Regulations.

The directions, therefore, cannot be sustained. (Para 94) Power of the Appellate Tribunal under Section 15-T of the 1992 Act The Board has contended that the Appellate Tribunal, in the exercise of power under Section 15-T and while considering appeals against proceedings under Sections 11 and 11-B of the 1992 Act and Regulation 44 of the 1997 Regulations, could not have converted the directions of the Board with monetary penalty under Section 15-H. (Para 97) Sunil Krishna Khaitan v. SEEi, 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 25, referred to The appeal before the Appellate Tribunal under Section 15-T, is the first appeal against the decision of the Board or the adjudicating officer. First appeal is a continuation or is co-terminus with the proceedings of the original adjudicating authority. The first appeal is a valuable right of the party aggrieved, and all questions of fact and law decided by the Board or the adjudicating authority, including exercise of discretion whether within the law, are open for full consideration and examination. The Appellate Tribunal, in the absence of any limit, has plenary powers in disposing of an appeal. It can do what the Board/authorities can do and also direct them to do what they have failed to do.

That power is vested with the authority specified in the Act or the Regulations. The Appellate Tribunal is an appellate forum and not the authority empowered to initiate penalty proceedings under Section 15-H or suo motu issue directions under Sections 11, 11-B or 11 ( 4 )(d) of the 1992 Act. It can uphold or set aside the direction issued, or modify and substitute the direction issued under Regulation 44 of the 1997 Regulations read with Sections 11, 11-B and 11(4)(d) of the 1992 Act. Similarly, Appellate Tribunal can uphold, set aside, modify and even substitute the order of penalty under Chapter VI-A of the 1992 Act. The power to initiate and levy penalty in terms of Section 15-1 is vested with an officer to be appointed by the Board, not below the rank of Divisional Commissioner, to act as an adjudicating officer. The adjudicating officer is required to hold an inquiry in the prescribed manner after giving the person a reasonable opportunity of being heard for the purpose of imposing any penalty. Powers are vested with the adjudicating officer to summon and enforce attendance of any person acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case to give evidence or to produce any document.

SEB/1; and the order dated 31-10-2013 in Appeal No. 2 of 2013 titled Madhuri S. Pitti v. SEB/2. 2. Primary questions of law raised in these appeals relates to the b interpretation of Regulation 10 of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as \"the 1997 Takeover Regulations\") the power and exercise of the power by the Board under Regulation 44 read with Regulation 45 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations; and the power and jurisdiction of the Appellate Tribunal under Section 15-T of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (for short \"the Act\"). c A. Background facts (I) Appeal No. 23 of 2013 (Sunil Krishna Khaitan case 1) 3. Khaitan Electrical Ltd. (for short \"KEL\"), a company incorporated in 1975, listed on BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange Ltd., is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing of electrical goods. 4. KEL was founded by late Shri Krishna Khaitan (R 1-2 in the appeal), who had passed away on 4-11-2012 and is represented by his legal representatives. The promoter group consists of his family member/relative and associate entities, which include other respondents in the appeal, namely, Sunil Krishna Khaitan, M/s Khaitan Lefin Ltd. and M/s Oriental Mercantile Company Ltd. (R 1-lst, R 1-3rd and R 1-4th respectively). 5. In the extraordinary general meeting held on 23-3-2006, the shareholders of KEL had approved issuance of 10,00,000 equity share warrants with the face value of Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs 50 each on preferential basis to the respondents. The warrants were to be converted into equity shares within a period of eighteen months from the date of allotment. 6. In the extraordinary general meeting held on 29-11-2006, the shareholders had approved issuance of 10,00,000 warrants with face value of Rs 10 each with premium of Rs 121 each on preferential basis to M/s Khaitan Lefin Ltd. (R 1-3) (for short \"KLL\"), an identified member of the promoter group, to be converted into equity shares within a period of eighteen months. This extraordinary general meeting had also approved issuance of 25 ,00,000 equity shares of face value of Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs 125 each on preferential basis to strategic investors. However, in this appeal, we are not concerned with the issue of shares to the strategic investors. l 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 25 2 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 100 d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The respondents were served with the show-cause notice dated 26-3-2012 issued by the Board with respect to violation of Regulations 10 and 11 (I) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations, calling upon them to show cause why suitable directions under Sections 11 and 11-B of the Act and Regulations 44 and 45 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations read with corresponding provisions of Regulations 33 and 35 of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as \"the 2011 Takeover Regulations\") should not be issued against them. Violation of Regulation 10 was predicated on the ground that on 12-3-2007, shareholding of KLL (R 1-3) had individually increased from 10.52% to 17.16% and thereby it was mandatory for KLL to make a public announcement in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 10 read with Regulation 14(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations within four working days from 12-3-2007. Further, on 12-3-2007, the collective shareholding of the promoter group, including the acquirers, had increased from 25.83% to 34.21 % and, therefore, the acquirers collectively were required to make a public announcement in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 11 (1) read with Regulation 14(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations within four working days from 12-3-2007. 9. The respondents contested the show-cause notice on various grounds, which we will be canvassing subsequently. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The Whole-Time Member3 of the Board did not agree with the submissions made by the respondents and vide his order dated 31-12-2012 held that there was violation of Regulations 10 and 11 ( 1) of the 1997 Takeover a Regulations and, therefore, the respondents shall make a combined public announcement to acquire shares of the target company4, namely, KEL, in terms of Regulations 10 and 11(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations within forty- five days of the order. Further the respondent, along with the consideration amount, shall pay interest@ 10% p.a. from 16-6-2007 till the date of payment to the shareholders who were holding shares in KEL on the date of violation, b and whose shares shall be accepted in the open offer, albeit after adjustment of dividend, if any, paid. The effect of the aforesaid direction in the order dated 31-12-2012 would be examined by us subsequently. 11. The respondents preferred an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal, which by the impugned order1 has been partly allowed. The Appellate Tribunal has held that Regulation 10 was not violated, but Regulation 11 ( 1) was violated c albeit the direction with regard to issue of public announcement and open offer was not sustainable at a belated stage. There was a delay of about 5 years in issuing the show-cause notice relating to acquisition/incidents which pertain to the year 2006-2007, and as the impugned order came to be passed only on 31-12-2012, the directions of the Whole-Time Member for issue of public announcement and open offer were set aside. However, monetary penalty of d Rs 25,00,000 has been imposed. (Il)Appeal No. 2 o/2013 (Madhuri S. Pitti case 2) 12. Pitti Laminations Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"PLL\") was incorporated in the year 1983 under the Companies Act, 1956 and its six promoters, namely, Mr Sharad B. Pitti, Ms Madhuri Pitti (R2-1), Mr Akshay S.

On 22-6-2005, PLL allotted 3,90,000 shares and 4,10,000 warrants convertible into equity shares to R 2-3. On 26-4-2006, R 2-3 converted some warrants into equity shares which increased his individual shareholding in PLL from 11.87% to 16.25%. 3 See Section 4(1)(d) of the Act: \"4.

On 11-4-2007, R 2-3 converted the remaining warrants into equity shares of PLL, which again increased his individual shareholding in PLL from a 14.88% to 15.77%. b C d e f g h 15. At the annual general meeting of PLL on 11-8-2011, a preferential allotment of 40,50,000 equity shares to R 2-l and R 2-2 was authorised by the shareholders of PLL. This resulted in increase in the total shareholding of the three respondents (R2-1, R 2-2 and R 2-3) with that of Mr Sharad Pitti from 41.70% to 59.21 %. 16. Accordingly, a public announcement was made on 9-9-2011 and simultaneously, a draft letter of offer was filed before the Board for its approval on 19-9-2011. 17. On a query by the Board, Rr3 on 28-11-2011, wrote a letter denying his failures to make public announcement at the time of acquisition of shares by him on 22-6-2005, and 26-4-2006. Subsequently, on 19-3-2012 a hearing was afforded to him in this regard. Thereafter, R 2-3 had submitted replies on three occasions on the respect of his purported failure to make public announcement at the time of acquisition of the shares in 2005 and 2006. 18. After a lapse of more than one year, the Board through Assistant General Manager, Corporate Finance Department, Division of Corporate Restructuring issued the letter dated 17-12-2012, mandating the Merchant Banker of the respondents to inter alia revise the schedule of the offer by taking into account the acquisitions made by R 2-3 on 26-4-2006 and 11-4-2007 and thereby, revise the offer price to the shareholders. 19. The respondents challenged the letter before the Appellate Tribunal, which vide impugned order dated 31-10-20132 allowed the appeal and permitted the respondents to continue with their offer excluding the Board's directions relating to the acquisitions by R 2-3 in the years 2006 and 2007. The impugned order observes that the Board by such letters could not issue directions to listed companies, by terming it as a mere advice without giving any choice in the matter. Further, placing reliance on the impugned order herein in Sunil Krishna Khaitan v. SEB/1 decided on 19-6-2013, the Appellate Tribunal observed that to determine whether or not the limit under Regulation 10 has been crossed, shareholdings of all members of the group of persons acting in concert would have to be reckoned as a whole. 5 2 Madhuri S. Pitti v. SEBI, 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 100 1 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 25 5 In Appeal No. 2 of 2013 (Madhuri S. Pitti v. SEBI, 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 100), there is no specific order under Regulation 44 by the Whole-Time Member, albeit, as noticed above, directions were issued by the Board to amend the draft letter of offer submitted by PLL for the Board's approval on 19-9-2011, vide the Board's letter dated 17-12-2012. The Appe11ate Tribunal has adversely commented on the Board's conduct in issuing the said direction by directing amendment of the draft letter of offer. During the course of arguments, the Board has not specifically challenged the observations and the adverse finding of the Appellate Tribunal that such directions could not have been issued by the Board vide letter dated 17-12-2012. We will not make any comments or give findings in this regard. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

On 12-3-2007, individual shareholding of KLL (R 1-3) in KEL had increased from 10.52% to 17.16%, whereas shareholding of the promoter group had collectively increased from 25.83% to 34.21 %. Thus, there was a violation of both Regulation 10 and Regulation 11 (1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. 21. On 26-4-2006, shareholding of R 2-3 in PLL had increased from 11.87% to 16.25%. Again, on 11-4-2007, shareholding of Rr3 had increased from 14.88% to 15.77%. However, no public announcement for open offer was made by R 2-3 or by the acquirer group within the period of four days from the respective dates. 22. The objective of the 1997 Takeover Regulations is to bring to the knowledge of the shareholders of the company any change in substantial ownership of the company and to provide an exit opportunity through an open offer in case of such substantial change. 23. Regulations 10 and 11(1) have to be read accordingly and in line with the objective of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. 24. Regulations 10, 11 and 12 operate in three distinct fields in which the acquirer of shares or voting rights of the company is required to make a public announcement and make an open offer to acquire shares of existing shareholders. These Regulations may overlap in some cases as in the present case, but are not mutually exclusive, as has been held by this Court in Swedish MatchAB v. SEB/6. 25. Impugned judgment and reasoning given by the Appellate Tribunal is contrary to the objective of Regulation 10, which is to ensure that an exit option is provided to the existing shareholders once any person, whether individually, and or along with any another person acting in concert with each other, acquires shares that cross the 15% threshold. Such acquirer or group, as the case may be, would be able to exercise sufficient degree of control over the management of the company, which may not be in the interest of the company and, therefore, exit option should be given to the existing shareholders. 26. In contrast, the objective of Regulation 11 is to provide an opportunity to the shareholders to exit in case an acquirer of shares, having 15% or more but less than 55% of the shares or voting rights, either individually or with persons acting in concert, increases their shareholding or voting rights over 5 % at any given point in a financial year. As such acquisition enables the individual or the person acting in concert with others to yield greater influence over management of the company, and Regulation 11 ( 1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations provides for an exit option to the existing shareholders. 27. Regulation 3(3) of the 2011 Takeover Regulations makes explicit what was already implicit in the 1997 Takeover Regulations, that in a case an individual within the group crosses the stipulated minimum shareholding threshold, such an individual shall make a public offer even when there is no change in aggregate shareholdings of the group, that is, persons acting in 6 c2004) 11 sec 641 a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Reference is made to the report of the Takeover Regulation Advisory Committee headed by Mr C. Achuthan, which exhibits that Regulation 3(3) is to clarify the requirement that was already existing in the 1997 Takeover Regulations. 28. There is no estoppel against a statute and, therefore, the respondents in appeals herein cannot take any advantage and plead that the Board is deviating from its earlier stance. Reference is made to Sanjeev Coke Mfg. Co. v. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. 7 In fact, the interpretation given by the Board in these appeals has been accepted by the Appellate Tribunal in certain cases. 29. The Board has been conferred with powers under the Act in terms of Section 11 thereof to issue appropriate direction for protection of interest of the shareholders; under Section 15-H read with Section 15-1 to impose monetary penalty on the defaulter; and under Section 24 to criminally prosecute the defaulter for contravention of the provisions of the Act or Regulations thereunder. These are separate powers vested with the Board with distinct objectives, which can sometimes be overlapping but are not identical, as has been held by this Court in Prakash Gupta v. SEB/8. The Board being an expert body is entitled to exercise the aforesaid powers to subserve the interest of the investors as well as to promote orderly and healthy growth of the securities market. 30. The Appellate Tribunal should not have interfered with the directions to make an open offer, which are in line with the objective of Sections 11 and 11-B of the Act read with Regulation 44 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. The order passed by the Whole-Time Member directing making of public announcement for open offer along with paying interest to the shareholders of the target company, was made with the larger objective of protecting interests of the shareholders who have a right and expectation to be provided with the opportunity to exit the company in case the shareholding/voting rights of a person and/or persons acting in concert crosses the stipulated threshold at any point of time. 31. Scope of power of the Appellate Tribunal enumerated in Section 15-T does not extend to substituting directions issued under Sections 11 and 11-B of the Act with monetary penalty under Section 15-H of the Act. The scope of power of the Appellate Tribunal is wide but cannot be exercised in a manner which is inconsistent with the scheme of the Act. Further, the directions issued for public announcement and open offer are in line with the objectives of the Act which states that as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation is established, penalties must follow. This is a distinct objective envisaged in Sections 11 and 11-B of the Act read with Regulation 44 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations, as has been held in several decisions of this Court in Zile Singh v. State of Haryana 9 , SEBI v. Shriram Mutual Fund 10 and SEBI v.

The Appellate Tribunal does not exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and is a creation of the statute and, therefore, cannot pass any order inconsistent with the scheme of the Act. Thus, imposition of monetary penalty for violation of Regulation 11(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations, as directed by the Appellate Tribunal, is contrary to law and would also result in weakening of investor confidence in securities market as defaulters would be able to escape the obligation. 33. Lastly, the delay in issue of show-cause notice itself would not exonerate the defaulters under the Act and the relevant Regulations, as has been held in SEBI v. Bhavesh Pabari12 . 34. For brevity, we are not reproducing the submissions made by the respondents as they would be noticed subsequently and are inferable from our reasoning, which upholds the orders by the Appellate Tribunal on the interpretation of Regulation 10 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. Secondly, we have upheld the order of the Appellate Tribunal setting aside the directions of public announcement with open offer given by the Whole-Time Member under Regulation 44 for violation of Regulation 11(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations in the case of Sunil Kumar Khaitan in Appeal No. 8249 of 2013. However on the aspect of the power of Appellate Tribunal under Section 15-T of the Act, we have expressed our reservation and disagreed with the Appellate Tribunal for the reasons set out below. C. Relevant provisions 35. We begin by reproducing the relevant provisions of the 1997 Takeover Regulations which are as under: \"2.

Sub-regulation (1-A) to Regulation 7 states that any acquirer who has acquired shares or voting rights of the company, under sub-regulation (1) to Regulation 11 or under the second proviso to sub-regulation (2) to Regulation 11, shall disclose the purchase or sale aggregating 2% or more of the share capital of the target company to the target company, and to the stock exchanges where the shares of the target company are listed within two days of such purchase or sale along with aggregate of shareholding after such acquisition or sale. The Explanation to Regulations 7(1) and (1-A) states that the term \"acquirer\" for sub-regulations (1) and (1-A) shall include a pledgee, other than a bank or financial institution. Such pledgee shall make a disclosure to the target company and the stock exchange within two days of creation of the pledge. 39. Sub-regulation (2-A) to Regulation 7 states that the stock exchange shall immediate I y display the information received from the acquirer under sub- regulations (1) and (1-A) on the trading screen, the notice board and also on its website. 40. Sub-regulation (3) of Regulation 7 requires every company whose shares are acquired in the manner referred to in sub-regulations (1) and (1-A) to disclose to all stock exchanges, on which the shares of the said company are listed, the aggregate number of shares held by such persons referred above, within seven days ofreceipt of information under sub-regulations (1) and (1-A) of Regulation 7 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. 41. Regulation 6 exposits transparency and openness which is required in the form of disclosure to be made by the shareholders, promoters or a person having control over the company, as well as the company in which they hold the shares. The information is not only given to the stock exchanges where the shares of the company are listed but are also put in the public domain so as to inform the shareholders and others. Similar transparency and openness is mandated by Regulation 7 which uses the expression \"acquirer\", and applies when the \"acquirer\" acquires shares or voting rights of the specified percentage in the company. Regulation 6 consciously uses the terms \"person\", \"promoter\", or \"a person having control over the company\", and does not use the term \"acquirer\", as the term \"acquirer\" has been given, as noticed below, a specific legal meaning by the 1997 Takeover Regulations. Regulation 7, on the other hand, expressly uses the term \"acquirer\". 42. When we turn to Regulation 8 which deals with \"continuous disclosures\", the regulation uses the term \"person\", \"promoter\", and \"every person having control over the company\", which are the terms used in Regulation 6. Regulation 8 stipulates every person, which includes the person mentioned in Regulation 6, who hold more than 15% shares of voting rights as on 31st March shall make a disclosure to the company within 21 days from the end of the financial year. There is a similar stipulation in sub-regulation (2) to Regulation 8 which requires a promoter or every person having control over a company to make a disclosure within 21 days from the end of the financial year, as well as the record date of the company for declaration of dividend, to make a disclosure of the number and percentage of shares or voting rights held by him and by persons acting in concert with him in that company to the company. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The expression \"person acting in concert\" has been defined in clause (e) of Regulation 2(1) of the Regulations, which clause has been examined and interpreted by us subsequently, also finds reference in the expression \"acquirer\" defined by clause (b) in Regulation 2 to the 1997 Takeover Regulations. 44. Every company whose shares are listed in the stock exchange is mandated by Regulation 8(3) to make a disclosure to all stock exchanges where their shares are listed, within 30 days of the end of the financial year as well as the record date for the purpose of declaration of dividend as to the holdings of the persons covered by sub-regulations (1) and (2) of Regulation 8. Regulation 8( 4) states that every company, whose shares are listed, shall maintain a register in the specified format to record the information received under sub-regulation (3) to Regulation 6, sub-regulation (1) to Regulation 7 and sub-regulation (2) to Regulation 8. 45. The expression \"acquirer\", as defined in the 1997 Takeover Regulations, is broad, wide and is given an expansive definition. An \"acquirer\" is a person who directly or indirectly acquires or agrees to acquire shares or control over the target company by himself or with any person acting in concert with him. The phrase \"directly or indirectly\" as well as the expressions \"acquired shares or voting rights\" and \"with any person acting in concert with the acquirer\" underlines the extensive and widespread ambit of the term \"acquirer\". The term \"acquirer\" is not restricted to the person or individual shareholder as it encompasses any other person acting in concert with the \"acquirer\". 46. The expression \"person acting in concert\" as defined in clause (e) of Regulation 2( 1) is again broad and expansive. The expression \"person acting in concert\" as per sub-clause (1) of clause (e) includes a person, who for a common object or for purpose of substantial acquisition of shares, voting rights, gaining control over the company, pursuant to an agreement or understanding formal or informal, directly or indirectly, cooperate by acquiring or agreeing to acquire shares or voting rights in a target company or to take control over a target company. Sub-clause (2) of clause (e) of Regulation 2(1) incorporates legal fiction as it states that the persons enumerated in clauses (i) to (x) shall be deemed to be persons acting in concert with other persons in the same category. The Note to clause (e) of Regulation 2(1) explains the expression \"associate\" as a relative of the person within the meaning of Section 6 of the Companies Act, 1956, family trust and Hindu Undivided Families. However, the presumption raised vide sub-clause (2) of Regulation 2(1)(e) is qualified and subject to - \"unless the contrary is established\". Therefore, if the contrary is established, the presumption raised vide clauses (i) to (x) may not apply in entirety or only apply in part limited to specific shareholder(s) or the persons mentioned in clauses (i) to (x) who in concert acquire shares or voting rights of a target company. The factual matrix is determinative as clause (e) vide sub-clause (1) of Regulation 2(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations lays down a derivative or spin-off rule of interpretation, and even when the presumption under sub-clause (2) arises, the adjudicator will not apply the presumption when the fact to the contrary are ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The presumption is to be looked as \"the bats of law, flitting in the twilight but disappearing in the sunshine of facts\" .18 47. The object of the aforesaid wide definitions is to ensure that no one is able to dribble past and defeat the 1997 Takeover Regulations by resorting to camouflage and subterfuge. 48. Interpreting Regulation 10 the Appellate Tribunal in Madhuri S. Pitti2 , by referring to their earlier decision in Sunil Krishna Khaitan 1, has opined: (Madhuri S. Pitti case2 , SCC OnLine SAT paras 21-23) \"21. The first ingredient of the Regulation in question is \"acquirer\", the second is \"shares or voting rights, if any, held by him or by persons acting in concert with him\"; and the third is \"entitle such acquire to exercise fifteen per cent or more of the voting rights in a company\". The definitions of \"acquirer\" and \"persons acting in concert\" as given in the Code of Conduct, 1997 are reproduced below for the sake of convenience: '2. (l)(b) \"acquirer\" means any person who, directly or indirectly, acquires or agrees to acquire shares or voting rights in the target company, or acquires or agrees to acquire control over the target company, either by himself or with any person acting in concert with the acquirer; (e) \"person acting in concert\" comprises- (1) persons who, for a common objective or purpose of substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights or gaining control over the target company, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (formal or informal), directly or indirectly cooperate by acquiring or agreeing to acquire shares or voting rights in the target company or control over the target company. (2) Without prejudice to the generality of this definition, the following persons will be deemed to be persons acting in concert with other persons in the same category, unless the contrary is established:' 22. A simple reading of the definition of the word \"acquirer\" makes it clear that an acquirer may act alone or as part of a group of persons acting in concert. On the other hand, the definition of \"persons acting in concert\" reveals that people who cooperate with each other in order to acquire substantial voting rights in a particular company would be considered persons acting in concert. At this point, we find it necessary to quote para 31 from Sunil Krishna Khaitan v. SEB/1 decided on 19-6-2013 mentioned herein below: (SCC OnLine SAT para 31) '31. In this connection, it may also be pertinently noted that the SAST Regulations, 1997 allow certain persons/entities to act in concert for the purpose of acquisition. Even the definition of \"persons acting in concert\" as provided in Regulation 2(l)(e)(l) clearly provides 18 Words from the Full Bench decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in G. Vasu v.

SUNIL KRISHNA KHAITAN (Sanjiv Khanna, J.) 673 that this expression includes persons who agree to cooperate with each other to acquire shares/voting rights in a target company or control over the target company pursuant to a formal or informal understanding between them, directly or indirectly. Thus, the definition is wide enough and gives ample scope to persons to act in concert as one unit for the purpose of acquisition of shares/voting rights. Further, Regulation 2(1)(e)(2) also enumerates various persons who could act in concert and they, inter alia, include a company, its holding company, a subsidiary, Directors, mutual fund with sponsor or trustee, foreign institutional investors, merchant bankers, so on and so forth. In this context, if we look at the new SAST Regulations, 2011, we note that Regulation 3(3) specifically provides that acquisition of shares by any person within the meaning of Regulations 3( 1) and 3(2) would be attracting the obligation to make an open offer for acquiring shares of the target company irrespective of its aggregate shareholding with persons acting in concert if the shareholding of such individual person exceeds the threshold limit prescribed by Regulation 10. It is pertinent to note that such a specific and unambiguous provision making an individual liable to make a public offer in case the individual shareholding increases during the course of the acquisition even while acting in concert with other persons is conspicuously missing in the SAST Regulations, 1997. KLL was, therefore, not required to make a public off er and the finding in the impugned order qua Appellant 3 i.e. KLL is hereby set aside. At any rate, since the amendment of the Takeover Code and the inclusion of Regulation 3(3) in the SAST Regulations, 2011 the discussion regarding the applicability of Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations, 1997 has been rendered academic. Having said that, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, KLL cannot be called upon to make an open offer by applying Regulation 3(3) of the new Takeover Code retrospectively.' 23. Therefore, it is evident that the framers of the 1997 Takeover Regulations intended to bring out a clear distinction between individual acquiring of shares on one hand and shares acquired by persons acting in concert on the other. The benchmark of 15% would, thus, apply to an individual when the individual is acquiring shares/voting rights on his behalf alone. Similarly, when we attempt to determine whether or not the said limit has been crossed, shareholdings of all members of the group of persons acting in concert would have to be reckoned as a whole. Any other interpretation which would serve to dilute the distinction between an individual acquirer and a group of \"persons acting in concert\" as an acquirer. It would, indeed, make the concept of \"persons acting in concert\" nugatory, which could never have been the intention of the law makers. We, therefore, find Appellant 3 free of any blame with respect to provisions of Regulation 10 of the SAST Regulations, 1997 regarding his acquisitions in the years 2006 and 2007.\" (emphasis in original and supplied) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Regulation 10 states that no \"acquirer\" shall acquire voting rights, which taken together with the shares or voting rights held by him or by a \"person acting in concert\" would entitle the a \"acquirer\" to exercise 15 % or more of the voting rights in the company, unless such \"acquirer\" makes public announcement to acquire shares in accordance with the regulations. The word \"acquirer\" used in Regulation 10 takes its meaning from the definition clause (b) of Regulation 2(1), which refers to the shareholder as an individual and also \"person acting in concert\" with him, which expression has been very widely defined vide clause (e) of Regulation b 2( 1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. The Appellate Tribunal has, therefore, rightly held that the word \"acquirer\", which is a term of art19, should not be restricted to shares or voting rights of the individual shareholder as the term as defined includes the \"person acting in concert\" with the shareholder. The shareholding/voting rights of the \"acquirer\", that is, the individual shareholder together with the \"person acting in concert\" decides whether the \"acquirer\" c is required to make a public offer/announcement in terms of Regulation 10, which applies when the voting rights of the \"acquirer\" before acquisition were less than 15%, but on fresh acquisition exceed 15% of the voting rights in the company. Regulation 10 does not apply when the collective voting rights of the individual shareholder and the \"person acting in concert\", taken together is 15% or more on the date when fresh shares or voting rights are acquired. d The bracketed portion of Regulation 10, namely, \"taken together with shares or voting rights, if any, held by him or by persons acting in concert with him\" affirms and endorses this interpretation. 50. When a word/term has been defined in a statute in a particular manner then the interpreter can assume the word/term must be understood in the stipulated sense. The principle applies with greater vigour when the definition e of the word/term is given a legal and substantive meaning, different from the common meaning, as then the writer demands that the reader should understand the term/word in the sense defined. When the content and meaning given is technical, the interpreter is entitled to infer that the intention of the draftsmen is to deviate and depart from the ordinary, literal or customary meaning. Therefore, when a statutory enactment consciously defines a word or f expression by enlarging or restricting the ordinary meaning, in the absence of clear indication to the contrary, the term as defined shall cover what is proposed, authorised, done or referred to in the enactment. 20 This principle can be also discarded when the definition read and applied would not agree with the subject and context thereby making the provision unworkable or otiose. 19 Lord Nicholls has defined the phrase \"term of art\" in a legal sense as a term with one specific and precise meaning for the purposes of the enactment-see Brooks v. g Brooks, 1996 AC 375: (1995) 3 WLR 141 (HL) h 20 Lord Lowry, Wyre Forest District Council v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h SEBI v. SUNIL KRISHNA KHAITAN (Sanjiv Khanna, J.) 675 51. In the context of Regulation I 0, we do not think that the draftsmen had committed a mistake or had forgotten the definition clauses while wording Regulation 10, wherein they have consciously used the expression \"acquirer\", after having defined the same, instead of the word a \"person\", which word has been used in Regulations 6 and 8 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. To accept the interpretation given by the Board, we would have to stretch the language of Regulation 10 and not read it as it reads, by assuming that the intent is to apply Regulation 10 in two situations (i) when the acquirer as a single entity, without taking into consideration the shareholding or voting rights of the person(s) acting in concert; as well as (ii) when the single entity together with the person(s) acting in concert, acquire voting rights, and in either case to cross the stipulation of 15% of the voting rights. But this would require us to ignore or rewrite the word \"acquirer\" which as defined includes the \"person(s) acting in concert\". It defeats the object and purpose behind the \"term of art\" definition. Regulation 10 applies to the \"acquirer\" acquiring voting rights, with reference to the existing holding as a person and in concert with other persons, because the acquisition is to be \"taken together with shares or voting rights held by the acquirer himself or by person acting in concert with him\". The combined holding of the person and the \"person acting in concert\" determines application of Regulation 10. If an \"acquirer\" already holds more than 15 % shares or voting rights in concert with other persons, such holding is not to be fragmented to calculate the shares or voting rights of the \"acquirer\" in his personal capacity under Regulation 10. 52. The language and the wording of Regulation 10 clearly differs from the language and wording of Regulation 11(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. In Regulation 11(1), an acquirer, either himself or through or with any person acting in concert with him, has 15% or more but less than 55% shares/voting rights, is required to make a public announcement in accordance with the Regulation when he, either by himself or through or with persons acting in concert with him, acquire additional shares or voting rights entitling him to exercise more than 5 % of the voting shares in addition to already acquired shares/voting rights. 53. Thus Regulation 10 does not apply when the \"acquirer\" already holds more than 15% shares or voting rights in the target company. The \"acquirer\", for the purpose of the said Regulation, not only means the individual person but also the \"person acting in concert\" with the individual person. In such cases, Regulation 11(1) may apply when the \"acquirer\" who holds between 15% to 55% of shares or voting rights, post the acquisition of the additional shares or voting rights is entitled to exercise more than 5% of the voting rights. 54. The contention of the Board that the interpretation by the Appellate Tribunal defeats the object and purpose of the 1997 Takeover Regulations is a feeble and evanescent argument. The interpretation, does not render Regulation 10 ineffective to deal with cases where an individual, parts ways with the \"person(s) acting in concert\" to acquire shares beyond the threshold of 15% with the intend to gain control or stake in the target company. The argument overlooks the wording of Regulations 2(1)(b) and (e). A \"person acting in concert\" as defined in clause (e) of Regulation 2(1) is a fluctuating and not a fixed body of persons.

Definitions of the terms, \"acquirer\" and \"person acting in concert\" are situation and fact specific. The legal fiction vide sub-clause (2) to Regulation 2(l)(e), specifically stipulates, unless contrary is established. Yes, there could be situations when the \"person(s) acting in concert\" holding more than 15% voting rights post the said acquisition may part ways, but Regulation 10 is not attracted and applicable to such situations. To argue that public shareholders can predict such events and therefore the Board's interpretation is more acceptable is imaginative but an uncompelling and a weak argument. 55. Risk-taking is essential to an active market, and in fact the securities market thrives on legitimate changes in management, flexibility and willingness to accept change, which may not be predictable. Good regulation, it is said, should promote and allow for the effective management of risk and not stifle risk-taking. Regulator should ensure that capital and other prudential requirements are sufficient to address appropriate risk-taking, and check excessive risk-taking. 21 Therefore, the apprehension of the Board, which is more in the nature of scepticism and qualm, is misconceived and should be rejected. 56. There is ample material, and it is accepted by the Board that they had read the expression \"acquirer\" in Regulation 10 to mean and include the shareholder along with \"person acting in concert\". Meaning thereby, there would not be any violation of Regulation 10 if the \"acquirer\", which would include the \"person acting in concert\", acquires new shares or voting rights when he individually or along with the \"person in concert\", already holds more than 15% shares in the target company. This interpretation was accepted and even communicated by the Board to third parties. Adjudicating officer(s) have accepted this interpretation and dropped penalty proceedings, which orders have attained finality and accepted by the Board. 57.

Thus, the Board as well as the adjudicating officer have treated the expression \"acquirer\", for the purpose of Regulation 10, to include a \"person acting in concert\" and the combined shareholding were taken into consideration for deciding whether there was a breach of Regulation 10. Where the \"acquirer\", including the \"person acting in concert\", already had shares or voting rights in excess of the prescribed limit, they were not held guilty of violating Regulation 1022 . 59. It is important for the regulator to be consistent and predictable. Further regulations must be clear as ambiguous regulations cause confusion and uncertainty. Regularity and predictability, along with certainty, are hallmarks of good regulation and governance. These principles underpin the \"rule of law\", check arbitrariness and are read as the intent of the legislation, which the Courts, if need be, will enforce as a principle of interpretation. The Board is entrusted to preform legislative, executive, investigative and adjudicatory functions. A regulator when it executes statutory functions interprets the enactment and gives meaning and, in that sense, lays down what it believes is the rule. As a legislator who constructs and states at the first instance what is the rule, the Board tacitly promises and prophesies the interpretation that appeals to them. Any good regulatory system must promote and adhere to principle of certainty and consistency, providing assurance to the individual as to the consequence of transactions forming part of his daily affairs. 23 Lord Diplock has aptly said \"unless men know what the rule of conduct is they cannot regulate their actions to confirm to it\". Otherwise the regulator \"fails in its primary function as a rule maker\". 24 This does not mean that the regulator/ authorities cannot deviate from the past practice, albeit any such deviation or change must be predicated on greater public interest or harm. This is the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution of India which requires fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in essence and substance. Therefore, 22 Under sub-section (3) to Section 15-I, the Board has the power to ca11 for and examine records of any proceedings if it considers the order passed by the adjudicating officer is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interests of the securities market and after causing or making an inquiry pass an order enhancing the quantum of penalty if the circumstances of the case so justify. The second proviso states that an order under sub-section (3) can be passed by the Board after expiry of period of three months from the date of the order passed by the adjudicating officer or disposal of the appeal under Section 15-T, whichever is earlier. 23 Union of India v.

SUNIL KRISHNA KHAITAN (Sanjiv Khanna, J.) 679 to examine the question of inconsistency, the analysis is to ascertain the need and functional value of the change, as consistency is a matter of operational effectiveness. Sometimes changes are desirable and necessary. Referring to these aspects, in some cases, the Indian courts have applied the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation25 observing that the change in policy should not be irrational or perverse or one which no reasonable person could have made. In other words, principles of Wednesbury's reasonableness would apply. Such a principle stems, but is somewhat different from the foundational idea of procedural legitimate expectation, which applies where a particular mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no impediment in adopting the procedure, the deviation to act in similar manner without any reasonable principle, can be labelled as arbitrary. 26 60. In Punjab Communications Ltd. v. Union of India 27 , it is observed that for a legitimate expectation to arise, the decisions of the administrative authority must affect the person by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which he had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy, and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until he has been communicated some rational grounds for withdrawing it and he has been given an opportunity to comment. It also means that the assurance given by the decision-maker will not be withdrawn, without giving him an opportunity of advancing reasons to contend that they should not be withdrawn. Reference can also be made to a recent decision of this Court in State of Jharkhand v. Brahmputra Metallics Ltd. 28 wherein reference was made to earlier judgment in National Buildings Construction Corpn. v. S. Raghunathan29 to reiterate that claims based on legitimate expectations have been held to acquire reliance on the representations and resulting detriment to the complainant in the same way as claims based on promissory estoppel. 61. In the context of the present case, it is to be noted that the Board is the draftsman of the legislation having enacted the 1997 Takeover Regulations and hence, their interpretation and understanding of the Regulations is of importance and relevance. In the context of the present case, the Board, nearly 25 See, Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for Civil Service, 1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 WLR 1174 (HL), wherein it was observed in that case that for a legitimate expectation to arise, the decisions of the administrative authority must affect the person by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there has been communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-maker that they will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn. 26 Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd. v.

Past is passe and not present, and by giving \"retroactive\" operation without good reason and ground30, the direction violates fundamental notions of predictability and legal stability. 31 62. We also feel that the principle of doubtful penalisation would be applicable in the present case. Way back in 1955, this Court in Tolaram Relumal v. State of Bombay32 had held that it is a well-settled rule of construction of penal statutes that if two views and reasonable constructions can be put on a provision, the court must lean in favour of construction which exempts the subject from penalty rather than one which imposes penalty. 33 63. In Bipinchandra Parshottamdas Patel v. State of Gujarat34, a three- Judge Bench of this Court had referred to this principle and quoted the following passage from Mohd. Ali Khan v. CWT3 5, which reads: (Mohd. Ali Khan case35 , SCC p. 514, para 6) \"6. It is a cardinal principle of construction that the words of a statute are first understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense and phrases and sentences are construed according to their grammatical meaning unless that leads to some absurdity or unless there is something in the context or in the object of the statute to suggest the contrary. It has been often held that the intention of the legislature is primarily to be gathered from the a b C d e 30 See our findings below. 31 Mathew P. Harrington, Foreword: The Dual Dichotomy of Retroactive Lawmaking. 32 (1955) 1 SCR 158: AIR 1954 SC 496 33 Id, AIR pp. 498-99, para 8: \"8. The question that needs our determination in such a situation is whether Section 18(1) makes punishable receipt of money at a moment of time when f the lease had not come into existence, and when there was a possibility that the contemplated lease might never come into existence. It may be here observed that the provisions of Section 18(1) are penal in nature and it is a well- settled rule of construction of penal statutes that if two possible and reasonable constructions can be put upon a penal provision, the court must lean towards that construction which exempts the subject from penalty rather than the one which imposes penalty. It is not competent to the court to stretch the meaning g of an expression used by the legislature in order to carry out the intention of the legislature.

As a consequence a construction which requires for its support addition or substitution of words or which results in rejection of words as meaningless has to be avoided. Obviously the aforesaid rule of construction is subject to exceptions. Just as it is not permissible to add words or to fill in a gap or lacuna, similarly it is of universal application that effort should be made to give meaning to each and every word used by the legislature.\" 64. Reference in Bipinchandra case34 was thereafter made to Francis Bennion' s Statutory Interpretation which observes that the principle of doubtful penalisation, often limited to criminal statutes, in fact, extends to any form of detriment. The jurist has opined that it is a principle of legal policy that a person should not be penalised except under clear law. We, when considering in relation to the facts of the instant case, wherein the opposing constructions of the enactment is possible, should presume that the legislature intended to observe this principle. The courts, therefore, try to avoid adopting a construction which penalises a person where the legislature's intention to do so is doubtful. 65. We would quote Section 278 from Bennion on Statutory Interpretation, 5th Edn., Indian Reprint, which reads as under: \"278. Statutory interference with economic interests.- One aspect of the principle against doubtful penalisation is that by the exercise of State power the property or other economic interests of a person should not be taken away, impaired or endangered, except under clear authority of law.\" 66. In the comments in Section 278 of the treatise, it is stated that the presumption against imposition of statutory detriment to a person's property or other economic interest has been recognised and explained in Entick v. Carrington 36 by Brat, C.J. in the following words: \"The great end for which men entered into society was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances where it has not been abridged by some public law for the good of the whole.\" 67. The principle of doubtful penalisation has limited value when interpreting beneficial or remedial statutes where the adjudicator may adopt a liberal and a purposive interpretation. 37 The principle can be ignored when other interpretative factors, like interest of public law and good of the society, 34 Bipinchandra Parshottamdas Patel v.

Only then the court can interpret and give meaning which the legislature wanted to achieve and convey. b 68. We have already, while referring to the principle of legitimate expectation, referred to the exceptions when the court may not apply the said principle. 69. The Board has drawn our attention to the decision of this Court in Swedish Match6 wherein S.B. Sinha, J., who is also the author of the judgment in Bipinchandra34 , had not applied the principle of doubtful penalisation with c reference to Regulation 11 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. The Hon'ble Judge in Swedish Match6 has explained that in the said case there was a clear violation and failure on the part of the persons statutorily obliged to comply with the imperative statutory provisions. With reference to this decision, the Board had referred to one line in para 7740 of Swedish Match6 which refers to 38 See R. v.

With a view to advert to the question, the admitted facts may be noticed: Swedish Match Singapore agreed to acquire majority shareholding in Haravon and Seed subsequent to 17-12-1997 wherefor the public offer was made. SMS comprising Haravon and Seed had 28.28% and 10.33% whereas the Jatia Group comprising AVP and Plash had 5% and 15% respectively whereas public/others had 41.39% shares.

SUNIL KRISHNA KHAITAN (Sanjiv Khanna, J.) 683 Regulation 10 and states that the same would apply as no public announcement was made in its compliance. It is to be noted that Regulation 10 was not invoked by the Board in Swedish Match6 and its violation was not alleged. In the subject appeal before this Court in Swedish Match 6 , reliance was placed on Regulation 12 to get over the mandate of Regulation 11, which contention was rejected. One stray sentence in para 77 that Regulation 10 would apply should not be read as ratio decidendi of the said decision and as a finding on the interpretation of Regulation 10.41 Decision dated 25-7-2012 of the Appellate Tribunal in Hanumesh Realtors (P) Ltd. v. SEB/42 is per incuriam as it has referred to the decision in Swedish Match6 , which decision relates to and interprets Regulation 11(1). In the present reasoning, we are not dealing and interpreting Regulation 11(1) but Regulation 10 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. (Footnote 40 contd.) Wimco the shares held by public/others came down to 23.78%. Both the Swedish Group and the Jatia Group were exercising joint control. By reason of the Jatia Group opting out of the joint control by transfer of shares in favour of Swedish Match Singapore, a subsidiary of Swedish Match AB (a part of the Swedish Match Group) obtained 74% of shares whereas Haravon - 46.18%, Seed - 5.93% and SMS - 21.89% . Thus, the extent of shares of the Jatia Group came down to 2.22%. The Jatia Group sold its shares to the public as a result whereof shares of the public became 23.78%. SMS is a subsidiary of the Singapore Match Group. Swedish Match is the holding company being the owner of 100% shares of SMS . It stands categorically admitted by the appe11ants herein that acquisition of shares from the Jatia Group in favour of SMS was done by the Swedish company as a group and not as an individual company. Factually, therefore, it is not correct to contend, although in its notice dated 28-1-2002, SEBI had given indication thereof, that SMS had acquired 21.89% shares of its own. Even if SMS had done so, Regulation 10 would apply as no public announcement was made therefor.\" [Swedish Match, (2004) 11 sec 641, p. 665, para 77] 6 Swedish MatchAB v.

The contention of the Board that there is no estoppel against law is well known, but the said principle is not applicable for several reasons. First, the interpretation accepted by the Appellate Tribunal is not only plausible but more acceptable than the interpretation propounded by the Board. Secondly, the Board, which has the power to enact the Regulations, interpret and apply them, adjudicate and also pass a penalty order in case of violation for good and substantial reasons had interpreted regulations in the same manner in earlier instances as interpreted by the Appellate Tribunal. Thirdly, the adjudication orders in the present case were passed well after the 1997 Takeover Regulations were repealed with the enactment and enforcement of the 2011 Takeover Regulations. In the present case, therefore, we are dealing with a legacy issue. Regulation 10 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations, as interpreted and applied by the Board for over ten years, is sought to be overturned by the Board, thereby, creating penal consequences. This should not be permitted and is hardly acceptable when we apply the principle of good governance and regulation. 71. The argument of the Board that the 2011 Takeover Regulations are retrospective is to be only noted and rejected. The impugned order passed by the Appellate Tribunal in Madhur S. Pitti2 specifically records that the Board had conceded that the 2011 Takeover Regulations do not have any retrospective application. 43 The contention that the 2011 Takeover Regulations are clarificatory and, therefore, retrospective is ex facie fallacious and untenable. Regulation 3(3) of the 2011 Takeover Regulations specifically postulate as under: \"3. Substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights.-(l)-(2) * * * (3) For the purposes of sub-regulation (1) and sub-regulation (2), acquisition of shares by any person, such that the individual shareholding of such person acquiring shares exceeds the stipulated thresholds, shall also be attracting the obligation to make an open offer for acquiring shares of the target company irrespective of whether there is a change in the aggregate shareholding with persons acting in concert.\" 72. In the aforesaid background, on the enforcement of the 2011 Takeover Regulations, it is clear that Regulation 10 will apply on an acquirer who crosses the threshold of 15%, which under the 2011 Takeover Regulations, 2 Madhuri S. Pitti v. SEBI, 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 100 43 \"27. We agree with the respondent to the extent that the SEBI Act is certainly a social welfare legislation. But this does not take away from the undeniable fact that Regulation 3(3) of the SAST Regulations, 2011 introduced the provision stating that even in case of an individual's shareholding crossing the stipulated threshold, which is now 25%, the need to make a public offer shall arise. The respondent has in all fairness has agreed that the new Takeover Code of 2011 does not apply retrospectively.\" (SCC OnLine SAT para 27) We may observe that SEBI Act is not a social welfare legislation but an eco-legal legislation and, therefore, must be interpreted pragmatically taking into account the commercial practices, interest of the investors/shareholders and also without ignoring the difficulties of the persons in control of the company. Competing interests, rights and obligations have to be balanced. a b C d e f g h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Further, Regulation 10 would apply both when an individual acquirer or an acquirer in concert with others acquires shares or voting rights beyond the threshold level and such an acquirer would have to comply with the applicable regulation. The 1997 Takeover Regulations and the 2011 Takeover Regulations, therefore, postulate different preconditions and thresholds. Reliance placed upon the Takeover Regulatory Advisory Committee Report would show that there was a rethought and re-examination of Regulation 10 pursuant to which Regulation 3(3) was enacted and made a part of the regulatory mechanism under the 2011 Takeover Regulations. 73. It is a general rule of law of interpretation that unless explicitly mentioned, a law cannot be presumed to be retrospective. In CIT v. Vatika Township (P) Ltd. 44, a Constitution Bench decision, this Court observed that: (SCC pp. 21-22, paras 28-29) \"28. Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to be interpreted, one established rule is that unless a contrary intention appears, a legislation is presumed not to be intended to have a retrospective operation. The idea behind the rule is that a current law should govern current activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the events of the past. If we do something today, we do it keeping in view the law of today and in force and not tomorrow's backward adjustment of it .... 29. The obvious basis of the principle against retrospectivity is the principle of ''fairness\", which must be the basis of every legal rule as was observed in L 'Office Cherifien des Phosphates v. Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. Ltd. 45 Thus, legislations which modified accrued rights or which impose obligations or impose new duties or attach a new disability have to be treated as prospective unless the legislative intent is clearly to give the enactment a retrospective effect; unless the legislation is for purpose of supplying an obvious omission in a former legislation or to explain a former legislation.\" (emphasis in original) 74. Further, in the absence of express statutory authorisation, delegated legislation in the form of rules or regulations, cannot operate retrospectively.46 Certainly, Regulation 3(3) in the 2011 Takeover Regulations clarified and possibly removed the shortcoming of the 1997 Regulations. However, the language of Regulation 3(3) as reproduced above is apparently not of clarificatory or declaratory nature.47 44 (2015) 1 sec 1 45 (1994) 1 AC 486: (1994) 2 WLR 39 (HL) 46 Excise Commr. v.

The impugned order in Sunil Krishna Khaitan case 1 dismisses the a appeal preferred by the respondents and thereby affirms the order holding the respondents guilty of violation of Regulation 11 (1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. The respondents have not filed appeals or cross-objections challenging the said finding of the Appellate Tribunal. Hence, we are not required to and would not comment on the findings recorded by the Appellate Tribunal on violation of Regulation 11(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. b We proceed on the basis that the respondents are guilty and have failed to make public announcement within stipulated timeline as per the 1997 Takeover Regulations. 76.

Use of the word \"may\" over the years is normally construed as permissive and not imperative. The words \"may\" or \"shall\" by their very etymological foundation denote discretion and mandatory nature of an act respectively. This Court has, therefore, held that the courts should not readily interpret the word \"may\" as \"shall\" unless such interpretation is necessary to avoid absurdity, inconvenient consequences or as mandated by the intent of the legislature which is gathered from the other parts of the statute. 52 52 See Official Liquidator v.

It is not mandatory that in case of every violation and breach of Regulations 10, 11 and 12, direction under Regulation 44 shall be issued. The interpretation gets a fortified in view of the words and object of the Regulation 44 which empowers the Board to issue directions as it deems fit. Section 11 (1 ), while broadly defining the functions of the Board, states that it is the duty of the Board to protect interest of investors in securities and to promote the development of, and regulate the securities market by such measures as it thinks fit. Section 11-B, which deals with the power of the Board to give directions, states that the Board, b after making or causing an inquiry, may issue directions if it is satisfied that it is necessary in the interest of the investors, or orderly development of the securities market; to prevent the affairs of any intermediary or other persons referred to in Section 12 from conducting affairs in a manner detrimental to the interest of the investors or to secure proper management of such intermediary or persons. Section 11(2)(h) provides that the Board is entitled to take measures c for regulating substantial acquisition of shares and takeover of companies. Regulation 44 states that the Board while issuing directions, has to keep in mind the interest of the securities market and its role as a protector of interest of investors. We will read the word \"or\" between the expression \"in the interest of securities market or protection of investors\" as \"and\". The Board, therefore, when it decides to exercise its power under Regulation 44 and issues directions d under the said Regulation has to keep the two facets in mind, namely, (i) interest of the securities market; and (ii) protection of interest of the investors. The exercise of discretion of the Board, in fact, would not be restricted to the two facets mentioned above as the power and functions of the Board are far broader as they include promotion, development and regulation of securities market as a whole and regulating substantial acquisition of shares and takeover of e companies. 82. Discretion is an effective and an important tool which the legislature confers and vests with the executive for effective and good governance, administration, and in the present case - regulation, of the securities market which has complex commercial and economic facets. Therefore, the law provides an option to the Board and the authorities to adopt one or the other f alternatives. However, this does not mean that the Board or the authorities enjoy unfettered and unchecked discretionary jurisdiction to act according to private or personal opinion in a vague and fanciful manner. 53 Discretion, when of wide amplitude, and when it can have civil and penal consequences, must be exercised in a legal and regular manner. 54 Exercise of discretion is always governed by rules, which means that the exercise of discretion should be fair g and reasonable as the legislature while conferring discretion never intends that the authorities would not act whimsically, arbitrarily, but on the precept that they shall act only when it appears to be necessary in public interest. 55 Legal 53 Susannah Sharp v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf a b C d e f g h SEBI v. SUNIL KRISHNA KHAITAN (Sanjiv Khanna, J.) 691 exercise of discretion is one, where the authority examines and ascertains the facts, is aware of the law, and then decides objectively and rationally what serves the interest better. This is true even when the statutes are silent and only the power is conferred to act in one way or the other. Reasonableness as a standard is tested by reference to the community standards at the time of exercise of discretion. This means that discretion should be exercised within the limit to which an honest man competent to discharge his office ought to confine himself. 56 It will be also true to state that the greater the harm or penal consequences, greater is the duty and obligation of the public authority to ensure that discretion is used as an effective tool in regulation or administration but does not cause confusion, chaos and instability. 83. In the context of Regulations 44 and 45, it implies that the Board has the power to make a choice between different courses of action or inaction. This choice is not unfettered but is always held subject to implied limitations inherent in every statute, limitations set by the common law and the constitutional mandate of rule of law. The underlying rationale of giving discretion is to ensure that the Board exercises the discretion in consonance with legitimate values of public law, which include need to maintain legal certainty and consistency which are at the heart of the principle of rule of law. 57 These have to be balanced with other equally legitimate public law value, which is the object and purpose of the enactment. The need for the said flexibility is given and is necessary to meet unusual and practical situations and to do justice in a particular case. 58 The remedial order passed by the Board as the regulator must also meet the said parameters in addition to meeting the requirements of the enactment. 84. Clearly, therefore, Regulation 44 differs from Section 15-H, which is somewhat a strict liability provision that applies if a person fails to comply with clauses (i) to (iv). It may be, however, noted that Section 15-H prescribes the lower as well as the higher monetary penalty limits. These stipulations have undergone modifications and changes from time to time. As per the amendments made by Act 59 of 2002, with retrospective effect from 29-10-2002, the penalty which can be imposed is not to be less than Rs 10,00,000 but may extend up to Rs 25,00,00,000 or three times the amount of profits made out of such failure, whichever is higher. The phase \"profits made out of such failure\" in Section 15-H indicates that while imposing quantum of penalty the authority should consider the profit made by the acquirer on account 56 Susannah Sharp v. Wakefield, 1891 AC 173 (HL): (AC p. 179) \" ... according to the rules of reason and justice, not according to private opinion; ... according to law and not humour.

Reference in this regard is also to be made to Section 15-1, which has been quoted above. It states that the person concerned has to be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard for the purpose of imposing any penalty. The adjudicating officer has the power to summon and enforce attendance of any person acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case to give evidence or produce documents which, in the opinion of the adjudicating officer, would be useful or relevant to the subject-matter of enquiry. Lastly, the adjudicating authority should be satisfied that the person has failed to comply with the provisions of the section specified in sub-section (1). 59 86. In this context, reliance placed by the Board on the judgments which relate to and arise from the orders passed by the adjudicating officer under Chapter VI-A of the Act are of no relevance, as Regulation 44 is a discretionary power and not mandatory in nature. Not only this, the directions under Regulation 44 are required to be issued considering relevant factors, including, interest of the securities market and protection of the investors in mind. Regulation 44 is not a strict liability provision. 87. The above position in law gets fortified from Regulation 45 which stipulates that any person violating a provision of the Regulations shall be liable in terms of the Regulation, that is, the 1997 Takeover Regulations and the Act. Sub-regulation (6) of Regulation 45, with reference to the penalties, states that it would include monetary penalties under Section 15-H of the Act. It may also include directions under the provisions of Sections 11-B and 11(4) of the Act. Further, there is power to issue cease and desist order in proceedings under Section 11-D of the Act. Criminal prosecution under Section 24 of the Act can also be initiated. Lastly, adjudicating proceedings under Section 15-H of the Act can be held. Therefore, the authorities have a right to take recourse to multiple proceedings which have been loosely classified and referred to as \"penalties\" in Regulation 45(6). Nowhere, however, Regulation 45 stipulates that in case of violation of Regulations I 0, 11 or 12 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations, the Board must initiate action and issue directions in terms of Regulation 44. The Board, in appropriate case, may take action under Regulation 44 and issue directions, but when it issues such directions, it must keep in mind the interest of securities market and to the protect the interests of the investors. Existence and conferment of power, and reasonable and legitimate exercise of the power in accordance with law are two different facets. 59 Sub-section (3) empowers the Board to call for and examine records of any proceedings under this section and if it considers the order passed by the adjudicating authority is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interest of the securities market, it may, after making or causing an inquiry to be made, pass an order enhancing the quantum of penalty. The order under sub-section (3) can a b C d e f g be passed within a period of three months from the date of order passed by the h adjudicating authority or disposal of the appeal under Section 15-T, whichever is earlier. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

We will now reproduce the order passed by the Whole-Time Member recording the reasons for issuing directions: \"31. In my view, the facts and circumstance of the case, do not suggest any reason to deviate from the normal rule of requirement of making public announcement in accordance with the 1997 Takeover Regulations as the same would be in the interest of the public shareholders of the Target Company. 32. In this case, since requisite public announcement has not been made by the noticees, KLL has contravened Regulation 10 and the promoter group has contravened Regulation 11 ( 1) as discussed above. I note that the 1997 Takeover Regulations have been repealed by the 2011 Takeover Regulations. In terms of Regulation 35(2)(b) of the 2011 Takeover Regulations, the obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed regulations, shall remain unaffected as if the repealed regulations has never been repealed. In the present case, the noticees triggered the obligation under Regulations 10 and 11(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations on 12-3-2007 and in terms of Regulation 14(1) thereof they were obligated to make requisite public announcement within 4 days from 12-3-2007. Thus, the noticees had incurred this obligation prior to repeal of the 1997 Takeover Regulations and the obligation has to be completed under the 1997 Takeover Regulations. 33. Since obligation under Regulations 10 and 11 both have overlapped in this case, as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Swedish Match case6, the noticees shall make a combined public announcement under Regulations 10 and 11 read with Regulation 14(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. 34. Had the noticees made the public announcement in accordance with the 1997 Takeover Regulations and complied all related activities within the timelines specified under the 1997 Takeover Regulations, all formalities with respect to their public announcement and the open offer would have been completed on 15-6-2007. Since the noticees have failed to make the public announcement within the stipulated time and the public announcement in compliance with this order would be after delay, the noticees shall pay interest on consideration amount as provided under the 1997 Takeover Regulations to the shareholders who tender their shares in the open offer and who are eligible for interest as per law. 35. I, therefore, in exercise of powers conferred upon me under Sections 19, 11 and 11-B of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 44 and 45 of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 read with Regulation 32(l)(h) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, hereby issue the following directions: (a) The noticees, Mr Sunil Krishan Khaitan, Mr Krishan Khaitan, Khaitan Lefin Ltd. and The Orientale Mercantile Company Ltd. shall make a combined public announcement to acquire shares of the Target Company, Khaitan Electricals Ltd., in terms of Regulations 10 and 11 ( 1) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997, within a period of 45 days from the date of this Order. (b) The noticees shall, along with consideration amount, pay interest @ 10% p.a., from 16-6-2007 to the date of payment of consideration, to the shareholders who were holding shares in the target company on the 6 Swedish Match AB v.

The Appellate Tribunal, on the other hand, has given the following reasons why the aforesaid directions were unacceptable and should be set aside: (Sunil Krishna Khaitan case 1, SCC OnLine SAT paras 35-37) \"35. In the instant case too, as a matter of undisputed fact, the promoter group has been in control of the Company since its very establishment in the year 1975. The appellants seem to have been aware of the implication of the limit of creeping acquisition of 5 % and, hence, did not breach Regulation 11 by letting some warrants lapse and not converting them into shares. In fact, the Tribunal notes that during the relevant period there were about 7 acquisitions but at no point of time did the appellants violate the provisions of any law but for the two conversions on 12-3-2007. We also note from the records that the appellants have invariably acted in a bona fide manner by keeping the stock exchanges concerned and the respondent informed regarding the true happenings with respect to the acquisitions of shares and the corresponding changes in the shareholding pattern. In this connection, the Tribunal has perused various corporate announcements made by the Company to the stock exchanges informing them about the allotment of equity shares as well as shareholding pattern as of March 2006, June 2006, September 2006 and December 2006. Letters dated 10-4-2006, 13-10-2006 and 11-4-2007, etc. are on record and have been perused by the Tribunal. 36. Similarly, it is noted that the two conversions of warrants on 12-3-2007, which were different transactions, inasmuch as the shares in the first tranche pertaining to 5 lakh shares allotted to the promoter group were allotted pursuant to conversion of warrants @ Rs 60 per share, and the shares in the second transaction consisting of 8 lakh warrants were converted @ Rs 131 per share. Although, the two spells were different, they were executed on the same date and the creeping acquisition limit of 5 % was clearly crossed in respect of the acquisition by the promoter group. Therefore, technically there is violation of Regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Code of 1997. For this violation, we are of the opinion that a suitable monetary penalty, must be imposed instead of calling upon the appellants to make a combined public announcement to acquire shares of the Company at this belated stage. The requirement of making a public announcement would be totally superfluous in the facts and circumstances of the case and would not beget any good. The objective of the preferential allotment of shares in question was only to address the working capital requirements of the Company for its smooth day-to-day functioning. Therefore, a stable, low-cost funding source, such as preferential allotment, was undertaken in the larger interests of the Company and, in effect, its shareholders. In this connection, it is pertinent to note that the allotment of preferential shares in question was made after seeking approval of the shareholders of the Company in two duly convened EGM' s held on 23-3-2006 and 29-11-2006. l Sunil Krishna Khaitan v.

The show-cause notice was issued by the respondent on 26-3-2012. After holding proceedings against the appellants, the impugned order came to be passed only on 31-12-2012. We note that there is an inordinate delay of about 5 years even in issuing the show-cause notice and no explanation has been offered for the same. The respondent was kept duly informed by the appellants of all the transactions/acquisitions in the year 2006-2007 along with information to other authorities concerned like various stock exchanges but no action was taken for the alleged violation for years together. Also, the point to be borne in mind while modifying the penalty imposed upon the appellants is that the securities market is a volatile and pulsating structure wherein events unfold at a staggeringly fast pace. We feel that to compel the appellants to make a combined public announcement to acquire shares today would be iniquitous and would lead to more harm than good for a mere technical fault, which in our opinion is remissible. Indeed, this Tribunal has taken a view consistently that in such cases of technical violation a monetary penalty could be imposed to serve the ends of justice keeping in view the factuality of a given situation.\" 90. We entirely agree with the reasoning given by the Appellate Tribunal for setting aside the directions given in the penultimate paragraph of the orders passed by the Whole-Time Member. As noticed above, the violation alleged in Appeal No. 23 of 2013 in Sunil Krishna Khaitan 1 relates to the years 2006-2007. The order issuing the directions was passed on 31-12-2012, nearly eight years after the alleged violation. The direction given is that the shareholders should be given an option to sell the shares held by them on 16-6-2007 by directing the respondents to make a public announcement to acquire the shares. Direction has also been given to pay interest @ 10% p.a. from 16-6-2007 till shares have been accepted in the open offer. The dividend paid, if any, would be adjusted. We are not stating that this direction can never be issued, but the exercise of discretion to issue the said directions has to be predicated and based upon good grounds and reasons. The directions of this nature are not automatic and are to be issued only when they are warranted and justified. The incongruities and absurdities of the directions issued have been highlighted and noticed in the order passed by the Appellate Tribunal. 91. The direction given by the Board vide letter dated 17-12-2012 in the case of Madhuri S. Pitti in the form of direction to modify the draft letter of offer submitted to the Board for approval on 19-9-2011 pursuant to the public announcement made by PLL on 9-9-2011, it must be stated, is rather odd and defies objectivity and logic. The Appellate Tribunal is right in noticing that there was lack of clarity on the part of the Board as to the provision under which the power has been exercised, as the Board's power under Regulation 18 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations is to specify changes, if any, in the letter of offer, without there being any obligation on the part of the Board to do so, and thereupon the merchant banker and the \"acquirer\" are required to carry out such changes before the letter of offer is despatched to the shareholders.

In this case, directions of the Board for amendment of the letter of offer was issued after a lapse of more than one year as the draft letter of offer was submitted on 19-9-2011 and the directions were issued vide letter dated 17-12-2012. Further, these directions were for the reason that the acquirer had failed to comply with Regulation 10 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations in the remote past, that is, in the year 2006 and 2007. Clearly, this is whimsical and arbitrary exercise of discretion by the Board which would have led to chaos and confusion. 92. This Court in the judgment authored by one ofus (Sanjiv Khanna, J.) in Bhavesh Pabari12 had examined the question of delay and laches in initiating proceedings under Chapter VI-A of the Act and the principle of law that when no limitation period is prescribed proceedings should be initiated within a reasonable time and what would be reasonable time would depend upon facts and circumstances of each case. In this regard, it was held as under: (SCC pp. 104-05, para 35) \"35. The appellants have also contended that in the absence of any prescribed limitation period, SEBI should have issued show-cause notice within a reasonable time and there being a delay of about 8 years in issuance of show-cause notice in 2014, the proceedings should have been dropped. This contention was not raised before the adjudicating officer in the written submissions or the reply furnished. It is not clear whether this contention was argued before the Appellate Tribunal. There are judgments which hold that when the period of limitation is not prescribed, such power must be exercised within a reasonable time. What would be reasonable time, would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of the default/ statute, prejudice caused, whether the third-party rights had been created, etc. The show-cause notice in the present case had specifically referred to the respective dates of default and the date of compliance, which was made between 30-8-2011 to 29-11-2011 (delay was between 927 days to 1897 days). Only upon compliance being made that the defaults had come to notice. In the aforesaid background, and so noticing the quantum of fine/ penalty imposed, we do not find good ground and reason to interfere.\" 93. The directions given in the aforesaid quotation should not be understood as empowering the authorities/Board to initiate action at any time. In the absence of any period of time and limitation prescribed by the enactment, every authority is to exercise power within a reasonable period. What would be the reasonable period would depend upon facts of each case, such as whether the violation was hidden and camouflaged and thereby the Board or the authorities did not have any knowledge. Though, no hard and fast rules can be laid down in this regard as determination of the question will depend on the facts of each case, the nature of the statute, the rights and liabilities thereunder and other consequences, including prejudice caused and whether third party rights have been created are relevant factors. Whenever a question with regard to inordinate delay in issuance of a show-cause notice is made, it is open to the noticee to 12 SEBT v.

SUNIL KRISHNA KHAITAN (Sanjiv Khanna, J.) 697 contend that the show-cause notice is bad on the ground of delay and it is the duty of the authority/officer to consider the question objectively, fairly and in a rational manner. There is public interest involved in not taking up and spending time on stale matters and, therefore, exercise of power, even when no time is specified, should be done within reasonable time. 60 This prevents miscarriage of justice, misuse and abuse of the power as well as ensures that the violation of the provisions are checked and penalised without delay, thereby effectuating the purpose behind the enactment. 94. We have already referred to Regulations 6, 7 and 8 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations which require the acquirer/shareholders to make disclosures to the company as well as to the stock exchange where the shares are listed. Violation of Regulations 6, 7 and 8 is not alleged. While it is true that the said disclosures and public notice of the disclosures cannot be treated as disclosure to the Board or authorities under the Act, the Board and the authorities, as a good regulator, cannot also claim complete ignorance. Significantly, in the present case, the investors of the target company have not raised any objection. The impugned order passed by the Whole-Time Member does not refer to any market manipulation or fluctuation in share price, which was detrimental to the interests of the investors. It is not the case of the Board that any windfall gains or profits have been made by the respondents on account of violation of Regulation 11 (1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. The order passed by the Whole-Time Member, in fact, does not take into account the impact of the order on the securities market in case the investors/shareholders in the target company as on 16-6-2007 are given an option to sell their shares on or after 31-12-2012, possibility of disruption on the functioning market place, detrimental impact on the market place/investor confidence, qualitative impact of the retroactive directions on the law's sanctity predicated on predictability and legal stability, as well as undermining of the people's faith and trust on the Board as the protector of law. The directions, therefore, cannot be sustained. 95. There is, as noticed and held below, some merit in the contention of the Board that the Appellate Tribunal could not have imposed penalty under Section 15-H when proceedings under the said section had not been invoked by the Board and there is no order passed by the adjudicating authority imposing penalty under Section 15-H of the Act. However, the effect of the argument raised by the Board would be that the order passed by the Whole-Time Member under Regulation 44 giving directions would be quashed and set aside. The respondents would have, therefore, escaped without having to pay any penalty for violation of Regulation 11 ( 1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. It is in this factual background we have to decide the present appeals. As noticed above, the respondents have not filed appeals or cross-objections challenging the penalty imposed by the Appellate Tribunal for violation of Regulation 11 ( 1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. 60 See State ofGujaratv.

We have briefly referred to the reasoning in the earlier paragraphs, and commented on the same. We have also reproduced the reasoning given by the Appellate Tribunal to substitute the direction of the Whole-Time Member with that of the penalty. 98. The appeal before the Appellate Tribunal under Section 15-T, is the first appeal against the decision of the Board or the adjudicating officer. First appeal is a continuation or is co-terminus with the proceedings of the original adjudicating authority. 63 The first appeal is a valuable right of the party aggrieved, and all questions of fact and law decided by the Board or the adjudicating authority, including exercise of discretion whether within the law, are open for full consideration and examination.64 The Appellate Tribunal, in the absence of any limit, has plenary powers in disposing of an appeal. 65 It can 63 See, CIT v.

The position as to the power of the Appellate Tribunal has been appropriately summarised in Swedish Match6 , wherein it has been held: (SCC p. 666, para 84) \"84. It may be true that the Board in its impugned order dated 4-6-2002 proceeded on a wrong premise that having regard to the proviso appended to Regulation 12, Regulation 12 would be attracted. But SAT, in our opinion, rightly construed66 the provisions of Regulations 11 and 12 in arriving at a finding that Regulation 11 would be attracted and Regulation 12 would not be. The Tribunal was entitled to take a different view of the matter from that of the Board with a view to sustain the ultimate result in the appeal in exercise of its appellate power. Such a power in the appellate court/tribunal is akin to or analogous to the principles contained in Order41 Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Even otherwise, before us the judgment of the Tribunal is in question, this Court is required to consider the correctness or otherwise of the Tribunal. In any event, the reasoning of the Tribunal shall prevail over the Board.\" (emphasis supplied) 99. In the context of the present appeal, it is to be noted that in Sunil Krishna Khaitan 1, an order in the form of directions under Regulation 44 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations was issued. It was this order which was made subject- matter of challenge before the Appellate Tribunal. Thus we do not accept the contention of the Board that the Appellate Tribunal while exercising appellate power could not have set aside and quashed the directions given in the appeal. 100. At the same time, in Sunil Krishna Khaitan case 1 proceedings under Section 15-H for levy of penalty were not initiated and no order of penalty under 15-H was passed by the adjudicating authority. The Appellate Tribunal, therefore, was not hearing an appeal against imposition of penalty under Section 15-H of the Act. Further, an order under Section 15-H of the Act is passed by an adjudicating authority which, while imposing penalty, is required to take into consideration the factors mentioned in Section 15-J.67 101. We have also referred to Regulation 45 which in sub-regulation (6) refers to different types of penalties which can be imposed on a person violating any of the provisions of the Regulations.

That power is vested with the authority specified in the Act or the Regulations. The Appellate Tribunal is an appellate forum and not the authority empowered to initiate penalty proceedings under Section 15-H or suo motu issue directions under Sections 11, 11-B or 11 ( 4 )( d) of the Act. It can uphold or set aside the direction issued, or modify and substitute the b direction issued under Regulation 44 of the 1997 Takeover Regulations read with Sections 11, 11-B and 11(4)(d) of the Act. Similarly, the Appellate Tribunal can uphold, set aside, modify and even substitute the order of penalty under Chapter VI-A of the Act. The power to initiate and levy penalty in terms of Section 15-I68 is vested with an officer to be appointed by the Board, not below the rank of Divisional Commissioner, to act as an adjudicating officer. c The adjudicating officer is required to hold an inquiry in the prescribed manner after giving the person a reasonable opportunity of being heard for the purpose of imposing any penalty.

(2) While holding an inquiry the adjudicating officer shall have power to summon and enforce the attendance of any person acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case to give evidence or to produce any document which in the opinion of the adjudicating officer, may be useful for or relevant to the subject- matter of the inquiry and if, on such inquiry, he is satisfied that the person has failed to comply with the provisions of any of the sections specified in sub-section (1), he may impose such penalty as he thinks fit in accordance with the provisions of any of those sections. (3) The Board may call for and examine the record of any proceedings under this section and if it considers that the order passed by the adjudicating officer is erroneous to the extent it is not in the interests of the securities market, it may, after making or causing to be made such inquiry as it deems necessary, pass an order enhancing the quantum of penalty, if the circumstances of the case so justify: Provided that no such order shall be passed unless the person concerned has been given an opportunity of being heard in the matter: Provided further that nothing contained in this sub-section shall be applicable after an expiry of a period of three months from the date of the order passed by the adjudicating officer or disposal of the appeal under Section 15-T, whichever is earlier.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Thus, the Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No. 23 of 2013 in Sunil Krishna Khaitan 1, could not have substituted the penalty imposed by the Board under Regulation 44 with that of penalty under Section 15-H. An appropriate a view, in our opinion, would be that when the Appellate Tribunal holds that the order passed by the Whole-Time Member on violation of Regulations I 0, 11 and 12 is sustainable, but the directions given in the order under Regulation 44 are not sustainable, it should leave it open to the Board to initiate proceedings and pass an order under Chapter VI-A of the Act. 103. However, as held above, in the absence of any cross-appeal or cross- b objection by the respondent in Sunil Krishna Khaitan case 1, we are not interfering with the order imposing penalty of Rs 25,00,000 for the violation of Regulation 11(1) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations. The said direction has attained finality. At the same time, we are inclined to direct that the Board would give quietus to the matter and should not initiate proceedings under Chapter VI-A of the Act. c 104. For the aforesaid reasons and grounds, the civil appeals preferred by the Board are dismissed with the clarification as to the power of the Appellate Tribunal under Section 15-T of Chapter VI-A of the Act, which is confined to examination of correctness and legality of the order under challenge. There will be no order as to costs. l Sunil Krishna Khaitan v. SEBT, 2013 SCC OnLine SAT 25 d e f g h","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
