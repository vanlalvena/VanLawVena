It is needless to stress that in a case like this the punishment has to be deterrent. There was in this case complete lack of candour on the part of the appellant in that he, in a frantic effort to save himself, procured false evidence. The evidence on record clearly shows that the appellant had taken money to pay a bribe to the radiologist. In a case of such grave professional misconduct, the State Bar Council observes that such practices adopted by the members of the bar bring the whole legal profession into disrepute and accord- ingly directed that the appellant be suspended from practice for a period of three years. The Disciplinary Committee has upheld the sentence saying that the penalty imposed does not appear to be excessive and rejected the plea of mercy observing : It is true that the appellant was a mere junior at the bar and not much experienced when the incident is said to have taken place. The temptation for money at that stage is of course very great but at the same time it is to be realised by the appellant that he belongs to a noble profession, which has very high tra, ditions and those traditions are not to be sullied by malpractices of this nature. Accordingly it declined to interfere with the punishment. We how- ever feel that the punishment of suspension from practice for a period of three years to a junior member of the bar like the appellant is rather severe. The lapse on the part of the appellant was perhaps due to the fact that in the struggle for existence he had to resort to such malpractices. We strongly deprecate the conduct of the appellant but take a lenient view because he was an inexperienced member of the bar, and the fact that the incidents took place in 1971. In all facts and circumstances of the case, we feel it would meet the ends of justice if we reduce the period of suspension from three years to one year. We order accordingly. 8. Subject to this modification, the appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs. (1983) -t Supreme Court Ca•ea 258 (BEFORE Y.V. CHANDRACHUD, C.J. AND R.S. PATHAK AND SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, JJ.)

The Supreme Courf issued notice of the Reference to the Members of the Commission including the accused and the Chairperson. All of them as well as some others claiming to have knowledge of the incident or of its alleged background filed affidavits. On behalf of the accused it was inter alia contended that he had been falsely involved in the incident since the Chief Minister was not happy with his appointment as a Member of the Commission.

The Order of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, C.J .-This is the first Reference of its kind made by the President of India to this Court under Article 317 ( 1 ) of the Constitution. That Article reads thus : 317. Removal and suspension of a Member of a Public Service Commission.-(!) Subject to the provisions of clause (3) the Chairman or any other person of a Public Service Commission shall only be removed from his office by order of the President on the ground of misbehaviour after the Supreme Court, on reference being made to it by the President, has, on inquiry held in accordance with the procedure prescribed in that behalf under Article 145, reported that the Chairman or such other member, as the case may be, ought on a11y such ground to be removed. Clause ( 3) of Article 3 I 7, which confers power on the President to remove the Chairman or any other member of a Public Service Commbsion for reasons mentioned in sub-clauses- (a), (b) and (c), is not relevant for our purpose. 2. Not only is this Reference the first of its kind but the facts which have been referred to us for our consideration and report are, f,hockingly, the first of their kind. We hope they will be the last of their kind. The order of Reference recites those facts as follows : On November 24, 1982 at about 13 .00 hours Shri Gopal Krishan Saini, Member, Punjab Public Service Commission, physically assaulted Smt. Santosh Chowdhary, Chairman, Punjab Public Service Commission inasmuch as he slapped her on the face in the presence of three other Members of the Punjab Public Service Commission, namely, S/Shri H.S. Deol, M.S. Brar and W.G.

Amongst them are; Dr. Vinod Gupta, Ujagar Singh, Avtar Singh, Hakam Singh and Dr. Rasewat. An affidavit has also been filed by Shri Saini's wife, the purport of which is that Shri Saini has been involved in this false incident since the Chief Minister of Punjab, Shri Darbara Singh, was not happy with his appointment as a Member of the Punjab Public Service Commission. It is also alleged that the Chair- person's husband was running classes for training students for the Public Service Commission Examinations, that he wanted certain students of his to be favoured in those examinations and that on the failure of Shri Saini to oblige him, his wife, the Chairperson, has involved Shri Saini into a false charge. The Chief Minister of Punjab has filed an affidavit denying the allegations made against him. 4. In pursuance of the notices issued by this Court, the Attorney- General of India and the Advocate-General of Punjab appeared in these proceedings. S. Shri Nariman, who appears on behalf of Shri Saini whose conduct we are called upon to inquire into, contended that before making this Reference, the President should have obtained the opinion of a fact-finding body for his prima facie satisfaction that a case was made out for obtaining a report from this Court on the question of the alleged misbehaviour of Shri Saini. According to counsel, this Court cannot, through the medium of a Reference, be called upon to discharge functions which ordinarily fall within the jurisdiction of a trial court, civil or criminal. The danger of such a procedure is &aid to be that if we hold that the incident is proved, Shri Saini will automatically be held guilty by a criminal court of the charge of a~sault and he will have to suffer a decree for damages in a civil court. Counsel says that under Article 317 ( 1), the limited function of this Court is or ought to be to determine whether the facts found upon by an independent fact-finding body show that the person concerned is guilty of misconduct and, secondly, whether the· mis- conduct is of such a nature as to require his removal from the office of Member of the Public Service Commission. 6. We are unable to accept these submissions. The power of the President m make a reference to this Court under Article 317 (1) is not subject to the condition precedent that he must first have the facts examined by some other body or authority.

There is no justification for reading into the Article a provision which is plainly not to be found in it, especially a provision in the nature of a condition precedent. Besides, the documents annexed to the Reference and indeed the fact that those documents are so annexed would show that the President was satisfied prima facie that the allegations made against the Member of the Public Service Commission require to be inquired into by us. Annexed to the order of Reference are a reply of Shri Saini to the allegations made against him and the statements of the three members of the Commission, Shri H.S. Deol, Shri M.S. Brar and Shri W.(]-. Lall. These four statements are Annexures II, III, III-A and III-B res- pectively to the Reference. It is on the basis of this material that the President has made the Reference. The material is of a kind and nature enough to justify the President's opinion that a prima facie case exists for an inquiry and report by this Court. In these circum- stances, obtaining a preliminary opinion of yet another body would be needless duplication of work and avoidable waste of public time and money. 7. The argument that in a reference under Article. 31 7 ( 1) this Court ought not to embark upon an examination of facts and that its function is limited to determining whether the person l-Oncerned is guilty of misbehaviour and whether the misbehaviour is. of such a nature as to justify his removal is in direct opposition to the plain words of Article 317 ( l ) . That article provides that, subject to the provisions of clause ( 3), (i) the Chairman or any other Member of a Public Service Commission can be removed from his office only by the order of the President on the ground of misbehaviour and (ii) the order of removal can be passed after the Supreme Court has on inquiry reported to the President that the Chairman or the Member of a Public Service Commission is guilty of misbehaviour and ought to be removed from his office on that ground. The inquiry which this Court is required to hold is not into the limited question whether, on the basis of facts found by the President, the charge of misbehaviour is made out and whether the misbehaviour is of such a nature as to warrant the removal of the person from his office. The inquiry con- templated by the article is into the facts themselves and facts also, ~o as to enable thi., Court to pronounce upon the question whether the allegation-; made against the Chairman or Member are proved at all. The purpose of Article 31 7 ( I ) is to ensure the independence of !Ylember~ ot the Public Service Commissions and to give them pro- tection 1n the matter of their tenure.

Members of Public Service Commissions are, in one sense, given a higher degree of protection by the elimina~ tion, as far as possible, of political pressures in the matter of their removal. Any allegation of misbehaviour made against them has to be examined by the Supreme Court on merits unlike the allegations made against those others whose removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity depends upon the will of the Parliament. It is impossible to accept that the Supreme Court in one case and the Parliament in the case of those others are entrusted by the Constitu- tion with the limited power of determining whether the facts found by some other body establish misbehaviour in one case and misbehaviour or incapacity in those others. Their function is to find upon facts and their duty is to pronounce whether the facts found by them establish the charge of misbehaviour or incapacity, as the case may be. 8. The apprehension expressed by the learned counsel that the tinding recorded by this Court will automatically decide the fate of a prosecution or of a civil suit for damages is real but, that is as it ought to be. No grievance can legitimately be made that an examina- tion and assessment of facts is made by this Court instead of being made by a Magistrate or a Munsif. If a full opportunity is given to the parties to prove and rebut the facts in issue as in a regular trial, it is an idle complaint that the evidence has been examined and found upon by the Supreme Court and not by a court of first instance. If, after giving a full opportunity to both the sides, the Supreme Court cc.1mcs to the conclusion that the facts alleged are established, the conviction or a decree for damages may follow as a matter of course. But then, a contrary finding by this Court will equally seal the fate of tho~e proceedings. There is, therefore, no unfair advantage to either side if the que~tions of fact are decided by this Court straight- away. 1f the essential safeguards of a fair adjudication are observed, no grievance can be made that the facts which establish the charge o( misbehaviour are found by the highest Court of the land and not by the lowest. 9. The question which then arises before us is a~ regards the procedure which this Court should a<lopt in a Reference made by eh~ President under Article 317 ( 1) of the Constitution. That Article provides that an inquiry has to be held by this Court in accordance with the procedure prescribed in that behalf under Article 145.

Order XXXVIII of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966 contains rules regulating references under Article 317 ( 1 ) . Rule I of Order XXXVIII mentions the nersons to whom notice of the reference is required to be given. Rule 2. which is in point, provides that \"the Court may summon such witnesses as it considers necessary\". Thi\" rule shows that while making an inquiry into the matter referred to it by the President, tMs Court is entitled to summon witnesses, which obviously is for the purpose of recording their evidence. In other words, while dealing with a reference under Article 317 ( 1 ), this Court has the power to summon witnesses and record their evidence. 10. A procedural issue which was debated before us is whether we should pronounce our opinion on the allegations made against Shri Saini on the basis of the affidavits only or whether we should permit the parties to cross-examine persons who have filed their affidavits. Considering the nature and gravity of the matter referred to us, we are of the opinion that it will not be conducive to justice to decide the Reference on a consideration of the affidavits only. We do not know at this stage whether the allegation made by Shri Saini that he has been falsely involved into the particular incident by reason of certain other matters and at the instance of certain other persons, i<i true or not. But those allegations cannot be adjudicated upon on a consideration of the affidavits only. The credibility of witne<;<.e<; who depose to facts is a matter which bears directly on the adjudication of those facts. And the best method of testing whether a witness is a person of credit is to subject him (or her) to cross- examination. The credit of a witness can be shaken (and, ironically, sometimes estabJM,ed) by cross-examining him and indeed, Section 146 ( 3) of the Evidence Act specifically pennits the cross-examination of a witness in order \"to shake his credit by injuring his character\". Bearing in mind the impact of our findings on a future trial, civil or criminal, relating to the quci;;tion referred to us. the repercussions of our findings on the parties concerned and the fact that the matter referred to us is one of public importance which transcends the immediate private interests of the parties who have made allegations and cmmter-allegations again<.t one another, we arc of the view that parties whose interest~ arc directly affected by these proceedings, that i~ to say the Chairperson Sml.

It was urged by these learned counsel that we are only concerned to determine whether Shri Saini slapped the Chairperson and not with the events antecedent to the assault or which are said to furnish the motive for the alleged false implication of Shri Saini. On the other hand, it was contended by Shri Nariman that the case of his client is that he has been falsely implicated into the charge of assault because he had incurred the wrath of the Chief Minister of Punjab and the hostility of th~ Chairperson's husband and that, it would be impossible for him to prove his case unless he is allowed to cross-examine witnesses on those aspects of the matter. Counsel contends that if he could satisfy us that there was a conspiracy to involve his client falsely or that there were reasons for so involving him, we will be loathe to hold that the alleged incident is proved. Shri Nariman's submission must be accepted in the circumstances of the case. It will be impos~ibk to consider in isolation the evidence bearing directly on the incident which is alleged to have taken place on November 22, 1982. The entire evidence, admissible and relevant, shall have to be taken into account for the purpose of deciding whether the allegation again<;t Shri Saini can be held to be proved. We are not pronouncing at this stage upon the admissibiJity or relevance of any particular piece of evidence, which 1ihall have to be done after the entire evidence is before us. All that we do now is to say that we cannot prevent Shri Saini, against whom a grave charge has been made. from proving that the charge is false and motivated. One of the questions which is bound to arise in this matter, as it arises in matters of similar nature, is as to why the complainant should make a false allegation that she was slapped, courting trouble and involving her own statrn, and respectability. The answer to that question has to be furnh,ltcd by the person who is caUed upon to meet the allegation that he slapped her Answers on questions of fact cannot be made in court<; of law in a vacuum.

Therefore, it is only fair that an opportunity should be given to Shri Saini to prove hi<; case that the charge against him is fabc. inspired and motivated. We only hope that this opportunity will not be exploited by Shri Saini to fight a political battle against lhL Chief Minister or to engage in a duel with the Chairperson's husband. In the ultimate analysis, after the dust raised by these accusations anu counter-accusations has settled down, the fundamental question which this Court will have to answer i<. : Did Shri Saini slap the Chair- person or not?

Order XL VII, Rule 6 of the same Rules pro, ides that nothing contained in the Rules \"shall be deemed to limit or otherwise a~Iccl the inherent powers of the Court to make such or<lers as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the proce!>s of the Court'·. This provision, like its counter- part in ~tatute!:> like the Code of Civil Procedure (Section 151) or the Code of Criminal Procedure (Section 482), does not create or confer any new power but preserves the power of the Coutt to act ex debito justiciae. Though a provision like Rule 6 of Order XLVll of the Supreme Court Ruic~ is not specifically incorporated in Order XXXVIII of those Rules, it shall have to be read in the latter Order in order to enable this Court to pass proper orders in the interest of ju!:>tice. Con~idering the overwhelming commitments of thi5 Court for the time being ( and in the foreseeable future), it is regretfully inexpedient that the evidence should be recorded by this Court itself. No u~eful purpme will be served by expanding our own time in recor<ling the evidence of various witnesses except for the advantage of seeing and hearing th~ witnesses. The balance of convenience requir~~ that we should forego that advantage and delegate the duty of recording evidence. Accordingly, ~e direct that evidence in this Reference will be recorded by a learned Additional District and Sessions Judge. Delhi, who will be nominated by the learned District and Sessions Judge, Delhi. The nomination may be made before August 22. 1983. 13. w~ ~annot confer ,my power on the learned Judge so nommatcd for recording cvi<lence. to deci<le on the admissibility or rdcvanc-e of any particular piece of cvidcnei:.

(2) The evidence to be recorded by the learned Judge will be limited to the cross-examination of witnesses who have filed affidavits before us. In other words, no person who has not filed an affidavit in this Court will be examined or cross-examined as a witness, except with the leave of this Court. ( 3) Witnesses who have filed affidavits in this Court may be summoned or requested by the learned Judge to attend his Court for the purpose of cross-examination. The proceedings will normally be held in Delhi. Evidence may, however, be recorded at any other place if the learned Judge considers it necessary or convenient. 14. The mere fact that the evidence of any particular witness •~ recorded by the learned Judge will not conclude the issue as regards the admissibility or relevance of that evidence. All questions regard- mg admi~~ibility and i'elevance c,f the evidence so recorded will be, decided by this Court during the hearing of the Reference. 15. We hope that all parties concerned will take care to avoid putting frivolou\" or scandalorn, que~tions to witnesses and will afford the necessary cooperation to the learned Judge for an expeditious termination of the proceedings before him. 16.

We expect that the recording of evidence will be over by September 30, 1983. In case it is not over by that date. the learned Judge may write to the Registrar of the Supreme Court for extension of time.
