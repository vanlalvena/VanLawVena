COURT'S INTERFERENCE WITH CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - Sections 482 and 154 & 157 - Criminal proceeding - Wben can be quashed by High Court in exercise of powers under Section 482 or Article 226 - Circumstances stated by way of illustration - On facts held, High Court not justified in quashing the FIR - Constitution of India, Article 226 Respondent 1 (Shri Bhc1jan Lal) on the one hand and DL (Shri Devi Lal) and respondent 2 on the oth1~r belong to two rival political parties. In the gen- eral election for MLA while DL was elected and became the Chief Minister of the State. respondent 2 lost the election against the wife of respondent 1. At that time respondent 1 was a Minister in the Central Cabinet. On account of political rivalry and institution of a number of criminal cases and counter cases, there was bad blood between respondent 1 and DL. On November 12, 1987, respondent 2 presented a complaint before DL against respondent 1 alleging possession of pecuniary resources or property di~proportionate to his known sources of income. The Officer on Special Duty in the Chief Minister's Secretariat made an endorsement 'Chief Minister has seen. For appropriate action' on the complaint and marked the same to the Director General of Police on the same day. The Director General of Police in turn made an endor- sement on the complaint 'Please look into this; take necessary action and report' and marked it to SP al.so on the same day. The complaint along with the endorsements was then put up before the SP on November 21, 1987 on which date itself the SP made his endorsement reading 'Please register a case and investigate'. The SHO (appelllant 3) registered a case on the basis of the allega- tions in the complaint under Sections 161 and 165 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act on November 21, 1987 itself at 6.15 p.m. The SHO after forwarding a copy of the first information report to the Magistrate and other officers concerned, himself took up the investigation. and proceeded to the spot accompanied by three constables of whom two con- stables were handed over one rifle each and 50 cartridges. Respondent 1 there- upon filed a writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 seeking issuance of a writ of certiorari quashing the first information report and also of a writ of prohibi- tion restraining the authoriti{:s from further proceeding with the investigation. The High Court concluded that the allegations do not constitute a cognisable offence for commencing the lawful investigation and granted the relief as prayed for and mulcted respondent 2 with the costs of the writ petition. In the penultimate paragraph of its judgment, the High Court obseIVed thus:\" ... every t From the Judgment and Ordt~r dated September 8, 1988 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in C.W.P.

Setting aside the judgment of the High Court by which it quashed the FIR but also quashing the commencement as well as the entire investigation, if any, so far done and also setting aside the High Court's order awarding costs and disposing of the appeal the Supreme Court Held: The order of the High Court quashing the first information report, viewed from any angle, cannot be sustained both on the question of law and facts. Con- sequently, that part of the judgment of the High Court quashing the first information report is set aside. (Paras 111 and 140) The following categories of cases can be stated by way of illustration wherein the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC can be exercised by the High Court either to prevent abuse of the process of any c:ourt or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and suffi- ciently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised: (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the com- plaint, even if they are taken ait their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code. (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in :support of the same do not disclose the 'commis- sion of any offence and make out a case against the accused. (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code. (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. a b C d e f g h i ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

(Para 105) Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - Sections 482 and 154 & 157 - High Court's power to quash criminal proceedings - Scope - Should be exercised sparingly in rarest or rare cn1ses - Reliability of allegations made in FIR or complaint not to be examined - Constitution of India, Article 226 Held: The power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspec:tion and that too in the rarest of rare cases. The extraordinary or inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whim or caprice. The. court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 338 SUPREME COURT CASES 1992 Supp (1) sec contained in FIR will not ltiad to any averse inference - Constitution of India, Articles 136 and 226 Held: As the entire matter s1tands only at the stage of the registration of the case and the investigation has not at all proceeded with on account of the order of stay granted by the High Court, it is not necessary for the Court at this stage to embark upon an enquiry whether the allegations in the first information report are reliable or not and thereupon to render a finding whether any of the allega- tions is proved. These are matters which can be examined only by the concerned court after the entire materials are placed before it on a thorough investigation. Court is not called upon to examine the truth or otherwise of each of the instances of the alleged corruption indicted in complaint in snippet form and thereafter string them together and express any opinion either way, since in our view any such opinion may affect the case of either party or cripple the course of investigation. (Paras 71 and 68) The non-filing of a written statement by a competent authority of the State Government by way of reply to the averments made in the writ petition cannot also be said to be such a serious flaw at this stage on the part of the appellants that the averments of the respondents can be held as having disproved the entire crimination alleged in the FIR. No adverse inference could be drawn on the mere non-filing of a written statement by the State Govt. in cases of this nature especially when the matter relates to serious disputed facts, yet to be investigated. The stage is premature and as such the government could not be expected to have in its possession all the details in support of the allegations made in the complaint before any enquiry or investigation is launched and com- pleted. The police officials also cannot be expected to give a detailed reply to the averments made in the writ petition when the investigation has not at all been proceeded with. (Para 69) State of Bihar v.

A noticeable feature of the scheme under Chapter XIV of the Code is that a Magistrate is kept in the picture at all stages of the police investigation but he is not authorised to inter- fere with the actual investigation or to direct the police how that investigation is to be conducted.

The core of Sections 156, 157 and 159 of the Code is that if a police officer has reason to suspect the commission of a cog- nizable offence, he must either proceed with the investigation or cause an investigation to be proceeded with by his subordinate; that in a case where the police officer sees no sufficient ground for investigation, he can dispense with the investigation altogether; that the field of investigation of any cognizable offence is exclusively within the domain of the investigating agencies over which the courts cannot have control and have no power to stifle or impinge upon the proceedings in the investigation so long as the investigation proceeds in com- pliance with the provisions relating to investigation and that it is only in a case wherein a police officer decides not to investigate an offence, the concerned Magistrate can intervene and either direct an investigation or in the alternative, if he thinks fit, he himself can, at once proceed or depute any Magistrate sub- ordinate to him to proceed to hold a preliminary inquiry into or otherwise to dispose of the case in the manner provided in the Code.

'Reasonableness' or 'credibility' of the said information is not a condition precedent for registration of a case. The police officer should not refuse to record an information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence and to register a case thereon on the ground that he is not satisfied with the reasonableness or credibility of the information. In Section 154(1) the legis- lature in its coJJective wisdom has carefuJJy and cautiously used the expression \"information\" without qualifying the same as in Section 41(l)(a) or (g) of the Code wherein the expressions, \"reasonable complaint\" and \"credible informa- tion\" are used. (Paras 33 and 32) Criminal Ptocedure Code, 1973 - Section 157(1) and proviso (b) - Con- ditions precedent to commencement or investigation by police - Reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence and sufficiency of ground ror entering on an investigation - Both reason to suspect and sufficiency of ground must be based only on allegations made in FIR - 'Reason to suspect' - Meaning of - Words and Phrases - Interpretation of Statutes .....: Plain meaning Held: The commencement of investigation by a police officer is subject to two conditions, firstly, the police officer should have reason to suspect the commis- sion of a cognizable offence as required by Section 157(1) and secondly, the police officer should subjectively satisfy himself as to whether there is sufficient ground for entering on a111 investigation even before he starts an investigation into the facts and circumstances of the case as contemplated under clause (b) of the proviso to Section 157(1) of the Code. (Para 52) The expression \"reason to suspect\" as occurring in Section 157(1) is not qualified as in Section 41(a) and (g) of the Code, wherein the expression, \"reasonable suspicion\" is lllSed. As the words 'reason to suspect' are apparently clear, plain and unambiguous, considering the context and the object of the procedural provision in question, only the plain meaning rule is to be adopted so as to avoid any hardship or absurdity resulting ,therefrom and the words are used and also to be understood only in common parlance. (Para 42) Pakala Narayana Swami v. Emperor, AIR 1939 PC 47: 66 IA 66: 40 Cri U 364, relied on So read the expression \"reason to suspect the commission of an offence\" would mean the sagacity of rationally inferring the commission of a cognizable offence based on the specific articulate facts mentioned in the first information report as well in the annexures, if any, enclosed and any attending circum- stances which may not amount to proof. Therefore, the existence of the reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence has to be, prima facie, dis- closed by the allegations made in the first information laid before the police officer under Section 154(1).

In other words, the police officer has to satisfy himself only on the allegations mentioned in the first information before he enters on an investigation as to whether those allegations do constitute a cognizable offence warranting an investigation. (Para 51) Criminal Procedure Coch!, 1973 - Section 159 - 'On receiving such report' - Means on receiving report contemplated in Section 157 (.2) The expression \"on receiving such a report\" refers to the receipt of a report contemplated in Section 157(2), because the question of directing an investigation by the Magistrate cannot arise in pursuance of the report referred to under sub-section (1) of Section 157 intimating that the police officer has proceeded with the investigation either in person or by deputing any one of his subordinate officers. (Para 37) Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - Sections 154 & 157 - FIR against public servant - Ground for quashing - Preliminary enquiry should be made before registering a case - Undue haste in registering the case by police officer - Held, by itself not sufficient 1o quash the FIR Held: In a perfect system of prevention and detection of crimes, undeniably the paramount duty of a police officer to whom the commission of a cognizable offence is reported, is to register a case without causing any delay and promptly commence the investigation without perverting or subverting the law.

(Para 75) In this case the SP had directed the SHO to register the case and investigate the same even on the very first day of. the receipt of the complaint from the DGP, in whose office the complaint was lying for nearly 9 days. This unprecedented over-enthusiasm shown by the SP, without disclosing the reasons for making an order entrusting the investigation to the SHO who is not a designated officer under Section 5-A(l), shocks one's sense of justice and fair play even though the untested allegations made in the complaint require a thorough investigation. Still, it is an inexplicable riddle as to why the SP had departed from the norm~,! rule and hastily ordered the SHO to investigate the serious allegations, levelled against a former Chief Minister and a Minister in the Cabinet of the Central Government on the date of the registration of the case. However, this conduct of the SP can never serve as a ground for quashing this FIR. (Para 80) III.

The evidence has to be gathered after a thorough investigation and placed before the court on the basis of which alone the court can come to a conclusion one way or the other on the plea of mala fides. If the allegations are bereft of truth and made maliciously, we are sure, the investigation will say so. At this stage, when there are only allegations and recriminations but no evidence, this court cannot anticipate the result of the investigation and render a finding on the question of mala fides on the materials at present available. Therefore, there is no force in the contention that the complaint should be thrown overboard on the mere unsubstantiated plea of mala fides. (Para 108) Sheonandan Paswan v.

The proper test to be applied in such a case is as to what is the dominant purpose for which the power is exercised.

This is clearly spelt out from the expres- sion \"further provided\" occurring in the second proviso. (Paras 118 and 117) A.C. Sharma v.

The Super- intendent of Police or any police officer of above rank while granting permis- sion to a non-designated police officer in exercise of his power under the second proviso to Section 5-A(l ), should satisfy himself that there are good and sufficient reasons to entrust the investigation with such police officer of a lower rank and record his reasons for doing so.

Delhi Administra- tion, (1973) 1 SCC 726: (1973) 3 SCR 477: 1973 SCC (Cri) 608, relied on In the present case the Inspector of Police (appellant 3), though not a designated officer has be(;:n legally authorised by the State Government in exercise of its powers under the first proviso of Section 5-A(l) to investigate the offences enumerated in clauses (a) to (e) of Section 5(1) of the Act. But no reason was given by the SP in directing the SHO to investigate. Resultantly, it must be held that appellant 3, SHO is not clothed with the requisite legal authority within the meaning of the second proviso of Section 5-A(l) of the Act to investigate the offence ultlder clause (e) of Section 5(1) of the Act. (Paras 123 and 129) The case under consideration is not only registered under Section 5(2) but also under Sections 161 and 165 IPC. The government order authorises the Inspector of Police to investigate only the offences falling under Section 5 of the Act. Therefore, the SHO who has taken up the investigation of the offences inclusive of those under Sections 161 and 165 IPC is not at all clothed with any authority to investigate these two offences, registered under the IPC, apart from the offence under Section 5(2) of the Act. As the question relating to the legal authority of the SHO is raised even at this initial stage, it would be proper and also desirable that the investigation, if at all to be proceeded with in the opinion of the State Government, should proceed only on the basis of a valid order in strict compliance with the mandatory provision of Section 5- A(l ). (Para 130) However, Section 5-A of the Act is mandatory and not directory and the investigation conducted in violation thereof bears the stamp of illegality.

There- fore, a police officer with whom an investigation of an offence under Sec- tion 5(l)(e) of the Act is entrusted should not proceed with a preconceived idea of guilt of that person indicted with such offence and subject him to any harass- ment and victimisation, because in case the allegations of illegal a·ccumulation of wealth are found during the course of investigation as baseless, the harm done not only to that pen;.on but also to the office he held will be incalculable and inestimable.

GENERAL- UNWAKRANTED OBSERVATIONS OF HIGH COURT Constitution of India - Article 136 - Observation made by High Court under Article 226 criticising successor government's endeavour to initiate proceedings against misdeeds of the outgoing government disapproved The observations made by the High Court (see para 132) are unwarranted. If such a view is to be judicially accepted and approved, then it will be tantamount to laying down an alarming proposition that an incoming govern- ment under all circumstances, should put its seal of approval to all the commis- sions and omissions of the outgoing government ignoring even glaring lapses and serious misdeeds and the deleterious and destructive consequences that may follow therefrom. The observations cannot therefore, be approved since the text, tenor and tone of th1e observations gives feeling that such misplaced sympathy indicated therein appears to have considerably weighed with the Judges in taking the extreme step in quashing the first information report. In our democratic polity where the 'Rule of Law' reigns no one - however highly placed he may be - can claim immunity, much less absolute immunity from the Law, but he is always under the. law.

Whoever he may be, however high he is, he a is under the law. No matter how powerful he is and how rich he may be. 6. The heated and lengthy argument advanced in general by all the learned counsel on the magnitude and the multi-dimensional causes of corruption and also about the positive and constructive remedial measures and steps tci be taken for its eradication has necessitated us to b give a brief exordium about its perniciousness, though strictly speaking, we would be otherwise constrained not to express any opinion on this. 7. At the outset we may say that we are not inclined to make an exhaustive smvey and analysis about the anatomy, dimensions and causes c of corruption. It cannot be gainsaid that the ubiquity of corruption is always associated with a motivation of private gain at public expense. 8. Though the hiistorical background and targets of corruption are reviewed time after t1ime, the definitional and conceptual problems are explored and the voluminous causes and consequences of corruption are d constantly debated throughout the globe, yet the evils of corruption and their auto-narcotic effect pose a great threat to the welfare of society and continue to grow in menacing proportion. Therefore, the canker of the venality, if not fought against on all fronts and at all levels, checked and eradicated, will destabilize and debilitate the very foundations of demo- e cracy; wear away the rule of law through moral dec~y and make the entire administration iineffective and dysfunctional. 9. Mere rhetorical preaching of apostolic sermons listing out the evils of corruption and raising slogans with catch words. are of no use in the absence of practical and effective steps to eradicate them; because f 'evil tolerated is evil propagated'. 10. At the same time, one should also be alive to cases where false and frivolous accusations of corruption are maliciously made against an adversary exposing h1im to social ridicule and obloquy with an ulterior motive of wreaking ve:ngeance due to past animosity or personal pique or g merely out of spite r1egardless of the fact whether the proceedings will ultimately culminate into conviction or not. 11. We would like to make it clear that the above exordial note is given without casting any aspersion against any of the parties to the h present proceedings or touching the individual merit of the case. 12. The relevant facts giving rise to this appeal, though have been set out in great detail in the impugned judgment of the High Court, have to be recapitulated in order to enable us to give our own reasons for the findings which we will be arriving at on the interpretation of certain ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

This appeal by grant of special leave is directed by the appel- a lants, namely, the State of Haryana and two others assailing the judgment dated September 8, 1988 of a Division Bench of the High Court of Pun- jab and Haryana rendered i1n Writ Petition No. 9172 of 1987 quashing the entire criminal proceed:ings inclusive of the registration of the first information report and dire:Cting respondent 2, Mr Dharam Pal to pay b the costs to respondent 1, Shri Bhajan Lal. 14. Shri Bhajan Lal was a Minister in 1977 when Shri Devi Lal was the Chief Minister of Haryana State and he became the Chief Minister of the State of Haryana in 1982-87. During the initiation of this criminal C proceeding in question, he was the Union Minister for Environment and Forests, Government of India. 15. In the general electi ion to the legislative assembly of the State of Haryana in June 1987, Smt Jasma Devi, the wife of Shri Bhajan Lal con- tested from Adampur const ittuency on being sponsored by the Congress d (I) party as against responde::nt 2, Mr Dharam Pal who was a nominee of the Lok Dal. Smt Jasma Devi was successfully elected. Dharam Pal presented an election petition calling in question the election of Smt Jasma Devi on a variety of grounds. Shri Devi Lal, respondent 3 in this appeal who was respondent 2 in the writ petition also contested on Lok e Dal's ticket and became successful. Thereafter Shri Devi Lal became the Chief Minister of the State of Haryana in 1987. 16. It seems that -after 1 he general election there were a number of criminal proceedings between the parties one of which being a criminal prosecution against Dharam Pal under Section 307 IPC registered in Adampur police station. On account of the political rivalry and the institution of a number of criminal cases and counter cases there was bad blood between Shri Bhajan Lal on the one hand and Shri Devi Lal on the other. 17. While it was so, on November 12, 1987 Dharam Pal presented a complaint before Shri Devi Lal making certain serious allegations against Bhajan Lal, a brief note of which is given below: Before 1985 Shri Bhajan Lal was a man of ordinary means and did not have any definite source : of income, but after he was inducted in the Cabinet as a Minister and particularly after he became the Chief Mini- ster of the State, he accumu llated huge properties worth crores of rupees in the names of his family members, relations and persons close to him by misusing his power and position and also by undervaluing the market price and all those transactions are benami in character.

BHAJAN LAL (Pandian, J.) 349 plaint, Mr Dharam Pal has given the details citing 20 independent allega- tions, alleging that a palatial house is being constructed at Hissar at the a cost of about Rs 50 lakhs and that extensive lands at various places have been purchased either in the name of his wife, Jasma Devi, or in the names of his sons Kuldlip and Chander Mohan or benami in the names of his relations etc. and that two petrol p1,1mps valuing about Rs 5 lakhs have been installed in the name of his wife, and that certain shops have b been constructed etc. Besides these alleg~tions, it is said that Bhajan Lal has acquired several other properties either in his name or in the names of his benamidars such as shares in the cinemas of Sirsa and Adampur, besides owning trucks, cars etc. and is possessing gold, silver and aiamond ornaments valuing about Rs 5 crores. The accumulation of all those c properties in the shape: of buildings, land, shares and ornaments etc. is far beyond his legal means and, therefore, an investigation should be directed and appropriate action be taken against Shri Bhajan Lal. 18. On the complaint presented by Dharam Pal, the Officer on Spe- d cial Duty (OSD) in the Chief Minister's Secretariat made an endorse- ment on November 12, 1987 in Hindi, the translation of which reads \"C.M. has seen. For appropriate action\" and marked the same to the Director General of Police (DGP), who in turn made an endorsement on November 12, 1987 itself reading \"Please look into this; take necessary action and report\" and marked it to the Superintendent of Police (SP) e Hissar. The said complaint along with the above endorsements of OSD and DGP was put up hefore the SP, appellant 2 on November 21, 1987, on which date itself the SP made his endorsement reading \"Please register a case and investigate\". t 19.

Appellant 3 (SHO) after forwarding a copy of the first informa- tion report to the Magistrate and other officers concerned, himself took up the investigation, and proceeded to the spot accompanied by three a constables of whom two constables were handed over one rifle each and 50 cartridges. 21. While the matter stood thus, respondent 1 filed the Writ Petition No. 9172 of 1987 under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India seeking issuance of a writ of certiorari quashing the first information b report and also of a writ of prohibition restraining the petitioners herein from further proceeding with the investigation. It is stated that the High Court granted an ex parte stay which was thereafter made absolute. 22. Initially three separate written statements were filed before the C High Court, one by Inspector Kartar Singh ( on behalf of the State of Haryana, the SP and SHO who were respondents 1, 3 and 4 in the writ petition and who are the appellants herein); another by respondent 2 Shri Devi Lal (who is the third pro forma respondent in this appeal) and the third one by respondent 5 in the writ petition (who is the corn- d plainant and respondent 2 in this appeal). Subsequently realising that Kartar Singh was not competent to file the written statement on behalf of the State, SP and SHO in terms of the Rules of Business, separate written statements one by the then SP Lekhi Ram and another by Inspector Tara Chand (who registered the case) were filed on July 14, e 1988.

With regard to the contention of non-application of mind on the part of the police officials, the High Court held thus: \"It thus appears that the allegation regarding application of mind by the SHO Inspector Tara Chand of Police Station, Sadar, Hissar has been made only because the SP was feeling shallow under his feet ... that all was not well with them and both of them were feeling cold under thdr feet as to who amongst them would take the odium upon himself for having done something which was in fact not done by either of them. Faced against the wall, they felt com- pelled on July 14, 1988 to put in botch potch affidavits aforesaid which do not indicate: any application of mind by either one of them, much less the Superintendent of Police, Hissar, who was obliged in law to do so.\" 24.

As the applicant Chhabil Dass was not a party to the proceedings before the High Court, his application is rejected. 25. Mr Rajinder Sachar, the learned senior counsel along with the learned Advocate General of Haryana State assisted by Mr Mahabir Singh appeared for the appellants whilst Mr R.K. Garg, the learned senior counsel appeared for respondent 2, Dharam Pal on whose com- plaint the impugned first information report had been registered and the investigation was commenced. Mr K. Parasaran, the learned senior counsel along with Mr P .. Chidambaram, the learned senior counsel assisted by Mr Gopal Subramaniam appeared on behalf of respondent 1. Mr Rajinder Sachar and Mr R.K. Garg made a cascade of vitriolic com- ments on the reasons assigned and the conclusions drawn therefrom by the High Court and assailed the impugned judgment by making a frontal brunt asseverating that the instances of corruption cited in the complaint by Dharam Pal which are in the increase both in volume and virulence, though so far hidden from the public view, and those allegations taken either individually or collectively, unerringly and irrefragably constitute a cognizable offence warranting firstly the registration of a case as con- templated under Section 154(1) of the C'...ode and secondly imperatively demanding a thorough investigation in compliance with the various statutory provisions particularly Sections 156, 157, 159 etc. falling under Chapter XII of the Code. According to them, the High Court has no justification in riding its chariot over the track of investigation and there- by obliterating the same and the High Court in doing so has committed a grave and substantial illegality by quashing the first information report and the further proceedings of the investigation. 26. Mr Parasaran vehemently urged that the impugned judgment is a well considered and well reasoned one and hence there can be no justification for this Court in dislodging the unassailable conclusion.

All the learned counsel appearing for all the parties took much b pain and advanced their eloquent arguments with the aid of a sem of decisions of~ Court, but occasionally punctured with inflamed rhetoric and surcharged with emotions. In addition to their oral arguments they also filed written submissions.

Before discussing which of the submissions ought to prevail, we d shall in the foremost deal with the legal principles governing the registra- tion of a cognizable offence and the in~estigation arising thereon. Sec- tion 154(1) is the relevant provision regarding the registration of a cog- nizable offence and that provision reads as follows: e f \"154. Jnfonnation in cognizable cases.- (1) Every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing by him or under his direction, and be read over to the informant; and every such information, whether given in writing or reduced to writ- ing as aforesaid, shall be signed by the person giving it, and the sub- stance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf!' 29. The above. sub-section corresponds to Section 154 of the old Code (Act of 1898 to which various amendments were made by Act 26 of 1955) and also to Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1882 g (Act 10 of 1882) except for the slight variation in that expr~ion 'local government' had been used in 1882 in the place of 'State Government'. Presently, on the recommendations of the Forty-first Report of the Law Commission, the sub-sections (2) and (3) have been newly added but we are no~ concerned with th~ provisions as they are not relevant for the h purpose of the (jisposal of this case except for making some reference at the appropriate places, if necessitated.

At the stage of registration of a crime or a case on the basis of the information disclosing a cognizable offence in compliance with the mandate of Section 154(1) of the Code, the concerned police officer can- not embark upon an enquiry as to whether the information, laid by the informant is reliable and genuine or otherwise and refuse to register a c case on the ground that the information is not reliable or credible. On the other hand, the officer in charge of a police - station is statutorily obliged to register a case and then to proceed with the investigation if he has reason to suspect the commission of an offence which he is empowered under Section 156 of the Code to investigate, subject to the d proviso to Section 157. (As we have proposed to make a detailed discus- sion about the power of a police officer in the field of investigation of a cognizable offence within the ambit of Sections 156 and 157 of the Code in the ensuing part of this judgment, we do not propose to deal with e those sections in extenso in the present context.) In case, an officer in charge of a police station refuses to exercise the jurisdiction vested in him and to register a case on the information of a cognizable offence reported and thereby violates the statutory duty cast upon him, the per- son aggrieved by such refusal can send the substance of the information 1 in writing and by post to the Superintendent of Police concerned who if satisfied that the information forwarded to him discloses a cognizable offence, should either investigate the case himself or direct an investiga- tion to be made by any police officer subordinate to him in the manner provided by sub-section (3) of Section 154 of the Code. g 32. Be it noted that in Section 154(1) of the Code, the legislature in its collective wisdom has carefully and cautiously used the expression \"information\" without qualifying the same as in Section 41(1)(a) or (g) of the Code wherein the expressions, \"reasonable complaint', and \"credible information\" are used. Evidently, the non-qualification of the word h \"information\" in Section 154(1) unlike in Section 41(1)(a) and (g) of the Code may be for the reason that the police officer should not refuse to record an information relating to the commission of'. a cognizable offence and to register a case thereon on the ground that he is not satisfied with the reasonableness or credibility of the information.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf STATE OF HARY ANA v. BHAJAN LAL (Pandian, l.) 355 'reasonableness' or 'credibility' of the said information is not a condition precedent for registration of a case. A comparison of the present Sec- a tion 154 with those of the earlier Codes will indicate that the legislature had purposely thought it fit to employ only the word \"information\" without qualifying the said word. Section 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1861 (Act 25 of 1861) passed by the Legislative Council of India read that 'every complaint or information' preferred to an officer in b charge of a police station should be reduced into writing which provision was subsequently modified by Section 112 of the Code of 1872 (Act 10 of 1872) which thereafter read that 'every complaint' preferred to an officer in charge of a police station shall be reduced in writing. The word 'complaint' which occurred in previous two Codes of 1861 and 1872 was c deleted and in that place the word 'information' was used in the Codes of 1882 and 1898 which word is now used in Sections 154, 155, 157 and 190(c) of the present Code of 1973 (Act 2 of 1974). An overall reading of all the Codes makes it clear that the condition which is sine qua non for recording a first information report is that there must be an information d and that information must disclose a cognizable offence. e 33. It is, therefore, manifestly clear that if any information disclosing a cognizable offence is laid before an officer in charge of a police station satisfying the requirements of Section 154(1) of the Code, the said police officer has no other option except to enter the substance thereof in the prescribed form, that is to say, to register a case on the basis of such information. 34. In this connection, it may be noted that though a police officer cannot investigate a non-cognizable offence on his own as in the case of f cognizable offence, he can investigate a non-cognizable offence under the order of a Magistrate having power to try such non-cognizable case or commit the same for trial within the terms under Section 155(2) of the Code but subject to Section 155(3) of the Code. Further, under the new- ly introduced sub-section (4) to Section 155, where a case relates to two g offences of which at least one is cognizable, the case shall be deemed to be a cognizable case notwithstanding that the other offences are non- cognizable and, therefore, under such circumstances the police officer can investigate such offences with the same powers as he has while investigating a cognizable offence. h 35. The next key question that arises for consideration is whether the registration of a criminal case under Section 154(1) of the Code ipso facto warrants the setting in motion of an investigation under Chapter XII of the Code. 36.

This provision is qualified by a proviso which is in two parts (a) and (b). As per clause (a) the officer in charge of a police station need not proceed in person or depute a subordinate officer to make an investiga- tion on the spot if the information as to the commission of any such offence is given against any person by name and the case is not of a serious nature. According to clause (b), if it appears to the officer in charge of a police station that there is no sufficient ground for entering on an investigation, he shall not investigate the case. Sub-section (2) of Section 157 demands that in each of the cases mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 157, the officer in charge of the police station must state in his report, required to be for- warded to the Magistrate his reasons for not fully complying with the requirements of sub-section (1) and when the police officer decides not to investigate the case for the reasons mentioned in clause (b) of the proviso, he in addition to his report to the Magistrate, must forthwith notify to the informant, if any, in such manner as may be prescribed by the State Government, the fact that he will not investigate the case or cause the case to be investigated. Section 156(1) which is to be read in conjunction with Section 157(1) states that any officer in charge of a police station may without an order of a Magistrate, investigate any cog- nizable case which a court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of the concerned police station would have power to enquire into or try under provisions of Chapter XIII. Section 156(3) vests a dis- cretionary power in a Magistrate empowered under Section 190 to order an investigation by a police officer as contemplated in Section 156(1 ). It is pertinent to note that this provision does not empower a Magistrate to stop an investigation undertaken by the police. In this context, we may refer to an observation of this Court in State of Bihar v. JA.C. Saldanha 2 at page 568 extending the power of the Magistrate under Section 156(3) to direct further investigation after submission of a report by the investigating officer under Section 173(2) of the Code.

The power conferred upon the Magistrate under Section 156(3) can be exercised by the Magistrate even after submis- sion of a report by the Investigating Officer which would mean that it would be open to the Magistrate not to accept the conclusion of the investigating officer and direct further investigation. This provi- sion does not in any way affect the power of the investigating officer to further investigate the case even after submission of the report as provided in Section 173(8).\" 37. The above two provisions - that is Sections 156 and 157 of the Code are followed by Section 159 which empowers a Magistrate, on receipt of a report forwarded by the police under Section 157 to direct an c investigation or if he thinks fit, at once to proceed or depute any Magistrate subordinate to him to proceed, to hold a preliminary enquiry into, or otherwise to dispose of, the case in the manner provided in the Code. The expression \"on receiving such a report\" evidently refers to the receipt of a report contemplated in Section 157(2), because the question d of directing an investigation by the Magistrate cannot arise in pursuance of the report referred to under sub-section (1) of Section 157 intimating that the police officer has proceeded with the investigation either in per- son or by deputing any one of his subordinate officers. This Court in S.N. Shanna v. Bipen Kumar Tiwari 3 while interpreting the scope of Sec- e tion 159 of the Code has stated thus: (SCC p. 656, paras 4 & 5) f g h i \"This section first mentions the power of the Magistrate to direct an investigation on receiving the report under Section 157, and then states the alternative that, if he thinks fit, he may at once proceed, or depute any Magistrate subordinate to him to proceed, to bold a preliminary enquiry into, or otherwise to dispose of, the case. On the face of it, the first alternative of directing an investiga- tion cannot arise in a case where the report itself shows that investigation by the police is going on in accordance with Sec- tion 156. It is to be noticed that the second alternative does not give the Magistrate an unqualified power to proceed himself or depute any Magistrate to hold the preliminary enquiry. That power is preceded by the condition that he may do so, 'if he thinks fit'. The use of this exprCMion makes it clear that Section 159 is primarily meant to give to the Magistrate the power of directing an investiga- tion in cases where the police decide not be investigate the case under the proviso to Section 157(1), and it is in those cases that, if be thinks fit, he can choose the second alternative.\" 3 (1970) 1 sec 653: (1970) 3 SCR 946 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

In India as has been shown there is a statutory right on the b part of the police to investigate the circumstances of an alleged cog- nizable crime without requiring any authority from the judicial authorities, and it would, as their Lordships think, be an unfortunate result if it should be held possible to interfere with those statutory rights by an exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The c functions of the judiciary and the police are complementary not overlapping and the combination of individual liberty with a due observance of law and order is only to be obtained by leaving each to exercise its own function, always, of course, subject to the right of the court to intervene in an appropriate case when moved under Section 491, Cr PC to give directions in the nature of habeas corpus. d In such a case as the present, however, the court's functions begin when a charge is preferred before it and not until then.\" 39.

We shall now examine as to what are the requirements to be d satisfied by an officer in charge of a police station before be enters into the realm of investigation of a cognizable offence after the stage of registration of the offence under Section 154(1). We have already found that the police have under Section 154(1) of the Code a statutory duty to register a cognizable offence and thereafter under Section 156(1) a e f g h I statutory right to investigate any cognizable case without requiring sanc- tion of a Magistrate. However, the said statutory right to investigate a cognizable offence is subject to the fulfilment of a pre-requisite condi- tion, contemplated in Section 157(1). The condition is that the officer in charge of a police station before proceeding to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case should have \"reason to s~pect\" the commis- sion of an offence which he is empowered under Section 156 to investigate. Section 135 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1861 (Act 25 of 1861) required the police officer on receipt of a complaint or information constituting any of the offences specified in column 3 of the schedule annexed to that Act should proceed with the investigation, but this Code did not require the condition of entertaining the reason to suspect the commission of an offence before commencing the investiga- tion. Subsequently, in the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1872 a provi- sion, namely, Section 114 which was more or less similar to the present Section 157(1) was introduced which provision required the police officer to have \"reason to suspect\" the commission of a cognizable offence before he proceeded to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case.

May it be noted that the Law Commission of India in its Forty-first report a expressed its opinion that Section 157 did not call for any amendment. 42. The expression \"reason to suspect\" as occurring in Sec- tion 157(1) is not qualified as in Section 41(a) and (g) of the Code, wherein the exprasion, \"reasonable suspicion\" is used. Therefore, it bas become imperative to find out the meaning of the words \"reason to b suspect\" which words arc apparenti, clear, plain and unambiguous. Con- sidering the context and the object of the procedural provision in ques- tion, we are of the view that only the plain meaning rule is to be adopted so as to avoid any hardship or absurdity resulting therefrom and the words arc used and also to be understood only in common parlance. We c may, in this behalf: refer to a decision of the Privy Council in Pakala Narayana Swami v. Emperor\" wherein Lord Atkin said as follows: \"[W]hen the meaning of words is plain it is not the duty of the courts to busy themselves with supposed intentions .... It therefore appears inadllllMible to consider the advantages or disadvantages of d applying the plain meaning whether in the interests of the prosecu- tion or the accused.\" 43. The word 'suspect' is lexically defined in Webster's Third Intema- twnal Dictionary as follows: Suspect - to look up at, suspect, the act of suspecting or the condition of being suspected ... to have doubts of; be dubious or suspicious about; (2) to imagine (one) to be guilty or culpable on slight evidence or without proof ... (3) to imagine to be or be true, likely or probable; have a suspicion, intimation or inkling of. 44. In Corpus Juris Secundum (Vol. 83) at page 923 the meaning of the word 'suspect' is given thus: \"The term 'suspect', which is not technical, is defined as mean- e f ing to imagine to exist, have some, although insufficient, grounds for inferring; also to have a vague notion of the existence of, without g adequate proof; mistrust, surmise. It has been distinguished from 'believe'. 4S. In the same volume, the expression \"suspicion\" is defined at page '.¥27 as follows: \"The act of suspecting or the state of being suspected, the h imagination, generally of something ill; the imagination of the exis- tence of something without proof, or upon very slight evidence, or upon no evidence at ill .... \" 6 AIR 1939PC47, 51-52: 66 IA66: 40 Cri U 364 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

In WDIW' and Phrases (Permanent Edition 40-A) at page 590, the word 'suspicion' is defined thus: 'Suspicion' implies a belief or opinion as to guilt, based on facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof. Scaffido v. State 1• The state of mind which in a reasonable man would lead to inquiry is called mere 'suspicion'. Stuart v. Fanners' Bank of Cuba City'. 41. Again at page 591 the said word is expounded as follows: .. The word 'suspicion' is defined as being the imagination of the existence of something without proof, or upon very slight evidence, or upon no evidence at all. Cook v. Singer Sewing Machine Co.' See also (1) Emperor v. Vunlabai Deshpande 10; (2) United States v. c Cortes11 and (3) Dallison v. Caffery12• 48. One should not lose sight of the fact that Section 157(1) requires the police officer to have ~ason to suspect only with regard to the com- mission of an offence which he is empowered under Section 156 to investigate, but not with regard to the involvement of an accused in the d crime. Therefore, the expression \"reason to suspect the commission of an offence\" would mean the sagacity of rationally inferring the commis- sion of a cognizable offence based on the specific articulate facts men- tioned in the first information report as ·well in the annexures, if any, enclosed and any attending circumstances which may not amount to e proof. In other words, the meaning of the expression \"reason to suspect\" has to be gov~med and dictated by the facts and circumstances of each case and at that stage the question of adequate proof of facts alleged in the first information report does not arise. In this connection, we would like to recall an obsetvation of this Court made in State of Gujarat v. f Mohanlal J. Porwal 13 while interpreting the expression 'reasonable belief. It runs thus: (SCC p. 369, para 4) g h i \"Whether or not the officer concerned had entertained reasonable belief under the circumstances is not a matter which can be placed under legal microscope, with an over-indulgent eye which sees no evil anywhere within the range of its eyesight.

Their right of enquiry d is conditioned by the existence of reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence and they cannot, reasonably, have reason so to suspect unless the FIR, prima facie, discloses the commission of such offence.\" 51. As pointed out in the earlier part of this judgment, Sec- 8 tion 157(1) is qualified by a proviso which is in two parts (a) and (b). Clause (a) of the proviso is only an enabling provision with which we are not very much concerned. However, clause (b) of the said proviso imposes a fetter on a police officer directing him not to investigate a case where it appears to him that there is no sufficient ground in entering on f an investigation. As clause (b) of the proviso permits the police officer to satisfy himself about the sufficiency of the ground even before entering on an investigation, it postulates that the police officer has to draw his satisfaction only on the materials which were placed before him at that stage, namely, the first information together with the documents, if any, g enclosed. In other words, the police officer has to satisfy himself only on the allegations mentioned in the first information before he enters on an investigation as to whether those allegations do constitute a cognizable offence warranting an investigation. 52. From the above discussion, it is pellucid that the commencement of investigation by a police officer is subject to two conditions, firstly, the police officer should have reason to suspect the commission of a cog- nizable offence as required by Section 157(1) and secondly, the police 14 1962 Supp 3 SCR 866: AIR 1962 SC 1559 h i ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

The next point for consideration is whether Section 157 of the Code gives the police officers carte blanche drawing no legal bounds in the province of investigation and whether the powers of the police officers in the field of investigation are wholly immune from judicial reviewability. 54. The above questions have been examined by the courts on several occasions and they have by judicial pronouncements caived out an area, limited though it be, within which the legality of the exercise of powers by police officers in the realm of investigation can yet be sub- jected to judicial reviewability and scrutiny and the immunity enjoyed by the police officers is only a conditional immunity. Toe Privy Council in Nazir Ahmed case4 though has ruled that it is of the utmost importance that the judiciary should not interfere with the police in matters which are within their province has provided an exception to that above obser- vation to the effect that if no cognizable offence or no case of any kind is disclosed, the police would have no authority to undertake the investiga- tion. SS. This Court on several occasions has expressed its concern for personal liberty of a citizen and also has given warning about the serious consequences that would flow when there is non-observance of procedure by the police while exercising their unfettered authority. Gajendragadkar, J. speaking for the bench in R..P. Ka.pur v. State of Pun- jabu states as follows: (SCR p. 396) \"It is of utmost importance that investigation into criminal offences must always be free from any objectionable features or infirmities which may legitimately lead to the grievance of the accused that the work of investigation is carried on unfairly or with any ulterior motive.\" 56. Krishna Iyer, J. in Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani 1' has expressed his view thus: (SCC p. 430, para 6) \" ... a police officer who is not too precise, too sensitive and too constitutionally conscientious is apt to trample under foot the guaranteed rjght of testimonial tacitness.,, 57.

The fact that the Code does not contain any other provision giving power to a Magistrate to stop investigation by the police cannot be a ground for holding that such a power must be read in Section 156 of the Code.\" S8. Mathew, J. in his majority judgment in Prabhu Dayal Deorah v. District Magistrote, Kamrup 11 while emphasising the preservation of per- c sonal liberty has expressed his view thus: (SCC p. 114, para 21) \"We say, and we think it is necessary to repeat, that the gravity of the evil to the community resulting from anti-social activities can never furnish an adequate reason for invading the personal liberty d of a citizen, except in accordance with the procedure established by the Constitution and the laws. The history of personal liberty is largely the history of insistence on observance of procedure. And observance of procedure has been the bastion against wanton assaults on personal liberty over the years. Under our Constitution, the only guarantee of personal liberty for a person is that he shall e not be deprived of it except in accordance with the procedure estab- lished by law.\" 59. Chandrachud, C.J. in Swapan Kumar Guha case 1 while examini- ng the power of a police officer in the field of investigation of a cog- nizable offence has affirmed the view expressed by Mathew, J. and f obsetved as follows: (SCC p. 577, para 22) \"There is no such thing like unfettered discretion in the realm of powers defined by statutes and indeed, unlimited discretion in that sphere can become a ruthless destroyer of personal freedom. The power to investigate into cognizable offences must, therefore, g be exercised strictly on the condition on which it is granted by the Code.\" 60. The sum and substance of the above deliberation results in a conclusion that the investigation of an offence is the field exclusively reserved for the police officers whose powers in that field are unfettered so long as the power to investigate into the cognizable offences is legitimately exercised in strict compliance with the provisions falling under Chapter XII of the Code and the courts are not justified in 11 (1974) 1 sec 103, 114: 1974 sec (Cri) 1s: (1974) 2 SCR 12, 22 h i ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

BHAJAN LAL (Pandian, J.) 365 obliterating the track of investigation when the investigating agencies are well within their legal bounds as aforementioned. Indeed, a noticeable feature of the scheme under Chapter XIV of the Code is that a Magistrate is kept in the picture at all stages of the police investigation but he is not authorised to interfere with the actual investigation or to direct the police how that investigation is to be conducted. But if a police officer transgresses the circumscribed limits and improperly and illegally exercises his investigatory powers in breach of any statutory provision causing serious prejudice to the personal liberty and also property of a citizen, then the court on being approached by the person aggrieved for the redress of any grievance, has to consider the nature and extent of the breach and pass appropriate orders as may be called for without leaving the citizens to the mercy of police echelons since human dignity is a dear value of our Constitution. It needs no emphasis that no one can demand absolute immunity even if he is wrong and claim unquestionable right and unlimited powers exercisable up to unfathomable cosmos. Any recognition of such power will be tantamount to recognition of 'Divine Power' which no authority on earth can enjoy. 61. Heretofore, we have dealt with the intendment of the various statutory provisions relating to the registration of the first information report, the statutory duty cast on the police officers to investigate the cognizable offence, such authority of the police officers in the field of investigation and the circumscribed limits imposed on such authority in the conduct of investigation. 62. The central issue involved for scrutiny is whether the order of the court in quashing the first information report and the proceeding of the investigation is legally sustainable and if not, to what extent the said order suffers from legal infirmity. 63. Mr K. Parasaran forcefully contended that the allegations averred in the complaint even if taken at their face value and accepted in its entirety do not constitute an offence demanding either the registra- tion of a case or commencement of an investigation; that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the procedure of criminal law to be proceeded with against Shri Bhajan Lal and that the High Court on a proper appreciation of the material placed before it has come to a correct and indisputable conclusion based on the logical reasonings that no offence is disclosed and no case is made out. According to him the allegations of corruption wrapped in a cocoon of ambiguity, falsity and vagueness demonstrate only the personal and old political rivalry that existed over a period between Shri Devi Lal and Shri Bhajan Lal rather than constitut- ing a criminal offence. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

Reverting to the severe critical charges levelled against the validity of the impugned judgment and the recrimination made on behalf of Shri Bhajan Lal, we shall at the threshold anatomize the reasons a imputed by the High Court for quashing the first information report in the backdrop of the legal principles enunciated in the preceding part of this judgment. 65. The complainant Dharam Pal has cited as many as 20 instances in his complaint with an exordial note that Shri Bhajan Lal before 1969 b was only a man of ordinary means without having any definite source of income and that he after becoming a Minister and then as Chief Mini- ster, accumulated enormous property worth crores of rupees under shady transactions inclusive of benami transactions in the names of his family members, relatives and persons close to him by misusing his power and c position. Added to that in the final part of the complaint he has alleged: \"Besides this, Bhajan Lal has other properties in his name or benami like shares in cinemas of Sirsa and Adampur, trucks and cars at Adampur and Hissar and Fatehbad, petrol pump at Agroha Mor and is possessing gold, silver and diamond ornaments valued about Rs 5 crores which are far d beyond the legal means of Shri Bhajan Lal.\" 66. Both in the writ petition (Writ Petition No. 9172 of 1987) filed before the High Court as well in the counter-affidavit filed before this Court Shri Bhajan Lal (respondent 1 herein) has attempted to answer e those allegations levelled against him by (1) giving a detailed account revealing a chronicle of the old political rivalry that existed between him on the one hand and Shri Devi Lal and Dharam Pal on the other and a brief summary of a spate of criminal cases in which the parties to this proceeding and their men were embroiled and (2) offering an explana- f tion to some of the allegations and emphatically abjuring the rest. In sup- port of his assertions made on oath in the counter-affidavit, he has enclosed 11 annexures. An additional affidavit has been filed by Dharam Pa] by way of amplification alleging that Bhajan Lal is constructing a palatial house worth about Rs 50 lakhs, the built-in area of which is not g less than 21,100 sq. ft. 67. During the course of the hearing of the case, an unnumbered interlocutory application in the special leave petition enclosed with a copy of an unnumbered Writ Petition (Civil) of 1988 preferred before the High Court of Delhi by M/s Bhanu Steels Pvt.

Ltd. had entered into an agreement of sale dated September 22, 1988 with Mrs Roshni Bishnoi (who is respondent 7 in the said writ petition and who is none other than the daughter of Shri Bhajan Lal) in respect of the above property namely D-1028, New Friends Colony, New Delhi for a consider- ation of Rs 40 lakhs plus unearned increase payable to the DDA which at present effective rates work out to Rs 14,05,515. 68. Mr Chidambaram took a strong objection stating that these untested allegations are introduced only to prejudice the court and, therefore, the court should refrain from considering these allegations. We may straightway say that we do not take note of these new allega- tions as we are not called upon at this stage to embark upon an enquiry whether the allegations in the first information report are reliable or not and thereupon to render a finding whether any of the allegations is proved. These are matters which can be examined only by the concerned court after the entire materials are placed before it on a thorough investigation. 69. As pointed out earlier no counter was filed before the High Court o·n behalf of appellant 1 (the State of Haryana), but only appel- lants 2 and 3 filed separate written statements at a later stage mainly con- tending that it is wholly premature to give any reply with regard to the averments made in the writ petition. The High Court went in detail into the motive alleged by Shri Bhajan Lal and then examined the allegations in the light of the untested explanation and denial made by Bhajan Lal and finally concluded that: \"The charges levelled in the complaint Annexure P-9 by respondent 5 against the petitioner are, therefore, all groundless.\" Since we have already reproduced some of the observations of the High Court in the earlier portion of this judgment, it is unnecessary to reproduce them in this connection. The impugned judg- ment spells out that the learned Judges of the High Court had felt that the non-filing of a written statement by a competent authority of the State Government by way of reply to the averments made in the writ petition is a serious flaw on the part of appellants and as such the aver- ments of Shri Bhajan Lal should be held as having disproved the entire crimination alleged in the FIR. The above view of the High Court in our opinion, is neither conceivable nor comprehensible. Further no adverse inference could be drawn on the mere non-filing of a written statement by the State of Haryana in cases of this nature especially when the matter relates to serious disputed facts, yet to be investigated.

Similarly, the appellants 2 and 3 a who are only police officials also cannot be expected to give a detailed reply to the averments made in the writ petition when the investigation has not at all been proceeded with. It will be appropriate to refer to a decision of this Court in State of Bihar v. J.A.C. Saldanha 2 (at SCC p. 574) wherein this Court has disapproved the exercise of the b extraordinary power of the High Court in issuing a prerogative writ quashing the prosecution solely on the basis of the averments made in the affidavit in the following words: (SCC p. 574, para 28) \"The High Court in exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction committed a grave error by making observations on seriously dis- c puted questions of facts taking its cue from affidavits which in such a situation would hardly provide any reliable material. In our opinion the High Court was clearly in error in giving the direction virtually amounting to a mandamus to close the case before the investigation is complete. We say no more.\" d 70. It is true that some of the allegations do suffer from misty vague- ness and lack of particulars. Further as urged by Mr Parasaran, there are no specific averments that either Shri Bhajan Lal or his relations and friends had no source of income to accumulate the properties now stand- ing in their names and that Shri Bhajan Lal showed any favour to them e by misusing his official power. In our considered view, these are all mat- ters which would be examined only during the course of investigation and thereafter by the court on the materials collected and placed before it by the investigating agencies. The question whether the relations and friends of Shri Bhajan Lal have independently purchased the properties I out of their own funds or not also cannot be decided by the court at this stage on the denial statement of Bhajan Lal alone. 71. While Mr Rajinder Sachar and Mr Garg took much pain to show that the reasons given by the High Court in respect of each of the instances are not legally sustainable, Mr Parasaran submitted a tabular g statement by listing out each of the instances of the alleged corruption indicted in the complaint, the explanation given in the writ petition as well as in the counter-affidavit related thereto and the reply in the rejoinder and urged that the allegations in the FIR are nothing but a h conglomeration of calumny and falsehood .. As the entire matter stands only at the stage of the registration of the case and the investigation has not at all proceeded with on account of the order of stay granted by the High Court, we do not intend or propose to examine the truth or other- wise of each of the instances in snippet form and thereafter string them ; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

BHAJAN l.AL (Pandian, J.) 369 together and express any opinion either way, since in our view any such opinion may affect the case of either party or cripple the course of a investigation. 72. An argument was advanced by Mr Parasaran submitting that the proposition of law laid down by this Court in Swapan Kumar Gu.ha case1 holding that \"the legal position appears to be that if an offence is dis- closed, the court will not normally interfere with an investigation into the b case\" clearly shows that this Court has caived out an area wherein the courts can interfere in criminal proceedings at any stage if circumstances so warrant and quash the same. Based on the above proposition of law, he states that as the allegations in the present case are demonstrably shown to be speculative and false the judgment of the High Court quash- c ing the proceedings has to be sustained. In our considered view, this sub- mission cannot be countenanced for the reasons - firstly we, at this premature stage, are unable to share the view expressed by the High Court that the charges levelled against Shri Bhajan Lal are all groundless d and secondly Swapan Kumar Guha case1 cannot be availed of by respon- dent 1 as the question that came up for determination was entirely dif- ferent. The facts in Swapan Kumar Guha ease1 were as follows: San- chaita Investments, a partnership firm was carrying on business as finan- ciers and investors and in its business the firm accepted loans or deposits e from the general public for different periods repayable with interest, giving option to the depositors for premature withdrawal. The firm was carrying on its business on a very extensive scale. While so, the Parlia- ment passed the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978. On December 13, 1980, the Commercial Tax Officer, Bureau f of Investigation, lodged a complaint of violation of the said Act by the firm with.the police on the groun,d that the amount in excess of 12 per cent interest so paid showed that the Money ·Circulation Scheme was being promoted and conducted for the making of quick and/or easy money. Two of the partners were arrested. Thereafter the firm and its 9 two partners filed the writ petition in the High Court challenging the validity of the first information report and the proceedings arising out of the same. The question for consideration was as to whether the first information report prima facie disclosed the offence under Section 4 read with Section 3 of the Act of 1978 in the light of the requirement of h Section 2(c) of the Act defining the expression \"Money Circulation Scheme\". This Court examined that question with reference to the facts therein and ultimately held that the allegations did not attract the provi- sions of Act of 1978. The question that arises for consideration in the present case is not the one as in Swapan Kumar Gu.ha ease1• i 73.

Except expressing our view that those remarks are not warranted, we refrain from making any mcire comment. 74. Mr Parasaran made a mordacious criticism articulating that the impassioned and impetuous police officers in order to show their loyalty to respondent 3, Shri Devi Lal had overstepped their permissible limits in taking a rash decision in registering the FIR and commencing the investigati~n and that the said first information report bears on its face 'the stamp of hurry and want of care'. He, in this connection, drew our attention to an observation of the High Court which reads thus: \"Overzealous police officers, who tried to be more loyal to the king i.e. respondent 2 than the king himself however fell into the trap laid by respondent 5 and ordered registration of the case and its investigation without any clue .... \" (Respondents 2 and 5 mentioned in the above observation are Shri Devi Lal and Dharam Pal respectively). 75. In a perfect system of prevention and detection of crimes, undeniably the paramount duty of a police officer to whom the commis- sion of a cognizable offence is reported, is to register a case without caus- ing any delay and promptly commence the investigation without pervert- ing or subverting the law. When such is the accepted principle, can it be said that the police officers in the instant case have overzealously taken a hasty decision by misusing their positions in registering the case and com- mencing the investigation? To answer this query. let us recapitulate some salient facts on this aspect. The complainant, Dharam Pal, presented the complaint on November 12, 1987 before Shri Devi Lal whose officer on special duty marked it to the DGP on the same day. The DGP sent it with his endorsement dated November 12, 1987 to the S.P. Hissar, who received it on November 21, 1987. The S.P. on the same day made the endorsement \"Please register a case and investigate\". In the affidavit filed before the High Court, the SP has stated that as there were Jerious allegations of corruption against Shri Bhajan Lal in the complaint constituting a prima fade case under Section 5(2) of the Act, he made his endorsement on the same day and marked it to the SHO under his signature and that he, then, summoned the SHO and handed over the complaint to him and the SHO also went through the contents of the complaint and was of the opinion that a prima facie case under Section 5(2) of the Act and under Sections 161 and 165 IPC has been made out and that the SHO took the complaint and left for his station for further necessary action.

The conduct of the SRO-indicates that he without losing any time registered the case and commenced the investigation by proceeding to the 'spot' accompanied by armed constables. The allega- tions in the complaint cover the period commencing from 1969 and ending with 1986 as noted in the FIR. Be it noted that by June 1987, Shri Devi Lal became the Chief Minister. The complaint was presented by Dharam Pal nearly 5 months after Devi Lal became the Chief Minister. 76. The gravamen of the accusation is that Shri Bhajan Lal has amassed huge assets by misusing his ministerial authority earlier to 1986 which assets are disproportionate to his known and licit sources of income. It has been repeatedly pointed out that mere possession of any pecuniary resources or property is by itself not an offence, but it is the failure to satisfactorily account for such possession of pecuniary resources or property that makes the possession objectionable and con- stitutes the offence within the ambit of Section S(l)(e) of the Act. There- fore, a police officer with whom an investigation of an offence under Section 5( 1 )( e) of the Act is entrusted should not proceed with a precon- ceived !dea of guilt of that person indicted with such offence and subject him to any harassment and victimisation, because in case the allegations of illegal accumulation of wealth are found during the course of investigation as baseless, the harm done not only to that person but also to the office he held will be incalculable and inestimable. 77. In this connection, it will be appropriate to recall the views expressed by Mitter, J. in P. Sirajuddin v. State of Madras 18 in the follow- ing words: (SCC p. 601, para 17) \"Before a public servant, whatever be his status, is publicly charged with acts of dishonesty which amount to serious mis- demeanour or misconduct of the type alleged in this case and a first information is lodged against him, there must be some suitable preliminary enquiry into the allegations by a responsible officer. The lodging of such a report against a person specially one who like the appellant occupied the top position in a department, even if base- less, would do incalculable harm not only to the officer in particular but to the department he belonged to, in general .... The means adopted no less than the end to be achieved must be impeccable.\" 78. Mudholkar, J. m a separate judgment in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Bhagwant Kishore Joshi 19 at p. 86 while agreeing with the conclusion of Subba Rao, J. (as he then was) has expressed his opinion stating: (SCR pp. 86-87) \"In the absence of any prohibition in the Code, express or implied, I am of opinion that it is open to a police officer to make 1s (1970) 1 sec 595: 1970 sec (Cri) 240: (1970) 3 scR 931 19 (1964) 3 SCR 71: AIR 1964 SC 221: (1964) 1 Cri U 140: (1964) 1 LU 60 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

We are in agreement with the views, expressed by Mitter, J. and a Mudholkar, J. in the above two decisions. 80. Now coming to the present case, we regret to note that the SP seems to have exhibited some over-enthusiasm, presumably to please 'someone' and had directed the SHO to register the case and investigate the same even on the very first day of the receipt of the complaint from b the DGP, in whose office the complaint was lying for nearly 9 days. This unprecedented over-enthusiasm shown by the SP, without disclosing the reasons for making an order entrusting the investigation to the SHO who is not a designated officer under Section 5-A(l ), about which we· shall advert to in detail in the ensuing part of the judgment, really shocks one's c sense of justice and fair play even though the untested allegations made in the complaint require a thorough investigation. Still, it is an inexplicable riddle as to why the SP had departed from the normal rule and hastily ordered the SHO to investigate the serious allegations, levelled against a former Chief Minister and a Minister in the Cabinet of d the Central Government on the date of the registration of the case. However, this conduct of the SP can never serve as a ground for quash- ing this FIR. 81. The nagging question that comes up for examination more often 6 than not is under what circumstances and in what categories of cases, a criminal proceeding can be quashed either in exercise of the extraordinary powers of the High Court under Article 226 of the Con- stitution of India or in the exercise of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code. This question has often been hotly f debated before this Court and various High Courts. Though in a series of decisions, this question has been answered on several occasions by this apex Court, yet the same still comes up for consideration and is seriously agitated. 82. Mr Rajinder Sachar and Mr R.K. Garg vehemently attacked the g judgment under appeal contending that the High Court in the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction' under Article 226 should not have inter- fered with the unbridled power of the police officials and quashed the entire proceedings from the stage of the registration of the case especial- ly when the allegations made in the complaint limpidly constitute h offences both under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code and this unjustifiable interference is in clear violation of the principles laid down by this Court in a host of decisions.

Khwaja Nazir Ahmad 4 though strongly observed that the a judiciary should not interfere with the police in matters which are within their province, has qualified the above statement of law by saying: (AIR p. 22) b \"No doubt, if no cognizable offence is disclosed, and still more if ·no offence of any kind is disclosed, the police would have no authority to undertake an investigation .... \" 84. The above observation shows that an investigation can be quashed if no cognizable offence is disclosed by the FIR. 85. Gajendragadkar, J. speaking for the Court while considering the c inherent powers of the High Court in quashing the first information report under Section 561-A of the old Code ( corresponding to Sec- tion 482 of the new Code) in R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab 15 at page 393 made the following observation: d e \"Cases may also arise where ·the allegations in the first informa- tion report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not constitute the offence alleged; in such cases no question of appreciating evidence arises; it is a matter merely of looking at the complaint or the first informa- tion report to decide whether the offence alleged is disclosed or not. In such cases it would be legitimate for the High Court to hold that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the process of the criminal court to be issued against the accused person.\" 86. In the case of State of W.B. v. S.N. Basak'llJ the accused therein contended that the statutory power of investigation given to police under f Chapter XIV of the Code is not available in respect of an offence triable under the West Bengal Criminal Law Amendment (Special Courts) Act, 1949 and that being so, the investigation undertaken by the police was without jurisdiction. The court while negativing that contention and holding that the application filed by the accused under Section 439 and g Section 561-A of the old Code was liable to be dismissed, observed that the statutory powers given to the police under Sections 154 and 156 of the Code to investigate into the circumstances of an alleged cognizable offence without authority from a magistrate cannot be interfered with by the exercise of power under Section 439 or under the inherent power h conferred by Section 561-A of the old Code. But in that case, no ques• tion arose as to whether the allegations in the FIR disclosed any offence it all. i 87. In S.N. Shanna v.

His application under Section 159 of the Code asking that the Judicial Magistrate should himself conduct a preliminary enquiry was dismissed. However, the court has pointed out thus: (SCC pp. 657-58, a para 11) \"It appears to us that, though the Code of Criminal Procedure gives to the police unfettered power to investigate all cases where they suspect that a cognizable offence has been committed, in appropriate cases an aggrieved person can always seek a remedy by b invoking the power of the High Court under Article 226 of the Con- stitution under which, if the High Court could be convinced that the power of investigation has been exercised by a police officer mala fide, the High Court can always issue a writ of mandamus restraining the police officer from misusing his legal powers. The fact that the c Code does not contain any other provision giving power to a Magistrate to stop investigation by the police cannot be a ground for holding that such a power must be read in Section 159 of the Code.\" SS. In Hazari Lal Gupta v. Rameshwar Prasad1-1 this Court has stated thus: (SCC p. 455, para 12) d \"In exercising jurisdiction under Section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure Code, the High Court can quash proceedings if there is no legal evidence or if there is any impediment to the institution or continuance of proceedings but the High Court does not ordinarily inquire as to whether the evidence is 'reliable or not'. Where again, e investigation into the circumstances of an alleged cognizable offence is carried on under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, the High Court does not interfere with such investigation because it would then be the impeding investigation and jurisdiction of statutory authorities to exercise power in accordance with the provi- sions of the Criminal Procedure Code.\" f 89. In Jehan Singh v. Delhi Administration 22 the application filed by the accused under Section 561-A of the old Code for quashing the investigation was dismissed as being premature and incompetent on the finding that prima facie, the allegations in the FIR, if assumed to be cor- g rect, constitute a cognizable offence. 90. This Court in Amar Nath v. State of Haryana 23 bas pointed out that the inherent powers of the court can ordinarily be exercised when there is no express provision on the subject matter and that when there is an express provision, barring a particular remedy the court cannot resort h to the exercise of inherent powers. 21 (1972) 1 sec 452,455: 1972 sec (Cri) 208 22 (1974) 4 sec 522: 1974 sec (Cri) 558: (1974) 3 scR 794 23 (1977) 4 sec 137: 1977 sec (Cri) 585 i ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

In Kurukshetra University v. State of Haryanazs on which Mr Rajinder Sachar has placed strong reliance, Chandrachud, J. as he then was, while disapproving the quashing of a first information report at premature stage has expressed his view as follows: (SCC p. 451, para 2) \"It surprises us in the extreme that the High Court thought that in the exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it could quash a first information report. The police had not even commenced investigation into the complaint filed by the Warden of the University and no proceeding at all was pending in any court in pursuance of the FIR. It ought to be realised that inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim or caprice. That statutory power has to be exercised sparingly, with circumspection and in the rarest of rare cases.\" 93. The Supreme Court in State of Bihar v. JA.C. Saldanha 2 exam- ined the question whether, when the investigation was in progress, the High Court was justified in interfering with the investigation and prohibiting or precluding further investigation in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. On the facts of that case, this Court set aside the order of the High Court quash- ing the order of the Magistrate in postponing the consideration of the report submitted to him till the final report of completion of further investigation, directed by the State Government was submitted to him and held that the High Court in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction committed a grave error in giving the direction virtually amounting to mandamus to close the case before the inv~stigation was complete. 94.

Tue legal position appears to be that if an offence is disclosed, the court will not normally inter- fere with an investigation into the case and will _permit investigation a into the offence alleged to be completed; if, however, the materials do not disclose an offence, no investigation should normally be permitted .... Once an offence is disclosed, an investigation into the offence must necessarily follow in the interests of justice. If, however, no offence is disclosed, an investigation cannot be permitted, as any investigation, in the absence of any offence being b disclosed, will result in unnecessary harassment to a party, whose liberty and property may be put to jeopardy for nothing. The liberty and property of any individual are sacred and sacrosanct and the court zealously guards them and protects them. An investigation is carried on for the purpose of gathering necessary materials for c establishing and proving an offence which is disclosed. When an offence is disclosed, a proper investigation in the interests of justice becomes necessary to collect materials for establishing the offence, and for bringing the offender to book. In the absence of a proper investigation in a case where an offence is disclosed, the offender d may succeed in escaping from the consequences and the offender may go unpunished to the detriment of the cause of justice and the society at large. Justice requires that a person who ccmmits an offence has to be brought to book and must be punished for the same. If the court interferes with the proper investigation in a case where an offence has been disclosed, the offence will go unpunished e to the serious detriment of the welfare of the society and the cause of the justice suffers. It is on the basis of this principle that the court normally does not interfere with the investigation of a case where an offence has been disclosed .... Whether an offence has been dis- closed or not must necessarily depend on the facts and circum- f stances of each particular case .... If on a consideration of the relevant materials, the court is satisfied that an offence is disclosed, the court will normally not interfere with the investigation into the offence and will generally allow the investigation into the offence to be completed for collecting materials for proving the offence.\" g 96. But in the above case, this Court as we have pointed out earlier, quashed the proceedings on the ground that the allegations made in the complaint did not constitute an offence within the ambit of the provi- sions of the Act under which the respondents/accused therein were prosecuted. h 97.

BHAJAN LAL (Pandian, J.) 377 accused can be quashed or set aside and further stating that the same principle laid down in that decision would apply mutatis mutandis to a a criminal complaint also, has explained the position of law in Pratibha Rani v. Suraj Kuma~ as follows: (SCC p. 395, para 59) b C d e f g h i \"It is well settled by a long course of decisions of this Court that for the purpose of exercising its power under Section 482 CrPC to quash a FIR or a complaint the High Court would have to proceed entirely on the basis of the allegations made in the complaint or the documents accompanying the same per se. It has no jurisdiction to examine the correctness or otherwise of the allegations.\" 98. Speaker for the bench, Ranganath Misra, J. as he then was in Madhavrao Jiwaji Rao Scindia v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre29 has expounded the law as follows: (SCC p. 695, para 7) \"The legal position is well settled that when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the offence. It is also for the court ta take into consid- eration any special features which appear in a particular case to con- sider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue. This is so on the basis that the court cannot be utilised for any oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the court chances of an ultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecu- tion to continue, the court may while taking into consideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceedings even though it may be at a preliminary stage.\" 99. Venkatachaliah, J. in State of Bihar v. Murad Ali Khan\"' has stated that the jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code has to be exercised sparingly and with circumspection and bas given the working that in exercising that jurisdiction, the High Court should not embark upon an enquiry whether the allegations in the complaint are likely to be established by evidence or not. 100.

In that case, it has been ruled that if the allegations made in the FIR, taken on the face value and a accepted in their entirety, do not constitute an offence, the criminal proceedings instituted on the basis of such FIR should be quashed. The principle laid down in this case does not depart from the proposition of law consistently propounded in a line of decisions of this court and on the other hand it reiterates the principle that the court can exercise its b inherent jurisdiction of quashing a criminal proceeding only when the allegations made in the FIR do not constitute an offence and that it depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. 102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law c enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the d process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and suffi- ciently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised. e (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cog- nizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a (3) (4) Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or com- plaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cog- nizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code. ~ (1989) 4 sec 59: 1989 scc.(Cri) 713 f g h ; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

BHAJAN LAL (Pandian, J.) 379 (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no pru- dent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is suffi- cient ground for proceeding against the accused. (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act ( under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and con- tinuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing effica- cious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge. 103. We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases; that the court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whim or caprice. 104. It may be true, as repeatedly pointed out by Mr Parasaran, that in a given situation, false and vexatious charges of corruption and venality may be maliciously attributed against any person holding a high office and enjoying a respectable status thereby sullying his character, injuring his reputation and exposing him to social ridicule with a view to spite him on account of some personal rancour, predilections and past prejudices of the complainant. In such a piquant situation, the question is what would be the remedy that would redress the grievance of the verily affected party? The answer would be that the person who dishonestly makes such false allegations is liable to be proceeded against under the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code - namely under Section 182 or 211 or 500 besides becoming liable to be sued for damages. 105. Reverting to the present case, the alleg1;1tions made in the com- plaint, in our considered opinion, do clearly constitute a cognizable offence justifying the registration of a case and an investigation thereon and this case does not fall under any one of the categories of cases for- mulated above calling for the exercise of extraordinary or inherent powers of the High Court to quash the FIR itself. 106.

Much reliance was placed in support of the above submission on three decisions, namely (1) S. Pratap Singh v. State of Punjab 35; (2) State of Haryana v. Rajindra Sareen'34 and (3) Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of lndia 37• 107. We went through the entire materials very scrupulously but we b are not persuaded to hold that the allegations of mala tides or lack of bona fides are substantiated and hence the decisions cited in this behalf cannot be availed of. It may not be out of place to mention here that when respondent 3, Shri Devi Lal in the SLP was given up from the array of parties by the appellant, no objection was raised on behalf of Shri c Bhajan Lal. In fact, the learned Judge of the High Court before whom a similar contention was raised has rightly negatived that contention and heJd that the plea of mala fide as against Shri Devi Lal is not available. Hence there is no merit in this contention. 108. No doubt, there was no love lost between Shri Bhajan Lal and Dharam Pal. Based on this strained relationship, it has been then emphatically urged by Mr K. Parasaran that the entire allegations made d in the complaint due to political vendetta are not only scurrilous and scandalous but also tainted with mala fides, vitiating the entire proceed- e ings. As it has been repeatedly pointed out earlier the entire matter is only at a premature stage and the investigation is not yet proceeded with except some preliminary effort taken on the date of the registration of the case, that is on November 21, 1987. The evidence has to be gathered after a thorough investigation and placed before the court on the basis of 1 which alone the court can come to a conclusion one way or the other on the plea of mala tides. If the allegations are bereft of truth and made maliciously, we are sure, the investigation will say so. At this stage, when there are only allegations and recriminations but no evidence> this court cannot anticipate the result of the investigation and render a finding on g the question of mala tides on the materials at present available. There- fore, we are unable io see any force in the contention that the complaint should be thrown overboard on the mere unsubstantiated plea of mala tides. Even assuming that Dharam Pal has laid the complaint only on account of his personal animosity, that, by itself, will not be a ground to h discard the complaint containing serious allegations which have to be tested and weighed after the evidence is collected.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf STATE OF HARY ANA V. BHAlAN LAL (Pandian, J.) 381 following view expressed by Bhagwati, C.J. in Sheonandan Paswan v. State of Bihar33 may be referred to: (SCC p. 318, para 16) a \"It is a well established proposition of law that a criminal b C prosecution, if otherwise justifiable and based upon adequate evi- dence does not become vitiated on account of mala fides or political vendetta of the first informant or the complainant.\" Beyond the above, we do not wish to add anything more. 109. It was again contended that mala tides are writ large on the extraordinary interest evinced by the police officers and the hasty direc- tion given by the SP. Needless to say that the question of mala fide exercise -0f power will assume significance only if an authority acts for unauthorised purpose. The proper test to be applied in such a case is as to what is the dominant purpose for which the power is exercised. The principle of dominant purpose is explained in the following decisions: (1) King v. Minister of Health 39; (2) Rex v. Brighton Corporation ex- parte Shoosmith◄0; (3) Earl Fitzwilliam's Wentworth Estate Co. Ltd. v. d Minister of Town and Country Planning41 and ( 4) P. V. Jagannath Rao v. e f g h State of Orissa◄2• 110. Applying the test laid down in the above decisions to the present case, we are of the opinion that the dominant purpose of registration of the case and the intended follow up action are only to investigate the allegations and present a case before the court, if suffi- ci(mt evidence in support of those allegations are collected but not to make a character assassination of Shri Bhajan Lal and their relatives. TI1erefore, we are not able to see any substance in this submission. 111. We have, so far, made a detailed and searching analysis on the legal issues with regard to the statutory duty of an officer incharge of a police station in registering the first information report and commencing th1e investigation thereon as well the principles relating to the exercise of extraordinary and inherent powers of the High Court in quashing either th◄e FIR or the entire criminal proceedings as the case may be; and bear- ing in mind the enunciation of law, we have given our anxious considera- tion and careful thought to all the contentions made by all the learned counsel with considerable force and emphasis. The resultant and inescapable logical conclusion which we unreservedly arrive at is that the order of the High Court quashing the first information report, viewed from any angle, cannot be sustained both on the question of law and 38 (1987) 1 sec 288,318: 1987 sec (Cri) 82 39 (1929) 1 KB 619 i 40 96LT762 41 (1951) 2 KB 284 42 (1968) 3 SCR 789: AIR 1969 SC 215 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

Lastly, a fervent, but inexorable plea was made requesting this a Court to take judicial notice of the fact that the Justice Jaswant Singh Commission, appointed to enquire into the allegations of dis- proportionate assets of Shri Bhajan Lal through corrupt means found that these allegations were baseless. Both Shri Devi Lal and Dharam Pal in their affidavits filed before the High Court have stated that the allega- b lions in the FIR are quite different from those which were the subject matter of enquiry before the Justice Jaswant Singh Commission. Be that as it may, we are not inclined to give any finding one way or other merely on the report of the Justice Jaswant Singh Commission by taking judicial notice of the same. c 113. During the course of the hearing of this appeal as we have entertained a doubt as to the validity of the statutory power of the Inspector of Police, appellant 3, herein who is not a designated officer to investigate this case registered under Section 5(2) of the Act [presumably d Section 5(1)(e) read with Section 5(2)] anJ under Sections 161 and 165 IPC in the teeth of the mandatory provisions of Section 5-A and in the light of the observations of this Court made in HN. Rishbud and lnder Singh v. State of Delhi 43 and State of .Madhya Pradesh v. Mubarak Ali 44, all the learned counsel addressed their arguments on this point at the e instance of this Court. Though initially, it was submitted on behalf of the State (appellant 1 herein) that the order of the SP dated November 21, 1987 directing the Inspector to investigate the case would foll within the purview of the provisos to Section 5-A, subsequently two government orders issued by the Government of Haryana - one dated 26-7-1975 f authorising all the Inspectors of Police under the administrative control of the Inspector General of Police, Haryana, to investigate offences under Section 5 of the Act and another dated April 19, 1988 authorising all the Inspectors of Police posted in the Chi~f Minister's Flying Squad, Haryana, Chandigarh for the purpose of the first proviso to Section 5- g A(l) of the Act. It is pertinent to note that both the government orders were issued in exercise of the powers, conferred by the first provisos to sub-section (1) of Section 5-A of the Act. 114.

BHAJAN LAL (Pandian, J.) 383 (a) in the case of the Delhi Special Police Establishment, of an Inspector of Police; (b) in the presidency towns of Calcutta and Madras, of an Assistant Commissioner of Police; (c) in the presidency town of Bombay, of a Superintendent of Police; and (d) elsewhere, of a Deputy Superintendent of Police, shall investigate any offence punishable under Section 161, Sec- tion 165 or Section 165-A of the Indian Penal Code ( 45 of 1860) or under Section 5 of this Act without the order of a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class, as the case may be, or make any arrest therefor without a warrant: Provided that if a police officer not below the rank of an Inspector of Police is authorised by the State Government in this behalf by general or special order, he may also investigate any such offence without the order of a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class, as the case may be, or make arrest therefor without a warrant: Provided further that an offence referred to in clause (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 shall not be investigated without the order of a police officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Police.\" 115. Section 5-A of the Act as it originally stood, was inserted by the Prevention of Corruption (Second Amendment) Act 59 of 1952 based on the recommendations of the committee of Members of Parliament under the chairmanship of Dr Bakshi Tek Chand. The said section as it stands now was substituted by Act 40 of 1964, the main object of which is to protect the public servant against harassment and victimisation. (See State of M.P. v. Mubarak Ali 44 ). In A.C. Sharma v. Delhi Administration◄s, Dua, J. said that the scheme of this provision is for effectively achieving the object of successful investigation into the serious offences mentioned in Section 5 of the Act without unreasonably exposing the public servant concerned to frivolous and vexatious proceedings. A Constitution Bench of this Court in A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak 46 at page 941 has observed that \"Section 5-A is a safeguard against investigation of offences by public servants, by petty or lower rank police officers\". 116. According to Section 5-A, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, no police officer below the rank specified in clauses (a) to (d) of Section 5-A(l), shall investigate any offence punishable under Section 161, 165 or 165-A of the IPC or under Section 5 of the Act 45 (1973) 1 sec 726: 1973 sec (Cri) 608: (1973)3 scR 477 46 (1984) 2 sec soo: 1984 sec (Cri) 277: (1984) 2 scR 914,941 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

There are two provisos to that section. As per the first proviso, if a police a officer not below the rank of an Inspector of Police is authorised by the State Government, either by general or special order, he may investigate any such offence without the order of a Magistrate or make arrest there- for without a warrant. Ac.cording to the second proviso, an offence referred to in clause (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 shall not be b investigated without the order of a police officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Police. 117. It means that a police officer not below the rank of an Inspector of Police authorised by the State Government in terms of the first proviso can take up the investigation of an offence referred to in c clause (e) of Section 5(1) only on a separate and independent order of a police officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Police. To say in other words, a strict compliance of the second proviso is an additional legal requirement to that of the first proviso for conferring a valid authority on a police officer not below the rank of an Inspector of Police d to investigate an offence falling under clause (e) of Section 5(1) of the Act. This is clearly spelt out from the expression \"further provided\" occurring in the second proviso. 118. A conjoint reading of the main provision, Section 5-A(l) and e the two provisos thereto, shows that the investigation by the designated police officer is the rule and the investigation by an officer of a lower rank is an exception. 119. It has been ruled by this Court in several decisions that Sec- tion 5-A of the Act is mandatory and not directory and the investigation f conducted in violation thereof bears the stamp of illegality but that illegality committed in the course of an investigation does not affect the competence and the jurisdiction of the court for trial and where the cog- nizance of the case has in fact been taken and the case is proceeded to termination, the invalidity of the preceding investigation does not vitiate g the result unless miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby.

BHAJAN LAL (Pandian, J.) 385 case◄3 and Muni Lal case50, it has been ruled that if any breach of the said mandatory proviso relating to investigation is brought to the notice of 1the court at an early stage of the trial, the court will have to consider the nature and extent of the violation and pass appropriate orders as may be called for to rectify the iJJegaJity and cure the defects in the investigation. 120. Coming to the facts of the present case under consideration, the investigation did not proceed and could not be proceeded with, since the High Court by an interlocutory order restrained the investigation ,even at the initial stage, i.e. on the date when rule nisi was issued in the writ petition. Therefore, it is the appropriate stage for examination of the question as to whether the necessary requirements contemplated under Section 5-A(l) in permitting the Inspector of Police, are strictly complied with or not. 121. For the proper understanding of the reasoning which we would like to give touching the question of the validity of the authority of appellant 3, we would like to reproduce the Government Order dated July 26, 1975 which reads as follows: No. 4816-3H-75/22965 \"Haryana Government, Home Department, ORDER July 26, 1975 Conferred by the first proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 5-A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, the Governor of Haryana hereby authorises all the Inspectors of Police under the administrative control of the Inspector General of Police, Haryana to investigate offences under Section 5 of the said Act. S.D. Bhandari Secretary to Government, Haryana Home Department\" 122. The subsequent Government Order dated April 19, 1988 is on the same lines of the above government order. 123. On the strength of the above government order of 1975, it has been rightly contended that appellant 3 (Inspector of Police), though not a designated officer has been legally authorised by the State Government in exercise of its powers under the first proviso of Section 5-A(l) to investigate the offences falling under Section 5 of the Act, namely, the offences enumerated in clauses (a) to (e) of Section 5(1) of the Act. 124. Now what remains for consideration is whether there is any valid order of the SP permitting appellant 3 to investigate the offence ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

As we have already mentioned in the earlier part of this judgment, the SP (appellant 2) has given the one word direction on November 21, 1987 'investigate'. The question is whether the one word direction 'investigate• would amount to an 'order' within the meaning of second proviso of Sec- tion 5-A( l ). 125. In H.N. Rishbud case43 at page 1165 while examining the order of a Magistrate contemplated under Section 5-A(l), it has been observed: (SCR p. 1165) \"When a Magistrate is approached for granting such permission a b he is expected to satisfy himself that there are good and sufficient reasons for authorising an officer of a lower rank to conduct the investigation. The granting of such permission is not to be treated by c a Magistrate as a mere matter of routine but it is an exercise of his judicial discretion having regard to the policy underlying it. In our opinion, therefore, when such a breach is brought to the notice of the court at an early stage of the trial the court will have to consider the nature and extent of the violation and pass appropriate orders d for such re-investigation as may be called for , wholly or partly .... \" 126. The above dictum has been approved in Mubarak Ali case«, the facts of which disclose that the District Magistrate before whom an application was submitted by the Sub-Inspector seeking permission under Section 5-A passed the order reading \"permission granted\". Subba e Rao, J. as he then was while speaking for the bench disapproved such casual order and expressed that the Magistrate did not realise the sig- nificance of this order giving permission but only mechanically issued the order and stated thus: (SCR p. 210) f \" ... in a case where an officer other than the designated officer, seeks to make an investigation, he should get the order of a Magistrate empowering him to do so before he proceeds to investigate and it is desirable that the order giving the permission should ordinarily, on the face of it, disclose the reasons for giving the permission.\" 127. Hegde, J. in S.N. Bose case4Q following the maxim in Mubarak Ali case\"\" has expressed _!J.is opinion in the following words: (SCR p. 568) \"It is surprising that even after this Court pointed out the sig- nificance of Section 5-A in several decisions there are still some Magistrates and police officers who continue to act in a casual man- ner. It is obvious that they are ignorant of the decisions of this Court.\" 128.

BHAJAN I..AL (Pandian, J.) 387 rank to conduct the investigation is not to be treated by a Magistrate as a mere matter of routine, but it is an exercise of his judicial discretion having regard to the policy underlying and the order giving the permis- sion should, on the face of it, disclose the reasons for granting such permission. It is, t~erefore, clear in the light of the above principle of law that the Superintendent of Police or any police officer of above rank while granting permission to a non-designated police officer in exercise of his power under the second proviso to Section 5-A( 1 ), should satisfy himself that there are good and sufficient reasons to entrust the investigation with such police officer of a lower rank and reco_rd his reasons for doing so; because the very object of the legislature in enact- ing Section 5-A is to see that the investigation of offences punishable under Section 161, 165 or 165-A of Indian Penal Code as well as those under Section 5 of the Act should be done ordinarily by the officers designated in clauses (a) to (d) of Section 5-A(l). The exception should be for adequate reasons which should be disclosed on the face of the order. In this connection, it is worthy to note that the strict compliance with Section 5-A(l) becomes absolutely necessary, because Section 5- A(l) expressly prohibits police officers, below certain ranks, from investigating into offences under Sections 161, 165 and 165-A, IPC and under Section 5 of the Act without orders of Magistrates specified there- in or without authorisation of the State Government in this behalf and from effecting arrests for those offences without a warrant. See alsoA.C. Sharma v. DelhiAdministration◄ 5 • 129. In the present case, there is absolutely no reason, given by the SP in directing the SHO to investigate and as such the order of the SP is directly in violation of the dictum laid down by this Court in several deci- sions which we have referred to above. Resultantly, we hold that appel- lant 3, SHO is not clothed with the requisite legal authority within the meaning of the second proviso of Section 5-A(l) of the Act to investigate the offence under clause ( e) of Section 5( 1) of the Act. 130. There is also one more legal hurdle which the prosecution has to overcome in entrusting this investigation with the SHO. As has been repeatedly mentioned the case under consideration is not only registered under Section 5(2) but also under Sections 161 and 165 IPC. The gov- ernment order authorises the Inspector of Police of Haryana State to investigate only the offences falling under Section 5 of the Act. There- fore, the SHO who has taken up the investigation of the offences inclusive of those under Sections 161 and 165 IPC is not at all clothed with any authority to investigate these two offences, registered under the IPC, apart from the offence under Section 5(2) of the Act.

However, as the question relating to the legal authority of the SHO is raised even at this initial stage, we feel that it would be proper and also desirable that the investig~tion, if at all to be proceeded with in the opinion of the State Government, should proceed only on the basis of a valid order in strict compliance with the mandatory provision of Sec- b tion 5-A(l). 131. From the above discussion, we hold that (1) as the salutary legal requirement of disclosing the reasons for according the permission is not complied with; (2) as the p,osecution is not satisfactorily explaining the circumstances which impelled the SP to pass the order directing the SHO c to investigate the case; (3) as the said direction manifestly seems to have been granted mechanically and in a very casual manner, regardless of the principles of law enunciated by this Court, probably due to blissful ignorance of the legal mandate and ( 4) as, above all, the SHO has got neither any order from the Magistrate to investigate the offences under d Sections 161 and 165 IPC nor any order from the SP for investigation of the offence under Section 5(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act in the manner known to law, we have no other option, save to quash that order of direction, reading \"investigate\" which direction suffers from legal infirmity and also the investigation, if any, so far carried out. e Nevertheless, our order of quashing the direction of the SP and the investigation thereupon will not in any way deter appellant 1, the State of Haryana to pursue the matter and direct an investigation afresh in pur- suance of the FIR, the quashing of which we have set aside, if the State f so desires, through a competent police officer, clothed with the legal authority in strict compliance with Section 5-A(l) of the Act. 132. The learned Judgces of the High Court before parting with their conclusions not being \"able to resist temptation\" of making an obseIVa- tion with a textual passage which is more or less suggestive of an advice g have expressed as fo11ows! \"Besides what has been said and obseIVed above, before part- ing with this case, we have not been able to resist the temptation of saying that every politician in Haryana may be the Chief Minister or otherwise, should not while holding office act on the maxim, 'Every- h thing is fair in love and war' but should be sanguine and careful to mete out to his predcecessor, a treatment in the words of Porus, uttered while in chains, on being brought before Alexander the Great, 'a treatment which a king should mete out to another king' because it is often said 'as you sow, so shall you reap'.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.

Mr Rajinder Sachar and Mr R.K Garg submitted with strong intensity of conviction that the above observation of the learned Judges a should not be countenanced because if such observations, especially in the context of this case receive judicial recognition, it will lead only to the catastrophe of our democratic system to the detriment of the welfare of the country and if such observations are accepted then every successor government should bury its head like an ostrich thereby freely allowing b the malfeasance and misfeasance of the former government to go unnoticed, unrectified and the offenders unpunished. According to them there is absolutely no material for holding that there was any campaign of vilification for political gain based on personal animus by the successor government as against the outgoing government, particularly when the c criminal proceedings are initiated by an individual. 134. To buttress their submission. they relied on the following deci- sions dealing with similar contentions attacking the institution of criminal proceedings characterising them as the outcome of political vendetta. d Those decisions being - (1) P. V. Jagannath Rao v. State of Orissa52; (2) Krishna Ballabh Sahay v. Commission of Enquiry53; (3) Sheonandan Pas- wan v. State of Bihar54; ( 4) Sheonandan Paswan v. State of Bihar55 and (5) A.R Antu.lay v. RS. Nayak5'. e f g h i 135. It would be appropriate to refer to the observations made by this Court in two of the above decisions. 136. In Krishna Ballabh Sahay case53 at page 393, Hidayatullah, C.J. speaking for the Constitution Bench has pointed out: \"It hardly needs any authority to state that the inquiry will be ordered not by the Minister against himself but by someone else. When a Ministry goes out of office, its successor may consider any glaring charges and may, if justified, order an inqpiry. Otherwise, each Ministry will become a law unto itself and the corrupt conduct of its Ministers will remain beyond scrutiny.\" 137. InA.R Antulay case54 at page 673, Sabyasachi Mukharji, J. (as he then was) speaking for himself and two other learned Judges expressed his opinion on a similar issue in the following words: (SCC p. 673, para 85) \" ... we must remind ourselves that purity of public life is one o( the cardinal principles which must be upheld as a matter of public policy.

Even if he has been wronged, if he is allowed to be left in doubt that would cause more serious damage to a the appellant. Public confidence in public administration should not be eroded any further. One wrong cannot be remedied by another wrong.\" 138. We feel that the following observation made by Krishna Iyer, J. in State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh51 may be recapitulated in this connec- b tion, that being: (SCC p. 475, para 9) \"If the use of the power is for the fulfilment of a legitimate object the actuation or catalysation by mali~ is not legicidal.\" 139. In the light of the above decisions of this Court, we feel that the said observations made in the impugned judgment are unwarranted and c the historical anecdote is out of context and inappropriate. We are afraid if such a view is to be judicially accepted and approved, then it will be tantamount to laying down an alarming proposition that an incoming government under all circumstances, should put its seal of approval to all the commissions and omissions of the outgoing government ignoring d even glaring lapses and serious misdeeds and the deleterious and destruc- tive consequences that may follow therefrom. Hence we are constrained to express our disapproval since the text, tenor and. tone of the above observations leave us with the feeling that such misplaced sympathy indi- cated therein appears to have considerably weighed with the learned e Judges in taking the extreme step in quashing the first information report. We do not like to make any more comment except saying that as we have pointed out in our exordial note, in our democratic polity where the 'Rule of Law' reigns no one - however highly placed he may be - f can claim immunity, much less absolute immunity from the Law, but he is always under the law. In summation 140. We set aside the judgment of the High Court quashing the first information report as not being legally and factually sustainable in law g for the reasons aforementioned; but, however, we quash the commence- ment as well as the entire investigation, if any, so far done for the reasons given by us in the instant judgment on the ground that appellant 3 (SHO) is not clothed with valid legal authority to take up the investiga- tion and proceed with the same within the meaning of Section 5-A(l) of h the Prevention of Corruption Act as indicated in this judgment. Further we set aside the order of the High Court awarding costs with a direction that the said costs is payable to respondent 1 (Shri Bhajan Lal) by respondent 2 (Dharam Pal). 57 (1980)2SCC471: (1980) 1 SCR 1071 ; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: Supreme Court Cases, © 2023 Eastern Book Company.
