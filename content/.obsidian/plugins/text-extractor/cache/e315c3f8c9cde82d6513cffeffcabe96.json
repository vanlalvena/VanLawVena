The punishment for fraud involving an amount of at least Rs.10 lakhs or 1 per cent of the turnover of the Company, is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years. Thefence. Chapter XIV of 2013 Act deals with Inspection, Inquiry and Investigation. Under Section 210,1 contemplates establishment of Serious Fraud Investigation Offence (SFIO) which is to be headed by aector and is to consist of Experts with ability, integrity and experience in fields like Banking, Corporate Affairs, Taxation, Forensic Audit, Capital Market, Information Technology, Law or such other fields.

If a time limit is construed and contemplated within which the investigation must, the provisions would have dealt with as to what must happen if the time limit is not adhered to. Thetatute must also have contemplated a situation that a valid investigation undertaken by any Investigating Agency of Central Government or State Government which was transferred to SFIO, must then be re-transferred to said Investigating Agencies. But the Statute does not contemplate that. The transfer is irrevocable and cannot be recalled in any manner. Once assigned, SFIO continues to have the power to conduct and completeticular period.

Even after the expiry of such stipulated period, the mandate in favour of the the orders passed by Director, SFIO was in any way illegal or unauthorised by law.

These decisions were considered in Kanu Sanyal vs. District Magistrate, Darjeeling and Others8, as under: Re: Grounds A and B. 4. These two grounds relate exclusively to the legality of the initial detention of the petitioner in the District Jail, Darjeeling. We think it unnecessary to decide them. It is now well settled that the 1 (1945) 7 FCR 81 2 (1952) SCR 395 3 (1953) SCR 652, 4 (1966) 2 SCR 427 5 (1970) 3 SCC 926 6 (1971) 3 SCC 118 7 (1972) 3 SCC 256 8 (1974) 4 SCC 141 A B D E F G H 115 challenged in a habeas corpus proceeding may be examined isThis Court speaking through Wanchoo, J., (as he then was) said in A.K. Gopalan v. Government of India 5: “It is well settled that in dealing with the petition for habeas corpus, namely, Naranjan Singh v. State of Punjab 2 and Ram Narayan Singh v. State of Delhi 3 a slightly different view was expressed and that view was reiterated by this Court in B.R. Rao v. State of Orissa 7 where it was said (at p. 259, para 7): Talib Hussain v. State of Jammu & Kashmir 6 Mr Justice Dua, sitting as a Single Judge, presumably in the vacation, observed that (at p. 121, para 6):, the earliest date with reference to which the legality of detention may be examined is the date of filing of the SERIOUS FRAUD INVESTIGATION OFFICE v. RAHUL MODI [UDAY UMESH LALIT, J.] A B D E F G H 116 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R. words of Mr JusticeDua in B.R. Rao v.

The initial detention of the petitioner in the District Jail, Darjeeling had comeVizakhapatnam is legal or not. Even if we assume that grounds A and B are well founded and there was infirmity in the detention of the petitioner in the DistrictVizakhapatnam. See para 7 of the judgment of this Court in B.R. Rao v. State of Orissa. The legality of the detention of the petitioner in the Central Jail,izakhapatnam would have to be judged on its own merits. We, therefore, consider it unnecessary to embark on a discussion ofA and B and decline to decide them.” The law is thus clear that “in Habeas Corpus proceedings a Court is to have regard to the legality or otherwise of the detention at the timeKanu Sanyal8 the validity of the detention of the petitioner in District Jail, Darjeeling was therefore not considered by this Court and it wasVishakhapatnam. 18. At this stage we may also deal with three recent cases decided by this Court:- A) In Manubhai Ratilal Patel through Ushaben vs. State of Gujarat and others9 a Division bench of this Court extensively considered earlier decisions in the point including cases referred to above.(2013) 1 SCC 314 A B D E F G H 117 The observations of this Court in paragraphs 20 to 24 and para 31 were 20. After so stating, the Bench in Kanu Sanyal case 8 opined that for adjudication in the said case, it was immaterial which of theB. Ramachandra Rao 7 wherein the Court had expressed the view in the following manner: (SCC p. 259)7. … in habeas corpus proceedings the court is to have regard to the legality or otherwise of the detention at the time of the return, the Bench ruled thus: (Kanu Sanyal case8, SCC p. 148, para 5)5. … The production of the petitioner before the Special Judge, Visakhapatnam, could not, therefore, be said to be illegal and his subsequent detention in the Central Jail, Visakhapatnam, pursuant to the orders made by the Special Judge, Visakhapatnam, pending trial must be held to be valid. This Court pointed out in Col. B. Ramachandra Rao v. State of Orissa7 (SCC p. 258, para 5) that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be granted The principle laid down in Kanu Sanyal8, thus, is that any infirmity in the detention of the petitioner at the initial stage cannot At this juncture, we may profitably refer to the Constitution Bench decision in Sanjay Dutt v. State through CBI, Bombay (II)10 wherein it has been opined thus: (SCC p. 442, para 48) “48. … It is settled by Constitution Bench decisions that a petition seeking the writ of habeas corpus on the ground of absence of a.” SERIOUS FRAUD INVESTIGATION OFFICE v.

Keeping in view the aforesaid concepts with regard to the writ of habeas corpus, especially pertaining to an order passed by. 24.

This requires the investigating agency to send the case diary along with the. … … … 31. Coming to the case at hand, it is evincible that the arrest had taken place a day prior to the passing of the order of stay. It is also manifest that the order of remand was passed by the learned. It has to be borne in mind that the effect of the order of the High Court regarding stay of investigation. The order of remand which is a judicial act, as we perceive, doesfer from any infirmity. The only ground that was highlighted before the High Court as well as before this Court is that once A B D E F G H 119 there is stay of investigation, the order of remand is sensitively, the detention is unsustainable. It is worthy to note that the investigation had already. It is well-accepted principle that a writ of habeas corpus is not to be entertained when a personAs has been stated in B. Ramachandra Rao3 and Kanu Sanyal 9, the court is required to scrutinise the legality or otherwise of the order of detention which has been passed. Unless the court, a writ of habeas corpus cannot be granted. It is apposite to note that the investigation, as has been dealt with in.” B) In Saurabh Kumar vs. Jailor, Koneila Jail and another 11 the issue was dealt with in para 13 of the leading Judgment as under:- 13. It is clear from the said narration of facts that the petitioner is in judicial custody by virtue of an order passed by the JudicialAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dalsingsarai, District Samastipur, Bihar.

However, the petitioner is at liberty to make an application for his release inAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dalsingsarai.” Thakur, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) who agreed with the leading Judgment authored by Ramana, J., also dealt with the “22. The only question with which we are concerned within the above backdrop is whether the petitioner can be said to be in the. Our answer to that question is in the negative. The record which we have carefully perused shows that theA writ of habeas corpus is, in the circumstances, totally misplaced. Having said that, we are of the, having regard to the nature of the offences allegedly committed by the petitioner and the attendant circumstances. Thegement from custody.” C) A Bench of three learned Judges of this Court in State of Maharashtra and Others vs. Tasneem Rizwan Siddiquee12 concluded as under:- “10. The question as to whether a writ of habeas corpus could be maintained in respect of a person who is in police custody pursuantSaurabh Kumar v. Jailor, Koneila Jail11 and Manubhai Ratilal Patel9 v.

Reverting to the prayer for expunging the scathing observations made in the impugned judgment, in particular paras 4-6, reproduced, it is submitted that the said observations were wholly unwarranted as the Deputy Commissioner of Police concernedAlam Siddiquee in the teeth of a judicial order passed by the Magistrate directing police remand until 23-3-2018., it is evident that the High Court proceeded to make observations without giving any opportunity, whatsoever, to the police officials concerned to explain the factual position on affidavit. 2 when the Court called upon the advocate for the appellants to produce the record on the next day i.e. 21-3-2018. 1, notwithstanding the judicial order of remand operating tills husband could be released if so directed by the Court. As aforesaid, the DCP has had no other option but to make such a submission. For, he could not have voluntarily released the accused who was in police custody Suffice it to observe that since no writ of habeas corpus could be issued in the fact situation of the present case, the High Court SERIOUS FRAUD INVESTIGATION OFFICE v.

However, they did not raise such challenge before the competent Appellate or Revisional Forum.

These orders were not put in challenge before the High Court. It was, therefore, not openThe High Court, however, considered the matter from the standpoint whether the initial Order of arrest itself was valid or not and, the issue which was raised before the High Court was whether the arrest could be effected after period of investigation,(2004) 5 SCC 729 A B D E F G H 123 14.12.2018. It is true that the arrest was effected when the period hadAdditionally, there were judicial orders passed by the Judicial Magistrate as well as the Special Court, Gurugram, remanding the accused. If we go purely by the law laid down by this Court with regard to exercise of jurisdiction in respect of Habeas Corpus petition,. 20. We must, however, deal with the submission advanced on behalf of the original Writ Petitioners that the relief as regards Habeas Corpus was a secondary prayer while the principal submissions wereWrit Petitioner such an extension could not cure the inherent defect and as such, the High CourtWe may deal with this issue after considering the second question posed by the High Court in said 21.

If the act of directing remand is fundamentally a judicialAct, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition. However, since the High Court considered the matter from the standpoint whether. 25. At the outset, we may extract relevant statutory provisions. A) Sections 211 and 212 of 2013 Act are as under:- “211.

B) Section 43 of 2008 Act is as under:- “43.

Reading of the provisions of 2013 Act shows that certain Sections in Chapter XXIX prescribe punishment for offences such as. The punishment for fraud involving an amount of at least Rs.10 lakhs or 1 per cent of the turnover, is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years. The offence of fraud in relation to the affairs of a Company isfence. Chapter XIV of 2013 Act deals with Inspection, Inquiry and Investigation. Under Section 210, investigation into the affairs1 contemplates establishment of Serious Fraud Investigation Offence (SFIO) which is, integrity and experience in fields like Banking, Corporate Affairs, Taxation, Forensic Audit, Capital Market, Information Technology, Law or such other fields. SFIO headed by a Director is thus a compact and competentassign the investigation”. Sub-Section (2) incorporates an important principle that upon such assignment by the Central Government to SFIO,Act and is bound to transfer the documents and records in respect of such offence under 2013 Act to SFIO. A B D E F G H 133 27. Under sub-Section (3) where the investigation is so assigned by the Central Government to SFIO, the investigation must be conducted1). Further, according to sub-Section (12), on completion of the investigation, SFIO is to submit the “investigation report” to the Central. The “investigation report” under sub-Section (12) is to be submitted on completion of the investigation whereas report under sub-Section1) is in the nature of an interim report and is to be submitted if the Central Government so directs. In the backdrop of these provisions weAct do not postulate any such period and the assignment in the present case to SFIO was under the concerned provisions of 2013Act. 28. Section 212(3) of 2013 Act by itself does not lay down any fixed period within which the report has to be submitted. Even under. For instance, there is no fixed period within which the investigation under Criminal SERIOUS FRAUD INVESTIGATION OFFICE v. RAHUL MODI [UDAY UMESH LALIT, J.] A B D E F G H 134 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R. favour of the Accused. But it is certainly not the idea that in case the investigation is not over within any fixed period, the authority to investigate Again, sub-Section (2) of Section 213 of 2013 Act does not speak of any period for which the other Investigating Agencies are to hold their hands, nor does the provision speak of any re-transfer of the relevantAgencies after any period or occurring of an event. For example, under Section 6Agency Act, 2008 (“NIA Act” for short) the Agency (NIA) can be directed by the Central Government to investigate the Scheduled Offence under the NIA Act and where such direction is given, the State Government is not to proceed with any pendingAgency (NIA). But under Section 7 of NIA Act, the Agency may, with previous approval, transfer the case to the State Government for investigation and trial of the offence. 29. The very expression “assign” in Section 212(3) of 2013 Act contemplates transfer of investigation for all purposes whereafter theAgencies of the Central Government or any State Government are completely denuded of any power to conduct and. If a time limit is construed and contemplated within which the investigation must be completed then, the provisions would have dealt with as to what must happen if the time limit is not adhered to. The Statute must also have contemplated. Once assigned, SFIO continues to have the power to conduct and complete investigation18. If that be so, can such power stand curtailed or diminished if the investigation The decision of this Court in KaziLhendupDorji vs. State of Sikkim &Ors reported in (1994) Supp. 2 SCC 116 (para 16), though in a different situation, laid down that A B D E F G H 135 is not completed within a particular period. The Statute has not prescribed 30. It is well settled that while laying down a particular procedure if no negative or adverse consequences are contemplated for non-. Furthermore, the provision has to be seen in the context in which it occurs in the 1. Absolute transfer of investigation in terms of Section 212(2) of 2013 Act in favour of SFIO and upon such transfer all documents and records are required to be transferred to SFIO by every otherAgency. 2. For completion of investigation, sub-Section (12) of Section1) of Section 212 there could be interim reports as and when directed. the prescription of period within which a report is to be submitted byAgencies which were directed to transfer the entire record under sub-Section (2) of Section, an interpretation that with the expiry of the period, the mandate in favour of SFIO mustAgencies would be denuded of power to investigate and with the expiry of mandate SERIOUS FRAUD INVESTIGATION OFFICE v. RAHUL MODI [UDAY UMESH LALIT, J.] A B D E F G H 136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R. 212 is purely directory. Even after the expiry of such stipulated period, the mandate in favour of the SFIO and the assignment of investigation, SFIO was in any way illegal or unauthorised by law. In any case, extension was granted in the present case by the Central Government on 14.12.2018. But that is, the High Court completely erred in proceeding on that premise and in passing the order under appeal. 31. These appeals therefore deserve to be allowed and the Order under appeal must be set aside. Since the writ petitioners were directed (a) The Order dated 20.12.2018 passed by the High Court in W.P. (Crl.) No.3842 of 2018 and in W.P. (Crl.) No.3843 of 2018 is set aside. (b) The writ petitioners namely Rahul Modi and Mukesh Modi are directed to surrender and remain present on 01.04.2019 at 11.00 a.m. before the Special Court, Gurugram. The Special Court may then. (c) In case, said writ petitioners do not appear on the day and at the time stipulated above, the personal bonds executed by them and the (d) The writ petitioners shall file affidavits of compliance in this Court by 08.04.2019. 32. Transfer Petition (Crl.) No.35 of 2019 was filed by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and Deputy Director, SFIO (Original Respondents seeking transfer of Writ Petition (Crl.) No.3960 of 2018. Said writ petition preferred on 21.12.2018 by Vivek Harivyasi claimed similar relief as was granted by the High Court in Writ Petition (Crl) Nos.3842 and 3843 of 2018 on 21.12.2018. However, before the writ A B D E F G H 137 petition could be taken up, the decision of the High Court dated 20.12.2018Transfer Petition (Crl.) No.35 of 2019 seeking transfer of Writ Petition (Crl.) No.3960 of 2018 was also preferred. 33. On 08.03.2019 learned counsel appearing for Vivek Harivyasi submitted that his client would prefer an application for bail before the “The respondent No.1 in T.P. (Crl.)

In the end, we must state that we have not and shall not be taken to have expressed any opinion on merits of the matter which shall ABHAY MANOHAR SAPRE, J. 1. I have had the advantage of going through an elaborate, well considered and scholarly draft judgment proposed by my esteemed brother 2. I entirely agree with the reasoning and the conclusion, which my erudite brother has drawn, which are based on remarkably articulate, having regard to the nature of the controversy, I wish to add a few words of mine. 3. One of the questions which fell for consideration in these appeals and was ably argued at length by the learned senior counsel for both theAct, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) and, in particular, whether the compliance of sub-section (3) of Section 212 of the Act is mandatory or directory and, if so, why. SERIOUS FRAUD INVESTIGATION OFFICE v. RAHUL MODI A B D E F G H 138 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R. 4. As rightly reasoned out by my learned brother Lalit, J., having regard to the scheme of the Act underlined in Chapter XIV (Sections 206 to 229 of the Act) dealing with the matters relating to inspection, inquiry and investigation of the companies in juxtaposition with Chapterfences specified under the Act, the compliance of sub-section (3) of Section 212 of the Act is essentially directory. 5. If the submission of the learned counsel for the respondents (writ petitioners) that the compliance of sub-section (3) of Section 212Act in relation to the submission of the report be held mandatory is accepted (which I am afraid, I cannot accept) in our view, the very purpose of enacting Section 212 of the Act would get defeated and will become nugatory. 6. Indeed, when I apply the well-known principle of purposive interpretation while interpreting the relevant provisions in juxtapositionAct is directory in nature, it serves the legislative intent for which Chapter XXIX is enacted. 7. I, therefore, agree with the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by brother Justice Lalit on the interpretation of sub-section (3) ofAct. 8. In the light of what is held above, the other arguments of learned counsel for the respondents do not survive for consideration. 9. So far as the other issues are concerned, brother Lalit, J. has dealt with them succinctly. I entirely agree with him. Nidhi Jain Matters disposed of.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
