Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - S. 34 - Relief that may be granted - Held, court cannot correct errors of arbitrator(s) - It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is so desired Four contracts were awarded by ONGC in favour of Bum Standard Company Limited (for short \"BSCL\") for fabrication, transportation and installation of six platforms and associated pipelines, to be installed in ONGC's Bombay High Sea. The said contracts contained arbitration agreements. BSCL and McDermott International Inc. (\"MU\") entered into a sub- contractual agreement with regard to the fabrication and installation of offshore platforms, on a project-by-project basis. BSCL retained the job of fabrication of the ED and EE decks, six helidecks and procurement of materials for the overall project other than pipeline materials and some process equipment which was issued by ONGC, sub-contracting the remaining work to MII. The said agreement contained a separate arbitration clause between the parties. In terms of a letter of intent dated 14-9-1984 a contract was entered into by and between BSCL and ONGC. A part of the said contract work was assigned to MII on or about 1-1-1986. The work under the said sub-contract agreement was to be completed within 24 months but in all respects it was completed in early 1989. Disputes and differences having arisen between the parties, MII invoked the arbitration clause. BSCL having challenged the various partial/interim awards and final award of the arbitrator under Section 34, Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (\"1996 Act\") before the Supreme Court (as per the order of the Supreme Court appointing the arbitrator), the parties were before the Supreme Court. t From the Judgment and Order dated 8-5-1998 of the High Court of Calcutta in AP No. 237 of 1997 : (1999) 1 ICC 656 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 182 SUPREME COURT CASES (2006) 11 sec Disposing of the application in the terms below, the Supreme Court Held: In terms of the 1996 Act, a departure was made so far as the jurisdiction of a the court to set aside an arbitral award is concerned vis-a-vis the earlier Act. Whereas under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act, the power of the court was wide, Section 34 of the 1996 Act brings about certain changes envisaged thereunder. Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 did not contain the expression \"error of law .... \". The same was added by judicial interpretation. (Paras 46 and 48) b While interpreting Section 30 of the 1940 Act, a question had been raised before the courts as to whether the principle of law applied by the arbitrator was (a) erroneous or otherwise, or (b) wrong principle was applied. If, however, no dispute existed as on the date of invocation, the question could not have been gone into by the arbitrator. (Para 48) The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is c envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be justified as the parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's d jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it. (Para 52) The arbitral award can be set aside if it is contrary to (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; ( b) the interests of India; ( c) justice or morality; or ( d) if it is patently illegal or arbitrary. Such patent illegality, however, must go to the root of the matter. The public policy violation, indisputably, should be so unfair and unreasonable as to shock the conscience of the court. Lastly, where the arbitrator, e however, has gone contrary to or beyond the expressed law of the contract or granted relief in the matter not in dispute, would come within the purview of Section 34 of the Act. (Paras 58 and 59) What would constitute public policy is a matter dependant upon the nature of transaction and nature of statute. For the said purpose, the pleadings of the parties and the materials brought on record would be relevant to enable the court f to judge what is in public good or public interest, and what would otherwise be injurious to the public good at the relevant point, as contradistinguished from the policy of a particular Government.

The conduct of the parties would also be a relevant factor in the matter of construction of a contract. The construction of the contract agreement is within the jurisdiction of the arbitrators having regard to the wide nature, scope and ambit of the arbitration agreement and they cannot be said to have misdirected themselves in passing the award by taking into consideration the conduct of the parties. Correspondences exchanged by the parties are required to be taken into consideration for the purpose of construction of a contract. Interpretation of a contract is a matter for the arbitrator to determine, even if it gives rise to determination of a question of law. Once it is held that the arbitrator had the jurisdiction, no further question shall be raised and the court will not exercise its jurisdiction unless it is found that there exists any bar on the face of the award.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Ss. 34, 31 and 2(c) - a Awards that may be challenged under S. 34 - Held, both partial/interim award and the final award are subject-matter of challenge under S. 34 The 1996 Act does not use the expression \"partial award\". It uses \"interim award\" or \"final award\". An award has been defined under Section 2( c) to include an interim award. Section 31 ( 6) contemplates an interim award. An interim award in terms of the said provision is not one in respect of which a final award can be made, but it may be a final award on the matters covered thereby, b but made at an interim stage. (Para 68) As would appear from the partial award of the arbitrator in the present case, he deferred some claims. He further expressed his hope and trust that in relation to some claims, the parties would arrive at some sort of settlement having regard to the fact that ONGC directly or indirectly was involved therein. While in relation to some of the claims, a finality was attached to the award, certain claims c were deferred so as to enable the arbitrator to advert thereto at a later stage. (Para 69) A partial award is not akin to a preliminary decree. On the other hand it is final in all respects with regard to disputes referred to the arbitrator which are subject-matters of such award. (Para 70) Some arbitrators instead and in place of using the expression \"interim award\" use the expression \"partial award\". By reason thereof the nature and d character of an award is not changed. As, for example in arbitral proceedings conducted under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, the expression \"partial award\" is generally used by the arbitrators in place of interim award. In any view of the matter, BSCL is not in any way prejudiced. (Para 70) Further, both the partial award and the final award are subject-matter of e challenge under Section 34 of the Act. (Para 70) The additional award given in the present case is not vitiated in law. (Para 71) H.

A stipulation for commissioning of ED and EE platforms within a time-frame has also been mentioned i.e. February 1986. MII served a notice on 10-4-1998 invoking the arbitration agreement. The same would not mean that it should have repudiated the contract as soon as the 20 months' schedule fixed by the contract expired. Delay and disruptions might have occurred for various reasons. In the instant case, therefore, the matter would be covered by the second part of Section 55 of the Contract Act, 1872 providing that where the parties did not intend time to be of the essence of the contract, the contract was not voidable, but the promisee was entitled to compensation for loss occasioned. For the aforementioned purpose, no notice was required to be served. In any event, the contract provided for extension of time. The parties, furthermore, agreed for payment of liquidated damages. Moreover, the contract itself contains provisions for extension of its terms and payment of damages in case of delay in execution of the contract. (Paras 72 to 75 and 84) Arvsan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India, (1999) 9 SCC 449, cited MII states that it had never raised a contention that time was of the essence of the contract, but the claim arises in view of the delay caused in completion of the contract for a period of 34 months and consequent escalation of costs. The price payable in terms of the sub-contract did not adequately cover the increased costs incurred by MII. On a plain reading of the provisions of Section 55 of the Contract Act, 1872 it is evident that as the parties did not intend that time was to be of the essence of the contract on the expiry whereof the contract became voidable at the instance of one of the parties, but by reason thereof the parties shall never be deprived of damages. BSCL had never pleaded before the arbitrator that the time was of the essence of the contract. In construction contracts generally time is not of the essence of the contract unless special features exist therefor. No such special features, in the instant case, have been shown to have existed.

Once such a claim was made prior to invocation, it became a dispute within the meaning of the provisions of the 1996 Act. The same claim was specifically referred to arbitration by MII in terms of its notice dated 10-4- 1989. In fact BSCL never raised any plea before the arbitrator that the said claim was arbitrary or beyond its authority. Such an objection was required to be raised by BSCL before the arbitrator in terms of Section 16 of the 1996 Act. The b Supreme Court even prior to the enactment of a provision like Section 16 of the 1996 Act has clearly held that it is open to the parties to enlarge the scope of reference by inclusion of fresh disputes and they must be held to have done so when they file their statements putting forward claims not covered by the original reference.

(Paras 89, 96 and 92) The claim as regards procurement of structural material related to damages. According to MII, the said claim did not strictly relate to a claim under the contract. BSCL was required to procure the steel and as it was not in a position to do so, MII had agreed to procure steel on its behalf, provided it agreed to cover MII's cost for accelerated procurement, material priced premiums, order fixing costs and other incidental charges. Such a claim was the subject-matter of correspondence which passed between the parties. Receipt of such letters from MII is not denied or disputed by BSCL. The right reserved by MII to claim such additional costs towards procurement of the materials on behalf of BSCL was not denied or disputed and the same is explicitly provided for in the relevant clause of the contract. Only pursuant to or in furtherance of the said correspondence, had procurement on the said basis been undertaken by MII and acceptance of BSCL in this behalf was presumed.

(Paras 109 and 102) a There is nothing in Indian law to show that any of the formulae adopted in other countries is prohibited in law or the same would be inconsistent with the law prevailing in India. As computation depends on circumstances and methods to compute damages, how the quantum thereof should be determined is a matter which would fall for the decision of the arbitrator. Different formulae can be applied in different circumstances and the question as to whether damages should be computed by taking recourse to one or the other formula, having b regard to the facts and circumstances of a particular case, would eminently fall within the domain of the arbitrator. The arbitrator quantified the claim by taking recourse to the Emden Formula. The arbitrator also referred to other formulae, but opined that the Emden Formula is a widely accepted one. If the arbitrator, therefore, applied the Emden Formula in assessing the amount of damages, he cannot be said to have committed an error warranting interference by the c Supreme Court. (Paras 109, 110, 103, 106 and 107) M.N. Gangappa v. Atmakur Nagabhushanam Setty & Co., (1973) 3 SCC 406,jollowed Lavarack v. Woods of Colchester Ltd., (1967) 1 QB 278 : (1966) 3 All ER 683 : (1966) 3 WLR 706 (CA), approved A court of law or an arbitrator may insist on some proof of actual damages, and may not allow the parties to take recourse to one formula or the other. In a d given case, the court of law or an arbitrator may even prefer one formula as against another. But, only because the arbitrator in the facts and circumstances of the case has allowed MII to prove its claim relying on or on the basis of Emden Formula, the same by itself would not lead to the conclusion that it was in breach of Section 55 or Section 73 of the Contract Act, 1872. (Para 115) The person concerned who computed the loss for MII indisputably at one point of time or the other was associated with MII. He applied the Emden e Formula while calculating the amount of damages having regard to the books of accounts and other documents maintained by MII. The arbitrator did insist that sufferance of actual damages must be proved by bringing on record books of accounts and other relevant documents. (Para 108) Although the Hudson Formula has received judicial support in many cases, it has been criticised principally because it adopts the head office overhead percentage from the contract as the factor for calculating the costs, and this may f bear little or no relation to the actual head office costs of the contractor. (Para 104) Using the Emden Formula, the head office overhead percentage is arrived at by dividing the total overhead cost and profit of the contractor's organisation as a whole by the total turnover. This formula has the advantage of using the contractor's actual head office overhead and profit percentage rather than those g contained in the contract. This formula has been widely applied and has received judicial support in a number of cases. (Para 104) The Eichleay Formula is used where it is not possible to prove loss of opportunity and the claim is based on actual cost. It can be seen from the formula that the total head office overhead during the contract period is first determined by comparing the value of work carried out in the contract period for the project h with the value of work carried out by the contractor as a whole for the contract period.

It does not provide that BSCL would be bound or have the same benefits against MII in the same way. Therefore by reason of Article 3.1 of the sub-contract the main contract between ONGC and BSCL would apply to the relevant sub-contract work and MII was enjoined with a duty towards BSCL to fulfil its obligations and responsibilities. But, thereby, BSCL cannot absolve itself from its liability so far as breach of the terms and conditions of the sub-contract is concerned. By reason of Article 3.1, the contract by and between ONGC and BSCL has not been subsumed in the sub-contract so as to absolve BSCL from its own contractual liability for breach of contract or otherwise. (Para 122) In terms of clause 37 of the main contract between ONGC and BSCL [set out in para 116 herein] neither of the parties are liable to the other for any consequential damages. The claim for damages raised by MII cannot be said to be consequential damages. The claim relates to direct losses purported to have been occasioned by the failure to perform the contractual duty on the part of BSCL and to honour the time-bound commitments. Such a loss, according to MII, occurred on account of increased overhead cost and decreased profit and additional management costs by reason of BSCL's delays and disruptions. It is only in that view of the matter that the Emden Formula was taken recourse to. Furthermore, clause 37 of the main contract was a matter of an agreement by and between ONGC and BSCL.

The matter was referred to EIL. Use of material was found to be technically acceptable to EIL to which ONGC agreed. ONGC, however, made it clear that it would not make payment for the substituted material. BSCL immediately by a telex informed the same to g MII. Clause 5 of the contract categorically states that MII was to procure the material which was to be reimbursed by BSCL. The extra amount incurred by MII for procuring materials having extra thickness, therefore, was not payable. To the aforementioned extent, there has been a novation of contract. MII had never asserted, despite the forwarding of the contention of ONGC, that it would not comply therewith. It, thus, accepted in sub silentio. It, thus, must be held to h have accepted that no extra amount shall be payable.

LTD. 191 The involvement of ONGC was necessary and if it is the accepted case of the parties that ONGC would not entertain any claim of BSCL in this behalf, a fortiori having regard to the tripartite agreement, the arbitrator could have no jurisdiction to determine the claim in favour of MII only because at one point of time BSCL had raised its own claim with ONGC. Any reduction of the claim of BSCL by ONGC had a direct nexus with the claim of MII. It was, therefore, not a case where ONGC was not involved in the matter. The exchange of letters categorically proves that MII had accepted that it would not be entitled to any extra amount in that behalf. MII by necessary implication accepted the said contention. The principle of acceptance sub silentio shall also be attracted in the instant case. MII was, therefore, not entitled to raise a claim to the extent of fabrication on account of the increased charges for substitution of material.

(Para 141) The arbitrator held that MII would be entitled to receive the entire amount as BSCL, despite receipt of payment from ONGC, did not pay the amount to MII. For the purpose of applicability of the exchange rates, the same is irrelevant. The award was required to be made in terms of the contract whereby and whereunder the foreign exchange rate was frozen as was applicable on 9-8-1984. The parties were bound by the said terms of contract. It may be noticed that the sub-contract was entered into on 1-1-1986. The execution of the contract had started much earlier i.e. much before the date of entering into the contract. The purpose for which the rupee-US dollar conversion rate has been frozen as on 9-8-1984 must be viewed from the angle that thereby the parties thought that loss or gain towards the exchange rates would be on account of MII. (Para 143) There might be some delay on the part of BSCL to make payments but to hold that the exchange rate clause shall cease to have any application only because of the breaches on the part of BSCL, cannot be accepted. It cannot be accepted that the exchange variation provision does not relate to the payments in respect of Claims 1, 2 and 3. The objection raised by BSCL to the said extent is accepted.

With a view to achieve exploration of production programme, ONGC appointed contractors to fulfil substantial portions of its offshore construction requirements. Burn Standard Company Limited (for short \"BSCL\") was interested in the second stage of platform construction of ONGC i.e. structural and progress fabrication and material procurement. Four contracts were thereafter awarded in favour of BSCL for fabrication, d transportation and installation of six platforms bearing Nos. ED, EE, WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 and associated pipelines. They were to be installed in ONGC's Bombay High Sea. e f g h Contract 2. The said contracts covered: (i) Material procurement and fabrication of the ED and EE jackets, piles and decks. (ii) Transportation and installation of the ED and EE jackets, piles and decks. (iii) Material procurement and fabrication of the WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 jackets, piles, temporary decks and main decks (the \"Four Platform Fabrication Main Contract\"), and (iv) Transportation and installation of the WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 jackets, piles, temporary decks and decks, and installation of four pipelines and eight risers (the \"Four Platform Installation Main Contract\"). The said contracts contained arbitration agreements. 3. BSCL and McDermott International Inc. (for short \"MII\") entered into technical collaboration agreement on 25-9-1984 in terms whereof the latter agreed to transfer technology to the former with regard to design, construction and operation of a fabrication yard. The said agreement contains a separate arbitration clause between the parties. 4.

MII has also claimed interest on these two amounts from 29-2-1992 till payment. This claim for interest has not been dealt with in the award and has been omitted from the award.

MII's claim for a declaration that BSCL is liable to the tax authorities for all further liabilities for Indian corporate income tax as may be assessed in future in respect of income received by MII under the d sub-contract is allowed only insofar as it related to MII's liability, if any, to corporate income tax, on the amounts awarded to it by a partial award, an additional award and a final award. 3.

Point 8 related to change orders and extra work. The learned arbitrator awarded MII US$ 305,840.00 as regards Change Order 1. As regards Change Order 6, MII was awarded US$ 72,000.00 against BSCL. Furthermore, in respect of Change Order 9, MII was awarded US$ 300,000.00 against BSCL. As regards extra work, MII was awarded US$ 4,870,290.96 against BSCL pursuant to the invoices covered under the said point whereas MII's claim for US$ 637,473.00 was rejected. 25. Point 9 related to delays and disruptions. MII was awarded US$ 574,000.00 against BSCL in respect of Change Order 2. MII was further awarded US$ 1,271,820.00 and US$ 355,000.00 against BSCL under Change Orders 3 and 7 respectively. As regards increased cost and expenditure incurred by MII, it was awarded US$ 8,973,031.00. 26. So far as the claim of interest is concerned, the learned arbitrator made the following order: \"MII is entitled to interest on the amounts awarded under various heads by final award. In my opinion, having regard to the circumstances of the case, a rate of interest at 10 per cent per annum will be appropriate from the date on which the amount fell due for payment to the date of this final award. The awarded amount including interest shall bear the interest at the same rate from the date of this final award to the date of the payment by BSCL.\" The learned arbitrator also awarded US$ 750,000.00 as costs of the arbitration. 27. An application was filed by BSCL under Section 34 of the Act praying for setting aside the final award. Submissions 28. Mr Jayanto Mitra, learned Senior Counsel and Mr Pallav Sisodia, learned counsel appearing on behalf of BSCL made the following submissions: (i) The arbitrator had no jurisdiction to make a partial award which is not postulated under the 1996 Act as an award in piecemeal is impermissible in law. (ii) While making the partial award, the learned arbitrator opined that involvement of ONGC was imperative for determination of Points 6, 8 and 9 i.e. claims relating to transportation of pipes, change orders and extra work and delays and disruptions and, thus, the final award must be held to be bad in law. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(iv) Although US$ 8.8 million has been awarded as regards alleged delay and disruption of work, no reason, far less any cogent or sufficient reason, as was mandatorily required in terms of Section 31 of the Act having been assigned, the impugned award is vitiated in law. (v) In its award, the learned arbitrator was bound to determine the b actual loss suffered by the parties and as the same was not determined, the award cannot be enforced. (vi) The award as regards loss of profit under various heads is based on no evidence and, thus, wholly unreasonable. (vii) The claims made by MII were not only contrary to the terms of c contract but also substantive law of India and were otherwise opposed to public policy. (viii) As the contract did not contain any agreed schedule or any stipulation as to whether the work was required to be finished within a stipulated period, in view of the fact that the contention of MII was that the time was of the essence of contract, the only remedy available to it in d terms of Section 55 of the Indian Contract Act was to revoke the contract upon giving a notice therefor. In the absence of such a notice, damages could not be claimed. Reliance in this behalf has been placed on Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India 1• (ix) No amount towards extra work was payable to MII having regard to the payment clauses contained in the contract and in particular the e minutes of the meeting held by the parties on 9-8-1984.

(xi) The learned arbitrator having rejected the claim of MII in his partial award dated 9-6-2003 on the ground that increased overhead f decrease of profit and additional management cost had not been raised before reference to arbitration and, thus, was beyond the scope of arbitral reference, could not have determined the selfsame question in his final award. The objection and the award for US$ 8.8 million had not been taken into consideration and, thus, the same is liable to be set aside.

(xiii) So far as the claim of extra work is concerned, the learned arbitrator has wrongly allowed the claim of MII in respect of Invoices Nos. 2806470 to 2806475 although due date for payment of the said amount fell after the commencement of reference to arbitration and, thus, as no dues existed on that date, the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to make an award in relation thereto. (xiv) As regards \"exchange loss\", Mil's claim was allowed without any amendment to the statement of claim. Claim of MII was wrongly allowed by the learned arbitrator for entire value of the invoices without any deduction as delay in making payment by BSCL to MII on account of delay in receiving payment from ONGC has no relevance and in any event was contrary to the terms of the contract. The learned arbitrator had also not taken into consideration that in terms of the contract, foreign exchange rate was frozen at the rate of Rs 100 = 8.575 dollars as was applicable on 9-8-1984. (xv) The claim for US$ 2.3 million was outside the scope of reference to arbitration as no demand there for was made. Such a claim was made for the first time only in the statement of claim. (xvi) In terms of clause 37 of the contract entered into by and between ONGC and BSCL, no award by way of damages was payable. Similar provision was also contained in the sub-contract entered into by and between the parties. (xvii) As MII was to compensate for the supply of materials by BSCL subsequently, no award for a sum of US$ 2.3 million could be made. (xviii) As no invoice in respect of the claim of US$ 28,400 on account of an additional barge trip to transport the ED temporary deck had been raised, the learned arbitrator had no jurisdiction to decide the same. (xix) The award under the said head for a sum of US$ 54,000 on account of additional survey of WI-S and WI-9 pipelines was not an arbitrable dispute being clearly outside the purview of the arbitration proceedings. (xx) Relying on or on the basis of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) Code as a base for measurement being contrary to the contract, the award is liable to be set aside.

(b) Tie-down and sea-fastening a As tie-down materials are required for safe transportation of structures allotted on transportation barge, the learned arbitrator erred in allowing the claim of MII as they are not permanent part of jacket decks of any platform. ( c) Substitution of materials The learned arbitrator committed a serious error in not taking into account the material evidence adduced by BSCL to the effect that MII was instructed to substitute the specified materials with available material at no additional cost of fabrication. b 29. That in terms of the contract, it was for MII to procure the materials which were to be reimbursed by BSCL. The claim for US$ 20,832.108 was c based on fabrication charges on account of increased tonnage for material substitution for WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 jackets and piles as well as ED and EE jackets and, thus, as the learned arbitrator had allowed claim only to the extent of fabrication, the amount claimed by MII could not have been allowed in toto. 30. Mr Dipankar Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of d MII, on the other hand, submitted that no case has been made out for setting aside the award of the learned arbitrator. In reply to the submissions made on behalf of BSCL, it was urged as below: Re: Increased overhead decrease of profit and additional management cost 31. The amount has been awarded on the basis of statement of Mr D.J. e Parson. The contract clearly provided that WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 platforms were to be completed by 30-12-1985 whereas ED and EE platforms were to be commissioned in February 1986. It is not the case of MII that the time was of the essence of contract and, thus, in terms of Section 55 of the Indian Contract Act, damages were payable. Even in terms of the f main contract between BSCL and ONGC, time was not of the essence of the contract. The contract contained clauses for extension of time and liquidated damages which are also indicative of the fact that time was not of the essence of the contract and, thus, damages for delay are permissible in law in view of the decision of this Court in Hind Construction Contractors v. State of M aharashtra2 . 32. Change Orders 2, 3 and 7 covered compensation under various heads g as specified therein. The award of the learned arbitrator clearly shows that additional costs had been incurred by MII and, thus, the award cannot be faulted. The partial award did not deal with the said claims. The dispute was specifically referred to arbitration in terms of the notice dated 10-4-1998.

(Sinha,].) 205 been made out for interference with the award particularly in view of the fact that BSCL had never raised any objection as regards the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. 33. Reliance on the Emden Formula cannot be said to be against the law prevailing in India as Sections 55 and 73 of the Indian Contract Act provided only for entitlement to compensation and not the mode and manner in which such compensation is to be quantified. 34. Clause 37 of the main contract between ONGC and BSCL has no application as MII's claim is not for any consequential damage but for the direct losses occasioned by BSCL's breach of contractual duty to honour its time-bound commitments. The said clause cannot be extended to the obligations towards MII under the sub-contract as ONGC has no role to play in respect of the breach of its obligations towards it by BSCL under the sub-contract. Re: Partial award 35. A partial award is in effect and substance an interim award within the meaning of Sections 31(6) and 2(c) of the Act and, thus, the validity of the partial award is not open to question. Re: Exchange loss 36. Clause 4.0 of the contract only relates to payment for transportation and installation and BSCL did not make any payment to MII despite receipt of the whole amount from ONGC except an amount of Rs 12,70,290. In any event, clause 4.0 has no relevance to the exchange loss dispute. BSCL acted contrary to the agreed terms as it made payment upon applying the fixed exchange rate of Rs 100 = US$ 8.575. BSCL was to pay to MII the amount as per the current rate, only on reconciliation; MII was to refund the excess amount to BSCL which ensured that exchange loss would be shared by both the parties. Re: Uninvoiced claims 37. BSCL never raised any objection before the arbitrator that the claim for US$ 2,300,200 for procurement of structural material could not be raised in view of the provisions contained in Section 16 of the 1996 Act. Invoice in any event, is merely a basis for claim and such a claim may be raised in correspondences as also in the meetings. The claim for US$ 2,300,200 was not strictly claim for damages, as in terms of the contract BSCL was required to procure the steel and as it being not in a position to do so, MII agreed to procure the same on its behalf if BSCL would agree to pay US$ 2,300,200 to cover MII's cost for accelerated procurement and other costs. This offer was the subject-matter of correspondence between the parties. As no dispute was raised to recover the same amount from BSCL, procurement job was undertaken. The finding arrived at by the learned arbitrator in this behalf is entirely a finding of fact. Reference to clause 5 of the contract was wholly irrelevant.

The claim was towards labour charges for fabrication of structures, labour charges and b not claim for cost of material. AISC Code applied in relation to the fabrication job is as under: \"The scheme of the contract provided in relation to fabrication and the application of AISC Code is explained below: (i) the sub-contract provides total estimated tonnage of 18, 178 ST with the following break-up: ED?EE platforms 6078 ST (p. 166, IA No. 2 Vol. 2) WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 platforms 12,100 ST/18, 178 ST (p. 371, IA No. 2 Vol. 2)\" Re: Buoyancy tanks for ED and EE jackets C 39. Mil's claim is for labour cost at the rate of US$ 1067 per ST involved d for fabrication work in the refurbishment of the buoyancy tanks. The finding of the arbitrator is a finding of fact inter alia based on the admission of the witness, namely, Shri S.K. Mukherjee, who was examined on behalf of BSCL. Re: Tie-down and sea-fastening 40. In offshore construction, jackets and decks are fabricated onshore and then they are transported on barges to the offshore location for installation. Jobs pertaining to tie-down and sea-fastening required substantial fabrication work and no claim has been made towards costs of welding the tie-downs and sea-fasteners to the deck. e 41. Clause 2 of the contract would have no application to the instant case f as it provides only for a stage payment on milestone basis. But, clause 2.l(a)(i) which substantially covers sea-fastening job as part of the fabrication contract would be applicable.

The payment of extra work became due when the work was performed and moreover, the invoices in question did not specify any date for payment. Re: Interest 44. The ground has been taken only in the supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of BSCL on 21-9-2004 beyond a period of three months as specified in Section 34 of the Act. The arbitrator has awarded the principal amount and interest thereon up to the date of award and future interest thereupon which do not amount to award of interest on interest as interest awarded on the principal amount up to the date of award became the principal amount which is permissible in law. Challenge to award: Legal scope of 45. Section 2(l)(b) of the 1996 Act reads as under: \"2. (l)(b) 'arbitration agreement' means an agreement referred to in Section 7;\" 46. In terms of the 1996 Act, a departure was made so far as the jurisdiction of the court to set aside an arbitral award is concerned vis-a-vis the earlier Act. Whereas under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act, the power of the court was wide, Section 34 of the 1996 Act brings about certain changes envisaged thereunder. 47. Section 30 of the 1940 Act reads, thus: \"30. Grounds for setting aside award.-An award shall not be set aside except on one or more of the following grounds, namely- (a) that an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself or the proceedings; (b) that an award has been made after the issue of an order by the court superseding the arbitration or after arbitration proceedings have become invalid under Section 35; (c) that an award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid.\" 48. The section did not contain the expression \"error of law .... \". The same was added by judicial interpretation. While interpreting Section 30 of the 1940 Act, a question has been raised before the courts as to whether the principle of law applied by the arbitrator was (a) erroneous or otherwise, or (b) wrong principle was applied. If, however, no dispute existed as on the date of invocation, the question could not have been gone into by the arbitrator. Changes under the new Act 49. The 1996 Act makes a radical departure from the 1940 Act. It has embodied the relevant rules of the modern law but does not contain all the ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 208 SUPREME COURT CASES (2006) 11 sec provisions thereof. The 1996 Act, however, is not as extensive as the English Arbitration Act. 50. Different statutes operated in the field in respect of a domestic award a and a foreign award prior to coming into force of the 1996 Act, namely, the 1940 Act, the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937 and the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961. All the aforementioned statutes have been repealed by the 1996 Act and make provisions in two different parts, namely, matters relating to domestic award and foreign award respectively. b Vis-a-vis grounds for setting aside the award 51. After the 1996 Act came into force, under Section 16 of the Act the party questioning the jurisdiction of the arbitrator has an obligation to raise the said question before the arbitrator. Such a question of jurisdiction could be raised if it is beyond the scope of his authority. It was required to be raised during arbitration proceedings or soon after initiation thereof. The c jurisdictional question is required to be determined as a preliminary ground. A decision taken thereupon by the arbitrator would be the subject-matter of challenge under Section 34 of the Act. In the event the arbitrator opined that he had no jurisdiction in relation thereto an appeal thereagainst was provided for under Section 37 of the Act. 52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for d the review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this e can be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered by it. 53. However, this Court, as would be noticed hereinafter, has had the occasion to consider the matter in great detail in some of its decisions. 54. In Prime trade AG v. Ythan Ltd. 3 jurisdictional issue based on f interpretation of documents executed by the parties fell for consideration having regard to the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1992. It was held that as the appellant therein did not become holder of the bills of lading and alternatively as the conditions laid down in Section 2(2) were not fulfilled, the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to arbitrate in the disputes and differences between the parties. g Vis-a-vis the duty to assign reasons 55. Another important change which has been made by reason of the provisions of the 1996 Act is that unlike the 1940 Act, the arbitrator is required to assign reasons in support of the award. A question may invariably arise as to what would be meant by a reasoned award. 3 (2006) 1 All ER 367 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In Bachawat's Law of Arbitration and Conciliation, 4th Edn., pp. 855-56, it is stated: \" ... 'Reason' is a ground or motive for a belief or a course of action, a statement in justification or explanation of belief or action. It is in this sense that the award must state reasons for the amount awarded. The rationale of the requirement of reasons is that reasons assure that the arbitrator has not acted capriciously. Reasons reveal the grounds on which the arbitrator reached the conclusion which adversely affects the interests of a party. The contractual stipulation of reasons means, as held in Poyser and Mills' Arbitration. In re, 'proper, adequate reasons'. Such reasons shall not only be intelligible but shall be a reason connected with the case which the court can see is proper. Contradictory reasons are equal to lack of reasons. The meaning of the word 'reason' was explained by the Kerala High Court in the contest of a reasoned award .... 'Reasons are the links between the materials on which certain conclusions are based and the actual conclusions ... .' A mere statement of reasons does not satisfy the requirements of Section 31(3). Reasons must be based upon the materials submitted before the Arbitral Tribunal. The Tribunal has to give its reasons on consideration of the relevant materials while the irrelevant material may be ignored .... Statement of reasons is a mandatory requirement unless dispensed with by the parties or by a statutory provision.\" 57. In Konkan Rly. Corpn. Ltd. v. Mehul Construction Co. 4 this Court emphasised the mandatoriness of giving reasons unless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise. Public policy 58. In Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. 5 this Court laid down that the arbitral award can be set aside if it is contrary to (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; (b) the interests of India; or (c) justice or morality. A narrower meaning to the expression \"public policy\" was given therein by confining judicial review of the arbitral award only on the aforementioned three grounds. An apparent shift can, however, be noticed from the decision of this Court in ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. 6 (for short \"ONGC\"). This Court therein referred to an earlier decision of this Court in Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly7 wherein the applicability of the expression \"public policy\" on the touchstone of Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act and Article 14 of the Constitution of India came to be considered.

In ONGC6 this Court, apart from the three grounds stated in Renusagar5 , added another ground thereto for exercise of the court's jurisdiction in setting aside the award if it is patently arbitrary. 59. Such patent illegality, however, must go to the root of the matter. The public policy violation, indisputably, should be so unfair and unreasonable as b to shock the conscience of the court. Where the arbitrator, however, has gone contrary to or beyond the expressed law of the contract or granted relief in the matter not in dispute would come within the purview of Section 34 of the Act. However, we would consider the applicability of the aforementioned principles while noticing the merits of the matter. 60. What would constitute public policy is a matter dependant upon the c nature of transaction and nature of statute. For the said purpose, the pleadings of the parties and the materials brought on record would be relevant to enable the court to judge what is in public good or public interest, and what would otherwise be injurious to the public good at the relevant point, as contradistinguished from the policy of a particular Government. (See State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata 8 .) d 61. In ONGC6 this Court observed: (SCC pp. 727-28, para 31) \"31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase 'public policy of India' used in Section 34 in context is required to be given a wider meaning. It can be stated that the concept of public policy connotes some matter which concerns public good and the public interest. What is for public good or e in public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or public interest has varied from time to time. However, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public interest. Such award/judgment/decision is likely to adversely affect the administration of justice. Hence, in our view in addition to narrower meaning given to the term 'public policy' in f Renusagar case5 it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it is patently illegal. The result would be-award could be set aside if it is contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (b) the interest oflndia; or (c) justice or morality; or g (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal. Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that award is against the public policy. Award 6 ONGC Ltd. v.

We are not unmindful that the decision of this Court in ONGC6 had invited considerable adverse comments but the correctness or otherwise of the said decision is not in question before us. It is only for a larger Bench to consider the correctness or otherwise of the said decision. The said decision is binding on us. The said decision has been followed in a large number of cases. (See The Law and Practice of Arbitration and Conciliation by O.P. Malhotra, 2nd Edn., p. 1174.) 63. Before us, the correctness or otherwise of the aforesaid decision of this Court is not in question. The learned counsel for both the parties ref erred to the said decision in extenso. 64. We, therefore, would proceed on the basis that ONGC6 lays down the correct principles of law. Supervisory jurisdiction 65. We may consider the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties on the basis of the broad principles which may be attracted in the instant case i.e. (i) whether the award is contrary to the terms of the contract and, therefore, no arbitrable dispute arose between the parties; (ii) whether the award is in any way violative of the public policy; (iii) whether the award is contrary to the substantive law in India viz. Sections 55 and 73 of the Indian Contract Act; (iv) whether the reasons are vitiated by perversity in evidence in contract; (v) whether adjudication of a claim has been made in respect whereof there was no dispute or difference; or (vi) whether the award is vitiated by internal contradictions. 66. For the aforementioned purpose, it would be necessary to see as to what law the arbitrator was required to apply. 67. We may, therefore, consider the legal submissions before adverting to the merits of the matter. Validity of the \"partial award\" 68. The 1996 Act does not use the expression \"partial award\". It uses interim award or final award. An award has been defined under Section 2(c) to include an interim award. Sub-section (6) of Section 31 contemplates an interim award. An interim award in terms of the said provision is not one in respect of which a final award can be made, but it may be a final award on the matters covered thereby, but made at an interim stage. 69. The learned arbitrator evolved the aforementioned procedure so as to enable the parties to address themselves as regards certain disputes at the first instance. As would appear from the partial award of the learned arbitrator, he deferred some claims. He further expressed his hope and trust that in relation to some claims, the parties would arrive at some sort of settlement having 6 ONGC Ltd. v.

While in relation to some of the claims, a finality was attached to the award, certain claims were deferred so as to enable the learned arbitrator to advert a thereto at a later stage. If the partial award answers the definition of the award, as envisaged under Section 2(c) of the 1996 Act, for all intent and purport, it would be a final award. In fact, the validity of the said award had also been questioned by BSCL by filing an objection in relation thereto. 70. We cannot also lose sight of the fact that BSCL did not raise any objection before the arbitrator in relation to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. b A ground to that effect has also not been taken in its application under Section 34 of the Act. We, however, even otherwise do not agree with the contention of Mr Mitra that a partial award is akin to a preliminary decree. On the other hand, we are of the opinion that it is final in all respects with regard to disputes referred to the arbitrator which are subject-matters of such C award. We may add that some arbitrators instead and in place of using the expression \"interim award\" use the expression \"partial award\". By reason thereof the nature and character of an award is not changed. As, for example, we may notice that in arbitral proceedings conducted under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, the expression \"partial award\" is generally used by the arbitrators in place of interim award. d In any view of the matter, BSCL is not in any way prejudiced. We may state that both the partial award and the final award are subject-matter of challenge under Section 34 of the Act. 71. Section 33 of the Act empowers the Arbitral Tribunal to make correction of errors in arbitral award, to give interpretation of a specific point or a part of the arbitral award, and to make an additional award as to claims, e though presented in the arbitral proceedings, but omitted from the arbitral award. Sub-section ( 4) empowers the Arbitral Tribunal to make additional arbitral award in respect of claims already presented to the Tribunal in the arbitral proceedings but omitted by the Arbitral Tribunal provided: 1. there is no contrary agreement between the parties to the reference; f 2. a party to the reference, with notice to the other party to the reference, requests the Arbitral Tribunal to make the additional award; 3. such request is made within thirty days from the receipt of the arbitral award; 4. the Arbitral Tribunal considers the request so made justified; and 5. additional arbitral award is made within sixty days from the receipt of such request by the Arbitral Tribunal. The additional award, in our opinion, is not vitiated in law. Delay and disruption g Operative facts h 72.

A stipulation for commissioning of ED and EE platforms within a time-frame has also been mentioned i.e. February 1986 as would appear from the following: \"1. The agreement for commissioning of Platforms ED and EE is, by the end of February 1986, subject to the provisions of this contract.\" 74. MII served a notice on 10-4-1998 invoking the arbitration agreement. The same would not mean that it should have repudiated the contract as soon as 20 months' schedule fixed by the contract expired. Delay and disruptions might have occurred for various reasons. In the instant case, therefore, the matter would be covered by the second part of Section 55 of the Indian Contract Act providing that where the parties did not intend time to be of the essence of the contract, the contract was not voidable, but the promisee was entitled to compensation for loss occasioned. For the aforementioned purpose, no notice was required to be served. In any event, the contract provided for extension of time, as would appear from clause 27(ii) and the relevant portions of clause 28 which read as under: \"27.

Change Order 2 relates to additional cost incurred by McDermott due to delay in receipt of equipment and material supplied by BSCL. BSCL's delivery of the equipment was up to seventeen months late. During this period, McDermott continued to fabricate the decks installing material as it became available. The delay resulted in additional costs to McDermott due to change order with cost effect of US$ 574,000.00. BSCL has failed and neglected to make payment of the invoice for this change order. 4.66. Change Order 3 relates to mobilisation and demobilisation of Derrick Barge 26 to complete BSCL work in the 1986/1987 construction season. The sub-contract price was based on mobilisation and demobilisation of a single barge in the 1984/1985 and 1985/1986 construction seasons only and performance of the offshore scope of work in a continuous sequence. Due to BSCL delays, WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 decks and helidecks were not completed for installation during the 1985/1986 work season. Further, WI-7 to WI-8 pipeline and five risers could not be installed due to unavailability of material and lack of access to the EB and EC jackets, which were still under construction. In the 1986/1987 construction season, McDermott used Derrick Barge 27, which was already in the field, to install WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 decks. McDermott also had to mobilise Derrick Barge 26 in the same construction season for installation of WI-7 to WI-8 pipeline and associated risers. On the instructions of BSCL, McDermott mobilised Derrick Barge 26 in February 1987. Derrick Barge 26 installed the pipelines and risers and was demobilised from the field on 10-3-1987. For the mobilisation/demobilisation of Derrick Barge 26 for the 1986/1987 construction season work, McDermott submitted a change order to BSCL with cost effect of US$ 1,271,820.00. BSCL has failed and neglected to make payment of the invoices for this change order. 4.67. Change Order 7 relates to offshore installation or late-supplied equipment on WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 decks. As early as February 1986, the parties contemplated that certain BSCL-supplied equipment planned for installation by McDermott onshore would have to be installed offshore due to the projected late delivery. The cost of installing equipment offshore is as much as US$ 1,140,705.00. On 6-11-1986, McDermott reviewed the list of outstanding equipment and revised its change order to US$ 355,000.00. On the instructions of BSCL, McDermott performed the change order work and installed outstanding equipment offshore. BSCL has failed and neglected to make payment of the invoice for this change order.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In the final award also the learned arbitrator noticed: \"The discussion covering earlier issues establishes that BSCL was guilty of delays and disruptions. Proceeding from there, the question is a whether MII is entitled to an amount on account of increased overhead and loss of profit and additional project management costs? MII states that construction law recognises that construction contractor incurs two general jobs of costs in the course of its operation; the operating costs that are attributable to a particular project, and costs such as overhead that are expended for the performance of the business as a whole, b including the particular project. Consequently, construction law recognises that owner-caused delay entitles the contractor to recover from the owner the increased overhead and loss of profit as part of damages. Reference has been made to Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, Article 8.176-91, pp. 1074-81 (11th Edn.), Molly J.B., 'A formula for Success'. Three formulae have been evolved for c computation of a claim for increased overhead and loss of profit due to prolongation of the works: the Hudson Formula, the Emden Formula and Eichleay Formula. Of these three, the Emden Formula is the one widely applied and which has received judicial support in a number of cases.\" Section 55 of the Indian Contract Act d 83. Section 55 of the Indian Contract Act reads as under: \"55. When a party to a contract promises to do a certain thing at or before a specified time, or certain things at or before specified times, and fails to do any such thing at or before the specified time, the contract, or so much of it as has not been performed, becomes voidable at the option of the promisee, if the intention of the parties was that time should be of the essence of the contract. e If it was not the intention of the parties that time should be of the essence of the contract, the contract does not become voidable by the failure to do such thing at or before the specified time; but the promisee is entitled to compensation from the promisor for any loss occasioned to him by such failure. If, in case of a contract voidable on account of the promisor's failure to f perform his promise at the time agreed, the promisee accepts performance of such promise at any time other than that agreed, the promisee cannot claim compensation for any loss occasioned by the non-performance of the promise at the time agreed, unless, at the time of such acceptance, he gives notice to the promisor of his intention to do so.\" 84. In Arosan Enterprises Ltd. 1 the law was stated in the following terms: g (SCC pp. 461-62, para 13) \"13. These presumptions of the High Court in our view are wholly unwarranted in the contextual facts for the reasons detailed below but before so doing it is to be noted that in the event the time is the essence of the contract, question of there being any presumption or presumed extension or presumed acceptance of a renewed date would not arise.

In the event the parties knowingly give a go-by to the stipulation as regards the time-the same may have two several effects: (a) parties name a future specific date for delivery, and (b) parties may also agree to the abandonment of the contract-as regards (a) above, there must be a specific date within which delivery has to be effected and in the event there is no such specific date available in the course of conduct of the parties, then and in that event, the courts are not left with any other conclusion but a finding that the parties themselves by their conduct have given a go-by to the original term of the contract as regards the time being the essence of the contract. Be it recorded that in the event the contract comes within the ambit of Section 55, Contract Act, the remedy is also provided therein.\" It was further observed: (SCC pp. 465-66, para 19) \"19. Turning now on to the issue of duty to speak, can it be said that silence on the part of the buyer in not replying to the letters dated 15-11-1989, 20-11-1989, 24-11-1989, 4-12-1989 and 20-12-1989 only shows that the buyer was not willing to extend the delivery period after 15-11-1989-the answer cannot but be in the negative, more so by reason of the fact that fixation of a second delivery date by the Appellate Bench of the High Court as noticed above, cannot be termed to be in accordance with the law. There was, in fact, a duty to speak and failure to speak would forfeit all the rights of the buyer in terms of the agreement. Failure to speak would not, as a matter of fact , jeopardise the seller's interest neither would the same authorise the buyer to cancel the contract when there have been repeated requests for acting in terms of the agreement between the parties by the seller to that effect more so by reason of a definite anxiety expressed by the buyer as evidenced in the intimation dated 8-11-1989 and as found by the arbitrator as also by the learned Single Judge.\" We, therefore, are of the opinion that in the instant case the second part of Section 55 of the Indian Contract Act would be attracted and not the first part. Whether time was of the essence of the contract 85. The question which further arises for consideration is as to whether the respondents having proceeded on the basis that time was of the essence of the contract, it was bound to issue a notice of repudiating the contract subject to reservation as regards its claim of damages. MII, however, states that it had never raised a contention that the time was of the essence of the contract, but the claim arises in view of the delay caused in completion of the contract for a period of 34 months and consequent escalation of costs. The price payable in terms of the sub-contract did not adequately cover increased costs expended by MII. On a plain reading of the provisions of Section 55 of the Indian Contract Act, it is evident that as the parties did not intend that time was to be of the essence of the contract on the expiry whereof the contract ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

We may notice that BSCL had never pleaded before the arbitrator that a the time was of the essence of the contract. In construction contracts generally time is not of the essence of the contract unless special features exist therefor. No such special features, in the instant case, have been brought to our notice. 87. The learned arbitrator proceeded on the basis that BSCL had accepted and acknowledged that no additional cost on account of delay was b occasioned in completing the helidecks. MII is found to have incurred additional cost for offshore installation. The learned arbitrator has also found that MII had not received any payment on account of such increased cost. The compensation under the said head of claim was only in addition to Change Orders 2, 3 and 7 to which we shall advert to a little later. 88. This Court in Hind Construction v. State of Maharashtra2 stated: c (SCC pp. 76-77, paras 7 & 8) \"7. . . . that question whether or not time was of the essence of the contract would essentially be a question of the intention of the parties to be gathered from the terms of the contract .... (See Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 4, para 1179). 8 . ... even where the parties have expressly provided that time is of d the essence of the contract such a stipulation will have to be read along with other provisions of the contract and such other provisions may, on construction of the contract, exclude the inference that the completion of the work by a particular date was intended to be fundamental; . . .

The principal question which arises for consideration is whether uninvoiced claims could be a subject-matter of dispute. While dealing with the claims falling within the purview of the partial award, the arbitrator noticed: f \"23.

( Sinha, J.) 219 It was further noticed: \"Reference has been made to the claim in respect of the standby of MII transportation spread, additional compensation on account of the construction of temporary emergency helidecks, the extended stay of MII personnel and a claim in respect of Lay Barge 26. All these claims will be considered after it has been satisfactorily proved that invoices in respect of each of these claims were issued and had become due for payment before the reference to arbitration was made and also meanwhile the arbitration record will have received the statement of ONGC/BSCL in respect of Change Order Proposals 2, 3, 7 and 8. Therefore, the consideration of these claims is deferred.\" 90. No invoice was raised by MII for the following claims: (i) Claim of US$ 2,300,200 for procurement of structural material on BSCL's behalf. (ii) US$ 28,400 for additional barge trip. (iii) US$ 54,000 for additional pipeline survey. 91. The said claims are the subject-matter of the partial award. It was dealt with by the learned arbitrator in the following terms: \"It was pointed out by BSCL that ONGC did not accept the reconciliation attempted by MII in regard to the pipelines. I have examined the documents pertinent to this question, and I find that the variation is so marginal that it can reasonably be ignored. It seems to me that to take account of those variations is to attempt to make too fine a point. I would accept the reconciliation statement and proceed on that basis. BSCL contends that the claim made by MII on account of the additional survey of WI-8, WI-9 pipelines is not acceptable because it is covered within the lump sum price mentioned in the sub-contract. I am not impressed by that submission because had it been so covered ONGC would not have undertaken to conduct the additional survey itself. It was treated as something outside the subject-matter covered by the lump sum price and when ONGC requested BSCL to conduct the additional survey, and at the behest of BSCL the additional survey was conducted by MII, there is good reason for MII to claim the payment of US$ 54,000 for that survey.\" 92. While dealing with the claims for the standby of DB 26 and interruption in WI-9 to WI-S pipeline laying, the arbitrator in his partial award held: \"22. Standby Derrick Barge 26 (US$ 1,396,800.00).-The claim for payment of standby charges in respect of Derrick Barge 26 relates to a standby for 24 days of that vessel. The MII statement of claim mentions that MII has not sent any invoice to BSCL. Therefore it cannot be said that any claim has been made by MII yet in the matter. Consequently, the position is that no difference or dispute concerning this had arisen between the parties when the reference to arbitration was made. Therefore, so far as this arbitration is concerned, the claim cannot be entertained. It falls outside this arbitration and cannot be considered. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Admittedly, they had not yet been invoiced when the reference to arbitration was made. It is not clear what are the specific claims included within that sum. If they had not been invoiced, it cannot be said that they remained unpaid, and that therefore a difference or dispute had arisen between the parties when the reference to arbitration was made.\" The said claims were, thus, rejected only on the ground that no invoice had b been raised and consequently no difference or dispute had arisen by and between the parties at the time when the reference to arbitration was made. 93. Mr Mitra contended that applying the same line of reasoning, the learned arbitrator should have rejected the aforementioned claims. However, we may notice that the said claim as regards procurement of structural material related to damages. According to MII, the said claim strictly did not c relate to damages (sic a claim) under the contract. BSCL was required to procure the steel and as it was not in a position to do so, MII had agreed to procure steel on its behalf, provided it agreed to cover MII's cost for accelerated procurement, material priced premiums, order fixing costs and other incidental charges. It is not in dispute that such a claim was the subject- matter of correspondence which passed between the parties. Receipt of such d letters from MII is not denied or disputed by BSCL. It has also not been disputed that the right reserved by MII to claim such additional costs towards procurement of the materials on behalf of BSCL was not denied or disputed. Only pursuant to or in furtherance of the said correspondence, had procurement on the said basis been undertaken by MII and acceptance of BSCL in this behalf was presumed. The learned arbitrator proceeded on such e presumption. According to the learned arbitrator, despite such knowledge, BSCL failed to make payment. The learned arbitrator in his award has gone into the said question in detail. Reference had been made to the evidence of Shri A.R. Taylor, who was examined on behalf of MII. The said witness was cross-examined by BSCL. Both the parties had filed detailed written submissions before the learned arbitrator. It is on the basis of such evidence f brought on record and submissions made before him, the learned arbitrator held: \"... In my opinion, BSCL must be taken to have accepted the proposal of MII and to have gone along with MII's action flowing from that proposal and to have benefited thereby.\" 94. With a view to consider the submission of Mr Mitra that in terms of g the contract entered into by and between the parties, MII was not entitled to the said claim, it would be proper to notice the relevant clause of the contract which is in the following terms: \"5.

Replacement material shall be delivered by BSCL to MII's yard at Dubai Emirate, United Arab Emirates or to Singapore Port Authority for trans-shipment by MII (at BSCL's cost) to Batam Island, Indonesia. MII shall indicate the destination when furnishing the replacement steel request.\" 95. In terms of the aforementioned provision of the contract, BSCL was required to procure suitable steel for jackets on replacement basis in regard to the quantum of steel purchased by MII. If BSCL had failed to procure the said required amount of steel to replace the structural materials which MII had provided from its inventory as an accommodation to BSCL, indisputably the understanding between the parties was that either such materials should be replaced or the cost therefor had to be paid. It has not been disputed before the arbitrator that BSCL (sic did not) promptly replaced the material. It is in that view of the matter, the learned arbitrator in his partial award held: \"15.19. The procurement was effected by MII from its inventory on the basis that it would be replaced by BSCL promptly. It was not so replaced. To effect the replacement MII would be compelled to pass through the entire burdensome process of procuring the structural material directly from outside sources. MII suffered loss and damage which it has quantified at US$ 2.3 million in the light of the considerations mentioned by it earlier.\" 96. The arbitrator has noticed that the claim of MII arose only after it has been satisfactorily proved that the invoices in respect of each of these claims were issued and had become due for payment before reference to the arbitrator. It furthermore appears that para 23 of the partial award and the claim for compensation on the aforementioned head are not identical. Para 23 of the partial award dealt with the claim in respect of WI-9 to WI-S pipeline laying. So far as para 24 of the said award is concerned, the learned arbitrator noticed the specific invoices issued against Change Orders 2, 3 and 7 relating to delay and disruptions. It is, therefore, in our considered opinion, not correct to contend that the invoice is the only base whereby and whereunder a claim can be made. There is no legal warrant for the said proposition. A claim can also be made through correspondence or in meetings. 97. A claim for overhead costs resulting in decrease in profit or additional management costs is a claim for damages. 98. An invoice is drawn only in respect of a claim made in terms of the contract. For raising a claim based on breach of contract, no invoice is required to be drawn. 99. It is furthermore not in dispute that the claim for damages had been made prior to invocation of arbitration. Once such a claim was made prior to invocation, it became a dispute within the meaning of the provisions of the 1996 Act. It is not disputed that the same claim was specifically referred to arbitration by MII in terms of its notice dated 10-4-1989. 100. While claiming damages, the amount therefor was not required to be quantified. Quantification of a claim is merely a matter of proof. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Such an objection was required to be raised by BSCL before the arbitrator in terms of Section 16 of the 1996 a Act. It may also be of some interest to note that this Court even prior to the enactment of a provision like Section 16 of the 1996 Act in Waverly Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. Raymon & Co. (India) (P) Ltd. 12, Dharma Prathishthanam v. Madhok Construction (P) Ltd. 13 clearly held that it is open to the parties to enlarge the scope of reference by inclusion of fresh disputes and they must be held to have done so when they filed their statements putting forward claims b not covered by the original reference. Method for computation of damages 102*. What should, however, be the method of computation of damages is a question which now arises for consideration. Before we advert to the rival contentions of the parties in this behalf, we may notice that in M.N. Gangappa v. Atmakur Nagabhushanam Setty & Co. 14 this Court held that the c method used for computation of damages will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 102-A. In the assessment of damages, the court must consider only strict legal obligations, and not the expectations, however reasonable, of one contractor that the other will do something that he has assumed no legal obligation to do. (See Lavarack v. Woods of Colchester Ltd. 15, All ER p. 690 d G.) 103. The arbitrator quantified the claim by taking recourse to the Emden Formula. The learned arbitrator also referred to other formulae, but, as noticed hereinbefore, opined that the Emden Formula is a widely accepted one. e 104. It is not in dispute that MII had examined one Mr D.J. Parson to prove the said claim. The said witness calculated the increased overheads and loss of profit on the basis of the formula laid down in a manual published by the Mechanical Contractors Association of America entitled \"Change Orders, Overtime, Productivity\" commonly known as the Emden Formula. The said formula is said to be widely accepted in construction contracts for computing f increased overheads and loss of profit. Mr D.J. Parson is said to have brought out the additional project management cost at US$ 1,109,500. We may at this juncture notice the different formulas applicable in this behalf. (a) Hudson Formula: In Hudson 's Building and Engineering Contracts, Hudson Formula is stated in the following terms: \"Contract head office x Contract sum x Period of overhead and profit Contract period delay\" percentage 12 (1963) 3 SCR 209 : AIR 1963 SC 90 13 (2005) 9 sec 686 g * Ed.: Para 102 con-ected vide Official Con-igendum No. F.3/Ed.B.J./52/2006 dated 31-7-2006 h 14 (1973) 3 sec 406 15 (1967) 1 QB 278 : (1966) 3 All ER 683 : (1966) 3 WLR 706 (CA) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

(Sinha, J.) 223 In the Hudson Formula, the head office overhead percentage is taken from the contract. Although the Hudson Formula has received judicial support in many cases, it has been criticised principally because it adopts the head office overhead percentage from the contract as the factor for calculating the costs, and this may bear little or no relation to the actual head office costs of the contractor. (b) Emden Formula: In Emden 's Building Contracts and Practice, the Emden Formula is stated in the following terms: \"Head office overhead x Contract sum and profit x Period of delay\" 100 Contract period Using the Emden Formula, the head office overhead percentage is arrived at by dividing the total overhead cost and profit of the contractor's organisation as a whole by the total turnover. This formula has the advantage of using the contractor's actual head office overhead and profit percentage rather than those contained in the contract. This formula has been widely applied and has received judicial support in a number of cases including Norwest Holst Construction Ltd. v. Coop. Wholesale Society Ltd. 16 , Beechwood Development Co. (Scotland) Ltd. v. Mitchell 17 and Harvey Shopfitters Ltd. v. Adi Ltd. 18 . (c) Eichleay Formula: The Eichleay Formula was evolved in America and derives its name from a case heard by the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, Eichleay Corporation. It is applied in the following manner: Step 1 Contract billings Total billings for contract period Step 2 Allocable overhead Total days of contract Step 3 x Total overhead for contract period Daily contract overhead rate x Number of days of delay Overhead allocable to the contract Daily overhead rate Amount of unabsorbed overhead\" This formula is used where it is not possible to prove loss of opportunity and the claim is based on actual cost.

Before us several American decisions have been referred to by Mr Dipankar Gupta in aid of his submission that the Emden Formula has since been widely accepted by the American courts being Nicon Inc. v. United States 19, Gladwynne Construction Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore20 and Charles G. William Construction Inc. v. White21 . 106. We do not intend to delve deep into the matter as it is an accepted position that different formulae can be applied in different circumstances and the question as to whether damages should be computed by taking recourse to one or the other formula, having regard to the facts and circumstances of a particular case, would eminently fall within the domain of the arbitrator. C 107. If the learned arbitrator, therefore, applied the Emden Formula in d assessing the amount of damages, he cannot be said to have committed an error warranting interference by this Court. Actual loss: Determination of 108. A contention had been raised both before the learned arbitrator as also before us that MII could not prove the actual loss suffered by it as is required under the Indian law viz. Sections 55 and 73 of the Indian Contract e Act as Mr D.J. Parson had no personal knowledge in regard to the quantum of actual loss suffered by MII. D.J. Parson indisputably at one point of time or the other was associated with MII. He applied the Emden Formula while calculating the amount of damages having regard to the books of accounts and other documents maintained by MII. The learned arbitrator did insist that sufferance of actual damages must be proved by bringing on record books of f accounts and other relevant documents. 109. Sections 55 and 73 of the Indian Contract Act do not lay down the mode and manner as to how and in what manner the computation of damages or compensation has to be made. There is nothing in Indian law to show that any of the formulae adopted in other countries is prohibited in law or the same would be inconsistent with the law prevailing in India. g 110. As computation depends on circumstances and methods to compute damages, how the quantum thereof should be determined is a matter which would fall for the decision of the arbitrator. We, however, see no reason to interfere with that part of the award in view of the fact that the 19 Decided on 10-6-2003 (USCA Fed Cir), 331 F. 3d 878 (Fed.

In State of U.P. v. Allied Constructions22 this Court held: (SCC p. 398, para 4) \"4. Any award made by an arbitrator can be set aside only if one or the other term specified in Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 is attracted. It is not a case where it can be said that the arbitrator has misconducted the proceedings. It was within his jurisdiction to interpret clause 47 of the agreement having regard to the fact-situation obtaining therein. It is submitted that an award made by an arbitrator may be wrong either on law or on fact and error of law on the face of it could not nullify an award. The award is a speaking one. The arbitrator has assigned sufficient and cogent reasons in support thereof. Interpretation of a contract, it is trite, is a matter for the arbitrator to determine (see Sudarsan Trading Co. v. Govt. of Kerala23 ). Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 providing for setting aside an award is restrictive in its operation. Unless one or the other condition contained in Section 30 is satisfied, an award cannot be set aside. The arbitrator is a Judge chosen by the parties and his decision is final. The court is precluded from reappraising the evidence. Even in a case where the award contains reasons, the interference therewith would still be not available within the jurisdiction of the court unless, of course, the reasons are totally perverse or the judgment is based on a wrong proposition of law. An error apparent on the face of the records would not imply closer scrutiny of the merits of documents and materials on record. Once it is found that the view of the arbitrator is a plausible one, the court will refrain itself from interfering (see U.P. SEB v. Searsole Chemicals Ltd. 24 and /spat Engg. & Foundry Works v. Steel Authority of India Ltd. 25).\" 112. It is trite that the terms of the contract can be express or implied. The conduct of the parties would also be a relevant factor in the matter of construction of a contract. The construction of the contract agreement is within the jurisdiction of the arbitrators having regard to the wide nature, scope and ambit of the arbitration agreement and they cannot be said to have misdirected themselves in passing the award by taking into consideration the conduct of the parties. It is also trite that correspondences exchanged by the parties are required to be taken into consideration for the purpose of construction of a contract. Interpretation of a contract is a matter for the arbitrator to determine, even if it gives rise to determination of a question of law. (See Pure Helium India (P) Ltd. v. ONGC26 and D.D. Sharma v.

The above principles have been reiterated in Chairman and MD, NTPC Ltd. v. Reshmi Constructions, Builders & Contractors28 , Union of India v. Banwari Lal & Sons (P) Ltd. 29 , Continental Construction Ltd. v. State of U.P. 30 and State of U.P. v. Allied Constructions22 . 115. A court of law or an arbitrator may insist on some proof of actual damages, and may not allow the parties to take recourse to one formula or the b other. In a given case, the court of law or an arbitrator may even prefer one formula as against another. But, only because the learned arbitrator in the facts and circumstances of the case has allowed MII to prove its claim relying on or on the basis of Emden Formula, the same by itself, in our opinion, would not lead to the conclusion that it was in breach of Section 55 or Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act. c Clause 37-Effect of 116. We may now look at clause 37 of the main contract entered into by and between ONGC and BSCL which reads as under: \"37. Indirect and consequential damages.-Neither company nor contractor shall be liable to the other for any consequential damages, d which shall include but not be limited to loss of revenue/profits, loss or escape of product, etc.\" 117. In Major (Retd.) Inder Singh Rekhi v. Delhi Development Authority31 , whereupon Mr Mitra placed strong reliance, an award made under the old Act was in issue. A dispute had arisen whether there was a claim and denial or repudiation thereof. In that context, it was held: (SCC e p. 340, para 4) \"There should be dispute and there can only be a dispute when a claim is asserted by one party and denied by the other on whatever grounds. Mere failure or inaction to pay does not lead to the inference of the existence of dispute. Dispute entails a positive element and assertion of denying, not merely inaction to accede to a claim or a request. f Whether in a particular case a dispute has arisen or not has to be found out from the facts and circumstances of the case.\" 118. There is no dispute about the aforementioned principle but the same would not mean that in every case the claim must be followed by a denial. If a matter is ref erred to any arbitrator within a reasonable time, the party invoking the arbitration clause may proceed on the basis that the other party g to the contract has denied or disputed his claim or is not otherwise interested in ref erring the dispute to the arbitrator. 28 (2004) 2 sec 663 29 (2004) s sec 304 30 (2003) 8 sec 4 22 (2003) 7 sec 396 31 (1988) 2 sec 338 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ahuja32 this Court opined: (SCC p. 118, para 24) \"24. Here when claim for escalation of wage bills and price for materials compensation has been paid and compensation for delay in the payment of the amount payable under the contract or for other extra works is to be paid with interest thereon, it is rather difficult for us to accept the proposition that in addition 15 % of the total profit should be computed under the heading 'Loss or Profit'. It is not unusual for the contractors to claim loss of profit arising out of diminution in turnover on account of delay in the matter of completion of the work. What he should establish in such a situation is that had he received the amount due under the contract, he could have utilised the same for some other business in which he could have earned profit. Unless such a plea is raised and established, claim for loss of profits could not have been granted. In this case, no such material is available on record. In the absence of any evidence, the arbitrator could not have awarded the same. This aspect was very well settled in Sunley (B) & Co. Ltd. v. Cunard White Star Ltd. 33 by the Court of Appeal in England. Therefore, we have no hesitation in deleting a sum of Rs 6,00,000 awarded to the claimant.\" We are herein not concerned with such a case. 120. In terms of clause 3 7 of the main contract, reference whereto has been made hereinbefore, neither of the parties are liable to the other for any consequential damages. The claim for damages raised by MII cannot be said to be consequential damages. The claim relates to direct losses purported to have been occasioned by the failure to perform the contractual duty on the part of BSCL and to honour the time-bound commitments. Such a loss, according to MII, occurred on account of increased overhead cost and decreased profit and additional management costs by reason of BSCL's delays and disruptions. It is only in that view of the matter, that the Emden Formula was taken recourse to. Furthermore, clause 37 of the main contract was a matter of an agreement by and between ONGC and BSCL. In law, it could not have been extended to the obligations assumed by BSCL towards MII in terms of the contract entered into by and between the said parties. So far as ONGC is concerned, it cannot be said to have any role to play in the event of breach of obligation on the part of BSCL towards its sub-contractor. 121. Article 3.1 of the sub-contract reads as under: \"MII shall be bound to BSCL by the terms of this sub-contract agreement and to the extent that the provisions of the respective main contract between the buyer and BSCL apply to the relevant sub-contract work of MII as defined in this sub-contract agreement, MII shall assume towards BSCL all the obligations and responsibilities which BSCL, by such main contract, assumes to the buyer and shall have the benefit of all 32 c2004) s sec 109 33 (1940) 1 KB 740: (1940) 2AUER 97 (CA) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

By reason of the said provision, therefore, the main contract between ONGC and BSCL would apply to the relevant sub-contract work and MII was enjoined with a duty towards BSCL to fulfil its obligations and b responsibilities. But, thereby, BSCL cannot absolve itself from its liability so far as breach of the terms and conditions of the sub-contract is concerned. In other words, by reason of Article 3.1, the contract by and between ONGC and BSCL has not been subsumed in the sub-contract so as to absolve BSCL from its own contractual liability for breach of contract or otherwise. Method of measurement 123. The main contention of BSCL in this behalf is that the learned arbitrator acted illegally and without jurisdiction in adopting the AISC Code. The question arose in the context of the provisions in the contract that MII was required to undertake to fabricate the materials which were required to C be supplied and, therefore, was entitled to fabrication charges from BSCL. It d has not been denied or disputed before us that the parties did not agree to a fixed method of measurement. They did not ref er to the AISC Code in the contract but only because the AISC Code was not referred to in the contract, the same by itself may not be a ground for us to hold that the arbitrator had gone beyond the terms of the contract. Clauses 23.1.l(a) and (c) of the main contract read as under: e \"23 .1.1. (a) Payment for structural material viz. steel and steel tubulars, anodes, flooding and grouting stems, rubberised rings and rubberised items for barge bumpers, rub-strips and boat landing shall be made on the basis of actual landed cost at contractor's yard.

Submission of Mr Mitra is that a combined reading of the aforementioned provisions would go to show that the method of measurement was the subject-matter of the contract. We do not agree. Clause 23 .1.1 has no application in the present case as it covers payment for structural material which has no nexus with Claim 4 (sic Claim 1 ). The claim of MII was for labour charges due under the sub-contract for fabricating the structures. 125. The learned arbitrator, in his partial award, while dealing with the said claim held: \"J 5. 7. As regards replacement steel, BSCL would procure suitable steel for jackets (based on MTO supplied by MII), on a replacement basis for MII purchased steel. BSCL would purchase steel as plate suitable for rolling 24 in OD and tubulars. Replacement material would be delivered by BSCL to MII's yard at Dubai, UAE or to Singapore Port Authority for trans-shipment by MII, at BSCL's cost, to Batam Island, Indonesia. In the matter of computing the prices payable for structural fabrication of piles, jackets and decks clause 23 .1.1 of the main fabrication contract provided that the prices would be computed as follows: The payment for structural material, namely, steel and steel tubulars and anodes, flooding and grouting system, rubberised rings and rubberised items for barge bumpers, rub-strips and boat landing would be made on the basis of actual landed cost at the yard of BSCL or MII. The landed cost would include CIF price, testing charges, if any, plus port charges, clearing and handling charges at port, transportation to BSCL's or Mil's fabrication yard plus local taxes, and ONGC would pay to BSCL an additional 7½ per cent of the landed cost to cover the cost of procurement.\" 126. Wastage allowance was relevant only for the purpose of allowance due to BSCL from MII in respect of scrap materials. The learned arbitrator in his award had referred to evidence adduced in this behalf by Shri A.R. Taylor.

The scheme of the contract provides that total estimated tonnage of 18,178 ST will have the following break-ups: a ED/EE platforms 6078 ST WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 -12,100 ST platforms 18,178 ST 128. Since the total tonnage of 18,178 ST was only an estimated tonnage, the sub-contract made provision for variation of the contract price on the b basis of \"as-fabricated\" tonnage. Further the quantities of the materials used were to be jointly determined by ONGC/EIL, BSCL and MII on the basis of fabricated tonnage which was to be used for adjusting the sub-contract price. If the \"as-fabricated tonnage\" was found to be less than the estimated tonnage, the excess payment received by MII through monthly bills was to be refunded. If the \"as-fabricated tonnage\" was found to be more than the c estimated tonnage, MII was to be paid for the additional tonnage by applying the rate of US$ 1067 per ST. The contract was silent with respect to the method or code to be applied for determining the \"as-fabricated tonnage\". 129. Clause 1. 1. 13 defined specifications to mean Industry Standard Codes (ISC). In the absence of a contractually specified method of calculation, MII applied the AISC manual of steel construction for d calculating the as-fabricated tonnage. AISC is an industry standard. It has been applied by ONGC in other contracts. Even the arbitrator has noted that BSCL has also accepted the validity of the AISC Code. Now BSCL cannot turn around and take a contrary position before this Court in the proceedings under Section 34 of the Act. Hence by adopting the AISC Code, the arbitrator has not acted contrary to the terms of the contract. e 130. The arbitrator in his award noticed that the parties impliedly accepted the validity of the AISC method of calculation for calculating the final fabricated weight in the following terms: \".. . Instances of those contracts have been provided by MII during the arbitration proceeding showing that the AISC Code has been employed for determining the final 'as-fabricated tonnage' of f structures ... It seems to me that inasmuch as BSCL has applied the AISC Code in the case of long-to-long point distance measurement it cannot be denied that the AISC Code is regarded as a valid basis for measurement. There is no reason why it should be applied in the case of one category of fabrication and not in the case of another.\" If before the arbitrator, the said mode of calculation was accepted, we do not g see any reason why BSCL should be permitted to raise the said question before us.

The claim of MII was that it had nothing to do with the cost of material or the nature of the fabrication work involved. Its claim was purely based on the labour cost at the rate of US$ 1067 per ST which was incurred by it towards fabrication work in the refurbishment of the buoyancy tanks. According to it, the tonnage of the buoyancy tanks had not been taken into account by ONGC on the ground that no fabrication work was done after removal of the buoyancy tanks from N-3 and WI-8 jackets. The learned arbitrator, however, in his partial award found as of fact that substantial fabrication work had been done by MII in the refurbishment of the said buoyancy tanks in the following terms: \"12.22... Accepting those instructions, MII made substantial fabrication in refurbishing, handling, rigging and welding the buoyancy tanks on the ED and EE jackets. The oral evidence of RW 1 S.K. Mukherjee shows that the attachment of buoyancy tanks involves substantial fabrication activity. There can be no doubt that fabrication work had to be done and that involved a measure of labour activity. MII has demonstrated that there was difference in weight between the original buoyancy tanks used on N-3 and WI-8 jackets and the weight of those tanks when used on the ED and EE jackets. It says that this clearly points to substantial fabrication activity for refurbishment of those two tanks.\" 132. It has further been held by the learned arbitrator that MII had also been able to establish that there had been a difference in weight between the original buoyancy tanks used on N-3 and WI-8 jackets and the weight of those tanks when used in ED and EE jackets. In fact, the learned arbitrator in arriving at the said conclusion had taken into consideration the admission of Shri S.K. Mukherjee who was examined on behalf of BSCL itself that attachment of buoyancy tanks involved substantial fabrication activity. The dispute raised is a matter of appreciation of evidence. The findings arrived at by the learned arbitrator cannot, thus, be said to be perverse. Tie-downs and sea-fastening 133. This claim relates to the question whether MII was entitled to payment for fabrication as the tie-downs and sea-fastening require substantial fabrication job in regard whereof there did not exist any provision in the contract. The learned arbitrator has accepted the claim of MII holding that offshore construction contracts, jackets and decks are fabricated onshore and then they are transported on barges to the offshore location for installation wherefor the lugs, braces and other sea-fastening and tie-down items are required to be created which the installation contractor is to use to weld the jackets and decks to the transportation barges, thereby securing the jackets for their journey to the offshore location. MII had merely claimed payment for fabrication of tie-downs and sea-fastening as part of the fabrication scope of work. Reference has been made to clause 2 of the contract which is as under: \"2.1. (i)(a) Load-out, sea-fastening, ... 60% of the transportation and installation lump sum price of jacket, piles and appurtenances. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The said provision has no application in the instant case as it merely a provides for stage payment on milestone basis. In fact, the clause which would be attracted in the present case contained in clause 2.l(a)(i) is as under: \"The scope of work to be executed by contractor under this contract shall comprise ... (i) Jackets b Including barge bumpers, boat landing, grouting and flooding systems, launch trustees, riser clamps. Catholic protection anodes, and mats and other accessories and components indicated in the drawings and specifications including lifting lugs, pulling lugs, retaining lugs, etc. for lead out and refastening and upending of the jacket.\" c 135. It specifically covers sea-fastening as part of the scope of fabrication contract work. WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 fabrication contract also contains a similar clause in clause 2 .1. 136. The learned arbitrator in para 12.24 of his award noticed that BSCL itself has acknowledged to ONGC that the tie-down materials had been fabricated as part of the fabrication scope and the weight could not be d disallowed in calculating the \"as-fabricated tonnage\". It, therefore, evidently cannot take a stand which is contrary thereto and inconsistent therewith. Thus, by reason of the award, the learned arbitrator was of the opinion that the sea-fastening and tie-down were part of the transportation and installation scope and BSCL did not succeed in proving that the said item should be included in the scope of transportation and is not a separate item under the e head of fabrication. Again, the findings of the learned arbitrator were within his domain, being findings of fact. Foreign exchange 137. Dispute in relation to the said claim would depend upon the interpretation of clause 3 of Section 2 of the Consolidated Sub-Contract Price Schedule which provides: f \"While the sub-contract price for the work described in the letter of intent is payable by BSCL to MII in US dollars the main contract price is payable by ONGC to BSCL in Indian rupees.

(Sinha, J.) 233 less than the rupee equivalent of the sub-contract price as determined on the basis of the aforesaid rate prevailing on 9-8-1984, BSCL shall remit the balance amount of Indian rupees, if any, to MII in US dollars at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date of such US dollar remittance; and if after such reconciliation it is found that BSCL has expended rupees in excess of the rupees equivalent of the sub-contract price for the work described in the letter of intent, MII shall arrange to refund any such excess in rupees to BSCL.\" Clause 4.0 of the contract provides that the payment will be made by BSCL to MII on receipt of payment by BSCL from ONGC. 138. It is not in dispute that by reason of the contract entered into by and between the parties the rate was frozen at Rs 100 = US$ 8.575. One of the questions which arises for consideration is as to whether the said provision applied to all the claims or not. According to MII, having regard to the provisions for milestone payments for transportation and installation, clause 4.0 would apply only in relation thereto. 139. It is contended that BSCL had not correctly understood the merit and purport of the said provision which has been sought to be explained. The said provision according to MII would be as under: If the contract is followed, MII gets US$ 100 and pays back US$ 7.43, therefore, the net receipt of MII is US$ 92.57. However, BSCL had adjusted the exchange rate at the time of payment only. The rate as per contract is 1 US$ = 11.662. Thus, the rate on the date of payment is Rs 13. Therefore, the net receipt of MII is only US$ 89.70. In reality, the loss suffered by MII was much greater since in the fifty-four month life of the project, the value of the Indian rupee deteriorated drastically against the US dollar. 140. It is not in dispute that in terms of the contract, the payments made by BSCL, which was to be in US dollars, was required to be reconciled at the end of the contract. According to MII, if BSCL expended less than the rupee amount stipulated in the sub-contract in dollar payments, BSCL would convert the unused rupees to dollars to remit the dollars to MII. Whereas if BSCL expended more than the agreed amount of rupees, MII would refund the excess amount to BSCL so as to ensure sharing of exchange loss by both the parties. According to MII, however, BSCL acted contrary to the said provision insofar as instead of paying the full amount of invoice in US dollars it paid at the fixed exchange rate relying on, or on the basis of, the aforementioned provisions, resulting in loss suffered by MII. 141. The learned arbitrator proceeded on the basis that loss of exchange provisions had no application in respect of structural material (Claim 4), bulk material (Claim 5), transportation of pipe (Claim 6), reimbursables (Claim 7), change orders and extra work (Claim 8) and delay and disruption (Claim 9).

It is, however, one thing to say that having regard to the nature of breach on the part of BSCL, MII would be entitled to claim damages, but it is a another thing to say that by reason thereof it would be entitled to full payment without deduction relating to BSCL conversion of Indian rupees to US dollars. It is not in dispute that the initial claim of MII was US$ 2,881,195.03 which was later on revised to US$ 3,330,790.94. 142. In terms of the agreement, payments were to be made to MII if the payments were certified by EIL and upon receipt of payments from ONGC b and upon receipt of foreign exchange clearance. For appreciating the aforementioned disputes, it may be necessary to refer to the general terms of payment clause: \"I. Fabrication.-Claims for structural fabrication work are to be billed by MII duly certified by EIL on monthly basis and the payment of the same bills shall be released after 60 days of receipt of the bill by c BSCL. 4. Payments as stipulated above will be subject to the following conditions.-(a) Receipt of foreign exchange clearance by BSCL. (b) Payments on milestone basis will be made by BSCL to MII only after payments have been received by BSCL from ONGC.\" d 143. The learned arbitrator held that MII would be entitled to receive the entire amount as BSCL, despite receipt of payment from ONGC, did not pay the amount to MII. For the purpose of applicability of the exchange rates, the same, in our opinion, is irrelevant. The award was required to be made in terms of the contract whereby and whereunder the foreign exchange rate was frozen as was applicable on 9-8-1984. The parties were bound by the said e terms of contract. It may be noticed that the sub-contract was entered into on 1-1-1986. The execution of the contract had started much earlier i.e. much before the date of entering into the contract. The purpose for which the rupee-US dollar conversion rate has been frozen as on 9-8-1984 must be viewed from the angle that thereby the parties thought that loss or gain towards the exchange rates would be on account of MII. It is in the f aforementioned situation that a letter of intent in the following terms was served: \"M/s McDermott International Inc., P.O. Box 3098, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

We shall however inform you as soon as the c Government's approval/clearance is received by us. Subject to this, we would request you to proceed with the work to ensure completion within the agreed schedule.\" 144. There might be some delay on the part of BSCL to make payments. We may not go into the aforementioned question, but to hold that the exchange rate clause shall cease to have any application only because of the d breaches on the part of BSCL, cannot be accepted. 145. We are not in a position to accept that the exchange variation provision does not relate to the payments in respect of Claims 1, 2 and 3. The objection raised by the claimant to the said extent is accepted. Substitution 146. It is not in dispute that MII had substituted heavier material, as e material conforming to ONGC specification was not available readily in the market. The matter was referred to EIL. Use of material was found to be technically acceptable to EIL to which ONGC agreed by a letter dated 3-5-1985. ONGC, however, made it clear that it would not make payment for the substituted material. BSCL immediately by a telex dated 13-5-1985 f informed the same to MII. ONGC also in its letter dated 6-12-1984 categorically stated: \"The subject-matter highlighted in your letter mentioned above has been reviewed by us and we have found that payment against increased tonnage on account of material substitutions proposed by M/s BSCL/MII cannot be agreed to. Based on the above we reiterate our view that we g will pay the material/fabrication costs based on the materials shown in the AFC drawings.\" 147. The claim of MII is based on the failure on the part of BSCL to fulfil its part of the obligation in procurement of the required material. It is true that BSCL agreed to reimburse MII for the same. MII's claim is partially based on the facts that EIL had recommended payments therefor as stated in h a letter to ONGC dated 10-2-1987 and 6-4-1987. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

However, it is also not in dispute that ONGC did not accept the said recommendations and refused to take into consideration the substituted tonnage for payment of \"as-fabricated tonnage\". 149. There may be a dispute in this behalf between BSCL and ONGC. However, admittedly, ONGC refused payment to BSCL. 150. In his partial award, the learned arbitrator noticed that ONGC's involvement was imperative. ONGC had all along maintained its stand that it was not ready and willing to bear the extra costs. The correspondence between the parties was brought on record. 151. Clause 5 of the contract categorically states that MII was to procure the material which was to be reimbursed by BSCL. The extra amount incurred by MII for procuring materials having extra thickness, therefore, was not payable. To the aforementioned extent, there has been a novation of contract. MII had never asserted, despite forwarding of the contention of ONGC, that it would not comply therewith. It, thus, accepted in sub silentio. It, thus, must be held to have accepted that no extra amount shall be payable. It is one thing to say that some more amount might have been spent towards fabrication but the learned arbitrator has awarded the exact amount claimed by MII in the following terms: \"I am satisfied that MII is entitled to a payment of US$ 20,832.108 for the disallowed tonnage of 19.584 ST at the contractual rate of US$ 1067 per ST.\" 152. It is in the aforementioned context that the involvement of ONGC was necessary and if it is the accepted case of the parties that ONGC would not entertain any claim of BSCL in this behalf, a fortiori having regard to the tripartite agreement, the learned arbitrator could have no jurisdiction to determine the claim in favour of MII only because at one point of time BSCL had raised its own claim with ONGC. In other words, any reduction of the claim of BSCL by ONGC had a direct nexus with the claim of MII. It was, therefore, not a case where ONGC was not involved in the matter. The exchange of letters categorically proves that MII had accepted that it would not be entitled to any extra amount in that behalf. MII by necessary implication accepted the said contention. The principle of acceptance sub silentio shall also be attracted in the instant case. MII was, therefore, not entitled to raise a claim to the extent of fabrication on account of the increased charges for substitution of material used for WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 jackets and piles. 153. To the aforementioned extent, the claim of MII was beyond the terms of the contract. Interest 154. The power of the arbitrator to award interest for pre-award period, interest pendente lite and interest post-award period is not in dispute. Section 31(7)(a) provides that the Arbitral Tribunal may award interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which award is made i.e. pre-award period.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 238 SUPREME COURT CASES (2006) 11 sec subject to the agreement as regards the rate of interest on unpaid sums between the parties. The question as to whether interest would be paid on the whole or part of the amount or whether it should be awarded in the pre-award a period would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The Arbitral Tribunal in this behalf will have to exercise its discretion as regards (i) at what rate interest should be awarded; (ii) whether interest should be awarded on the whole or part of the award money; and (iii) whether interest should be awarded for the whole or any part of the pre-award period. 155. The 1996 Act provides for award of 18 % interest. The arbitrator in b his wisdom has granted 10% interest both for the principal amount as also for the interim. By reason of the award, interest was awarded on the principal amount. An interest thereon was up to the date of award as also the future interest at the rate of 18% per annum. 156. However, in some cases, this Court has resorted to exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 142 in order to do complete justice between the c parties. 157. In Pure Helium India (P) Ltd. 26 this Court upheld the arbitration award for payment of money with interest at the rate of 18% p.a. by the respondent to the appellant. However, having regard to the long lapse of time, if award is satisfied in entirety, the respondent would have to pay a huge amount by way of interest. With a view to do complete justice to the parties, d in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, it was directed that the award shall carry interest at the rate of 6% p.a. instead and in place of 18% p.a. 158. Similarly in Mukand Ltd. v. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. 34, while this Court confirmed the decision of the Division Bench upholding the modified award made by the learned Single Judge, the Court reduced the e interest awarded by the learned Single Judge subsequent to the decree from 11 % per annum to 71/2 % per annum observing that 7½ % per annum would be the reasonable rate of interest that could be directed to be paid by the appellant to the respondent for the period subsequent to the decree. 159. In this case, given the long lapse of time, it will be in furtherance of justice to reduce the rate of interest to 7½ %. f 160. As regards certain other contentions, in view of the fact that the same relate to pure questions of fact and appreciation of evidence, we do not think it necessary to advert to the said contentions in the present case. Conclusion 161. IAs Nos. 2 and 3 are allowed in part and to the extent mentioned hereinbefore. The award of the learned arbitrator is modified to the g aforementioned extent. In the facts and circumstances of this case, there shall be no order as to costs. 26 Pure Helium India (P) Ltd. v.
