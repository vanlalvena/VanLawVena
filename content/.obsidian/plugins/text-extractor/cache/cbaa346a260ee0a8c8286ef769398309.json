MISRA-In thi s case an interesting question of law has been raised by the respondents by an application ( C.M. 508 of 197 3) and it has been contended that the appeal filed by the opposite party and registered as R.F.A. 178 of 1970 be treated as a first appeal from order instead of an appeal from a decree with necessary con- E sequences of dispensing with the printing of the record and its hearing by a Single Judge of the Court. The legal proceedings were initiated by the respond ent Smt. Kaushalya Ram in the Court of the District Judge, Delhi by a petition F under section 272/278 of the Indian Succession Act 39 of 1925 praying for grant of letters of administration with a copy of the will annexed in respect of the estate of the deceased Shri Ram Rakha Mal Nayyar, her father, who died at Delhi on 1st October, 1964 after having executed a will dated 3rd February, 1964 registered on 17~h G H February, 1964. The petition was contested by Shri G. S. Nayyar, appellant, son of the deceased. The petition was tried and the Dis- trict Judge by order dated 14th January, 1970 held that the will in dispute had been duly proved and so he granted to Smt. Kaushalya Rani Jetters of administration with a copy of the will attached. Aggrieved by this order, G. S. Nayyar (contesting respondent in the Court below) filed an appeal in this Court on 15th March, 1970. He described it a Regular First Appeal but paid a fixed court-fees 1 stamp of only Rs . 2.75, presumably under Article 11 of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act . On the raising of an objection by the office the counsel for the petitioner stated that the appeal had properly been classified as R.F.A. and had been filed under section 299 of the Indian Succession Act 39 of 1925 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The matter was consequently placed for admission before a learned Single • ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: ILR (Delhi), © 2023 Delhi High Court.

In accordance with the rules of the Court in regular first appeals, the record has to be printed and it appears that the appellant proceeded with the preparation of the records which was likely to take considerable time. The contesting respondent, time and again, moved applications in this Court for dispensing with the printing of the · record but did not succeed. Eventually the respondent has filed the present application on the contentions tha t the question of the appealability of the order of the Court below and registration of the appeal as R.F.A. or as a first appeal from order be determ ined as preliminary points. The matter 0 came up for hearing .before H. L. Anand, J. who by order dated 26th September, 1973 directed the application to be placed for con- sideration before a Division Bench of the Court. Thus the matter has been placed before us. E T he appellant in the main appeal ( opposite party in the appli- catio n) has opposed the application on various grounds which it is not necessary to state . The questions for co nsideration and determination at this stage are the foilowing : - j C - F 1. Whether the impugned order of the District Judge is a p- G H I pealablc in this Court ? 2. Whether the said appeal is to be registered and treated as a regular first appeal or as a first appeal from order. We have heard the counsel for the parties at some length. The appeal really Jies under section 299 of the Act which r eads as follows:- \"Every order made by a District Judge by virtue of the power hereby conferred upon him shall be subject to appeal to the High C ourt in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 , applicable to appeals .\" ~ection 295 of the Act provides that in any case before the District Judge in which there is a contention, every proceeding shall take, as nearly as may be, the form of a regular suit, according to the pcovi~ions of the Code of Civil Procedure, in which the petitioner for probate or letters of administration, as the cMe may be, shall be the pl~intiff, and the person who has appeared to oppose the ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: ILR (Delhi), © 2023 Delhi High Court.

T he proceedings before the District Judge, however, do not originate by a plaint, but they arc initiated by a petition as provided by section 272 and 278 (or section 276 in other cases) of the Act. Section 272 of the Act provides that probate and letters of administration may be granted upon an appli- B cation for that purpose by a petition verified as provided. Section 278 prescribes the contents of the petition to be filed. Section 277 , 280 and 281 require additional information and make special pro- v1s1ons. Section 283 makes further provisions for the procedure to C D E G I be folfowecJ and section 290 provides that \"where it appears to the District Judge ··· * ··· * that letters or administration to the estate of a person deceased, with or without a copy of the will_ anncJ_cd, should be granted, he shall grant the same under the seal of bis Court in the form set forth in Schedule VII. Schedule VH gives the form of the letters or administration. From a perusal of the above-mcnlione<l provisions of law it would apprc::ar that the Act purports to be R complete Code h:,r ihcll' and makes special provisions ror the matters dealt with by it. Section 295 provides that where there be contentious proceedings, they shall take, a;.; nearly as may be, the form of a regular suit in which the petitione r: would be treated as plaintiff and the opposite party as defendant. Thic; provision only prescribes the rule of procedure as docs section 141 of the Code of Civil Procedure. An interesting ana\\ogy would be found in section 20 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 where a n application ror filing an arbitration agreement and appointment of ~in Arbitrator is directed to be in writing and to be numbered and regis- tered as a suit between one or more of the parties interested a:; plai11tiffs and remainder as clefencJants. These proceedings, hov,·evc r 1 do not result in a decree . T he wo rd 'decree' is defined in sub--clausc (2) of section 2 o ( the Code of' C ivi l Procedure. Clause (14 ) defines \"order\" as forma l expression of any decision of a Civil C ourt which is not a decree . Under section 96 of the Code , an appeal lies from every decree passed by a C ourt exercising original jurisdiction. Appeals from orders arc also p rovided by sectio n 104 and O rder 43 of the Code.

A orders passed by the Court are under section 36 executable in the same manner and according to the same procedure as a decree. This shows that although the rul'es of procedure for appeals from orders arc substantially the same as for appeals from decrees, a marked distinction has been maintained by the Code in respect of orders B and decrees and respective appeals therefrom. C D F G The question for consideration, therefore, is whether the impugned order of the District Judge can be treated as a decree. The definition of the word \"decree\" contained in clause (2 ) of section 2 of the Code is that it means the fo rmal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. By an extended definition, orders under section 47 and section 144 of the Code and an order rejecting a plaint have been included in the dcti nition of decree. However orders of dismissal for default and adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order have been expressly excluded from the purview of decree. It is clear from the definition that the decree finally determines the rights of the parties in a• suit and formal expression of such adjudication is called a decree. The decrees me, therefore, passed, whether preliminary o r final, only in suits. There is no definition of the word suit given in the Code, but section 26 and Order 4, Rule 1 of the Co~¥e a clue that suits arc instituted by ·presentation of a plaint to the C~. T he Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Hansraj vs. Dehi'a Du n-M u~;scor ic Electric Tramway Company Limited. A.f.R. f9~ Privy Council 63 ( 1), observed that a suit was ordinarily instituted by ih c-- r,,·,~scntation of a plain t. The proceedings initiated under the lmt,an Succc:,s ion Act for grant of letters of administration are cJearly not suits. Section 295 of the Succession Act only provides that con- tentious proceedings shall, as nearly as may be, take the form of a regular suit. The statutory provision is a recogJilition of the fact 1hat the proceedings are in reality not a suit but they have been H directed to merely assume the form of a regular suit and that too as nearly as may be. A learned Single Judge of the High Court of Rajasthan in Mt. Bhonri vs. Suwalal, A.I.R . 1956 Rajasthan 119(2), observed that the proceedings under the Indian Succession Act, even I if they became contentious, were not in the form of a regular suit and unless there was a suit as provided by the Code of Civil Procedure, there could not be any decree. The order of the District Judge under appeal has, therefore, not been passed in a suit and so it can ordinarily not be called a decree . 4HCD/74--2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TruePrint™ source: ILR (Delhi), © 2023 Delhi High Court.

D E F The High C ourt of Patna in a Division Bench authority in Antala Gopc vs. Sarbo Gopain, A.I.R. 1962 Patna 489(4) was conside ring the question or the paymL·nt of Court fees on an appeal from a decree for divorce which has been passed under Hindu Marriage Act of 19.\"i.S. A dn:ree or divorce dissolving the marriage had bcc·n p;:sscd uncln »ection 13 of the '.said Act and the provisions for appeal con- tained in section 28 of the said Act were to the effect that all decrees and orders made by a C ourt in any proceedings under the Act would be enforced in the like manner as decrees and orders of the Court made in the exercise of original civil jurisdiction arc enforced and may be appealed from under any Jaw for the time being in force. The contention advanced before the Division Bench was that the :ippeal plainly lay against a dccrc1_' a :1d so the court-fees mus t he payable in accordance with Article I 7 ( vi) of Schedule 11 of the Court Fees Act. /\\fter examining the provisions of Ja.w, the Court observed that section 21 or the Hindu Marriage Act which provided that all proceedings under the Act shall be regulated, as far as may be by G the Code of Civil Procedure, only laid down that the procedure to be at!optcd by the Court would be akin to that provided for the trial or suits in a civil Court, but it did not make th~ proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act a su it, no r the application for divorce H I a plaint. The Division Bench also considered the analogous pro- visions relating to Provincial fnso!vc ncy Act and the Guardian s and Wards Act.

KAUSHALYA RANI 11 A B C D E F G H I AND OTHERS. in a well considered judgment of a Full Bench of the High Court of Allahabad in Panzy Fcrnandas vs. Mrs. M. F. Queros and others, A.f.R. 1963 Allahabad 153(5). There, the question was of court- fees payable on an appeal from an order passed under section 278 of the Succession Act granting letters of administration. Although the Court was concerned with the only question of court-fees, it has made some valuable observations which arc of assistance in the question raised before us. The Full Bench observed that an order on a peti- tion for letters of administration under section 278 of the Succession Act was not a decree as the order had not been passed in a suit and proceedings for lcUers of administration were not commenced by institution of a plaint ; on the other hand section 278 showed that they were commenced by an application or a petition and the deci- sion appealed against was described .in section 299 as an order and not a decree and so the decision of the Court in proceedings of letters of administration could not be described as a decree. A learned Single Judge ol' the High Court of Orissa in Mst. Puin- basi Majhiani vs. Shiba Bhunc A.I.R. 1967 Orissa 41(6), was con- cerned with the question of payment of court-fees on a memorandum of appeal against an order refusing to grant probate of a will under the Indian Succession Act. The Court followed the· Full Bench deci- iion of the High Court of Allahabad referred to above and held that the word ''suif' ordinarily meant and apart from the context must be taken to mean a civil proceeding instituted by a plaint and so in spite of the provisions of section 295 of the Succession Act, the proceedings under the Act could not be taken to mean a suit, nor couJd a decision given in the said proceedings be taken , to be a decree. Accordingly the Court held that an appeal against an order refusing probate was not an appeal from a decree but was only an appeal from an order and was, therefore, liable to payment oE fixed court-fees under Article 11 of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act. The aforesaid authorities support us in the view that the proceed- ings under the Succession Act do. not constitute a suit nor is a deci- sion given in them a decree within the meaning of definition given in the Code. The learned counsel for the appellant, who is the oppo- si.:c party in the application, invited our attention to section 54 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and be relied upon a decision of the High Court of Gujarat in Bai Lalita vs. Shardaben, A.I.R . J 970 Gujarat 37(7). The relevant provisions of the Land Acquisition Act on the subject arc different from the provisions of the Indian Succession Act. Section 26(2) of the Land Acquisition.

Section 54 of the said Act provides that subject to the provisions of the Code applicable to appeals from original decrees and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in B any ena\"..tment for the time being in force, an appeal shall only lie in any proceedings under this Act to the Hjgh Court or from any part of the award, of the Court * * * * The statutory provision, therefore;, by a fiction of the Jaw, has constituted the award C of the District Co~rt given under the Land _Acquisition Act to be a decree and an appeal against the same will, therefore, rightly be classed _as an appeal from a decree. In fact the practice in this Court has been to register appeals from awards as regular first appeals from decrees and the court-fees has been levied ad valorem in accordance D with Article 1 of Schedule I of the Court Fees Act. The reason for this practice is found in the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act which make the award a deemed decree. No irregularity or illegality, therefore, attaches to the said practice. However, under the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, we do not find any E such words which make the decision of the District Judge a decree or an appeal agai~st his decision as an ·appeal from a decree. On the other hand, section 299 itself speaks of ev~ry order of the District Judge and we assume that the Legislature was well aware of the distinctio~ between the expression \"every order\" and \"every decree\" F and it had deliberately used the distinct word \"order\" and not a d~cree in this provision of law. There is, therefore, no justification for construing the expression in section 299 as a decree. passed in a suit. We are, therefore, of the conclusion that the proceedings under the Indian Succession Act do not constitute a suit and the decisions G on the petitions and applications therein are hot included within the definition of decree given in section 2'(2) of the Code either by any express provision or by any necessary intendment: The appeal under section 299 of the Succession Act, therefore, does not lie as H an appeal from a decree under section 96 of the Code. I Under Part 'B' of Chapter 3 of Part V of the Rules and Orders of the High Court, regular first app~als from decrees are placed before a Single Judge for admission and are heard by a Division Bench. On the other hand, first appeals from orders are placed for 1admission before a Division Bench and are eventuaJly heard by a Single Bench.
