(e) - Held, not applicable Allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court Held: The broad proposition that any decree passed in the absence of the defendant, is a decree on merits as it would be the same as if the defendant had appeared and contested the judgment cannot be accepted. (Para 22) b Ram Chand v. John Bartlett, (1909) 3 IC 523, overruled Sir William Rattigan's Private International Law (1895), at pp. 234-35, relied on; Dicey's Conflict of Laws, p. 411, referred to The proposition that the decree was on merits as all documents and particulars had been endorsed with the statement of claim also cannot be accepted. It must not be forgotten that at the stage of issuance of writ of summons the court only forms, if it at all does, a prima facie opinion. Thereafter c the court has to consider the case on merits by looking into the evidence led and documents proved before it, as per its rules. It is only if this is done that the decree can be said to be on merits. (Para 22) Decree would not be on merits if the court has not gone through and considered the case of the plaintiff and taken evidence of the witnesses of the plaintiff. (Para 18) d Middle East Bank Ltd. v. Rajendra Singh Sethia, AIR 1991 Cal 335, explained and approved Gustave Nouvion v.

Sri Ram, AIR 1927 All 510: 25 ALJ 887, overruled by implication In a given case it is possible that even though the defendant has not entered evidence the plaintiff may prove its case through oral and documentary evidence. If after consideration of oral and/or documentary evidence an ex parte decree is passed, it would be a decree on merits. (Para 27) Where, however, no evidence is adduced on the plaintiff's side and his suit e is decreed merely because of the absence of the defendant either by way of penalty or in a formal manner, the judgment may not be one based on the merits f of the case.

Din, AIR 1943 Cal 42: 75 CLJ 271, cited Undoubtedly the burden of proving that the decree is not on merits would be on the party alleging it. However courts never expect impossible proofs. It would never be possible for a party to lead evidence about the state of mind of the Judge who passed the decree. Of course, amongst other things, the party must show that the decree does not show that it is on merits, if necessary the rules of that court, the existence or lack of existence of material before the court when the decree was passed and the manner in which the decree is passed. All this has been done in this case. (Para 23) R.M. V. Vellachi Achi v. R.M.A Ramanathan Chettiar, AIR 1973 Mad 141 : (1972) 2 MLJ 468; R. Viswanathan v. Rukn-ul-Mulk Syed Abdul Wajid, AIR 1963 SC 1 : (1963) 3 SCR 22, referred to There can be no dispute with the proposition that the courts of law are not concerned with the result and even though the result may be repugnant to the court, still the court cannot relieve the party from the burden if the law provides for a contingency. However, this proposition cuts both ways. If the decree is not on merits then, even though the court may be reluctant to leave the respondents remediless, the court would still have to refuse to enforce the decree. (Para 24) Martin Burn Ltd. v. Corpn. of Calcutta, AIR 1966 SC 529; Finn Amar Nath Basheshar Dass v. Tek Chand, (1972) 1 SCC 893 : AIR 1972 SC 1548, referred to In the present case the record of the English court shows that leave to serve the appellant was granted after reading the affidavit. Thus at this stage the court had presumably seen the documents annexed thereto. The court has been careful enough to note that it had read the affidavit. However, at this stage, only a prima facie opinion was being formed. Thereafter the solicitor for the respondent had filed an affidavit of service stating that service had been effected on an employee of the appellant. To this affidavit also all relevant documents were annexed. Thereafter no documents are tendered nor any evidence led. The English court then pronounced the judgment and decree. It did not even say that the second affidavit had been read. This judgment and decree does not indicate whether any documents were looked into and/or whether the merits of the case were at all considered. It merely granted to the respondent a decree for the amounts mentioned therein. To be noted that the appellant had, by his letter dated 8-11-1997, replied to the notice of the respondent dated 18-10-1997. In this reply it had been mentioned that goods were of an inferior quality and not as per the contract. The court has not applied its mind or dealt with this aspect. It has not examined points at controversy between the parties. It has given an ex parte decree as the appellant did not appear at the hearing of the suit. It is not a judgment on merits. Such a decree cannot be enforced in India. (Paras 32 and 33) Section 114 of the Evidence Act merely raises the presumption, under Illustration (e) thereof, that judicial acts have been regularly performed. To say that a decree has been passed regularly is completely different from saying that the decree has been passed on merits. An ex parte decree passed without consideration of merits may be a decree passed regularly if permitted by the rules of that court. Such a decree would be valid in the country in which it is passed unless set aside by a court of appeal. However, even though it may be a valid and enforceable decree in that country, it would not be enforceable in India if it has not been passed on merits.

Even if it were to be presumed that all fonnalities were complied with and the decree was passed regularly it still would not lead to the conclusion that it was passed on merits. (Para 17) a Sk.

Chandra Sekhar, (1985) 1 sec 283 : 1985 sec (Tax) 85 : AIR 1985 SC 114, distinguished The application of the appellant that this decree cannot be enforced in India as it is not on merits is made absolute. (Para 34) D. Civil Procedure Code, 1908 - S. 11 Expln. IV - Constructive res b judicata - Second application filed before decision taken on the first is not barred - Where both applications sought the same relief, but on different grounds (in this case both challenging enforcement of a foreign decree first on ground of non-compliance with Ss. 38, 39 and 40 CPC and second on ground of decree not being on merits as required under S. 13(b) CPC) and ultimately orders were passed after hearing arguments on both c applications, held, no question arose of the second application being barred by principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata Held: Explanation IV to Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure would have come into play only if some decision had been finally given before the second application was filed. In that event it could have been urged that all available d points should have been urged before that decision was given. In this case the second application was filed before any decision on the first application was given. The appellants could have, instead of filing a second application, amended their first application and taken these pleas in that application itself. Had they amended the first application there would have been no bar of res judicata or constructive res judicata. If that be so the contention that the second application was barred by principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata e cannot be accepted. (Para 10) Janki Vallabh v.

The respondent sent a lawyer's notice dated 18-10-1997. The appellant, through his lawyer, sent a reply dated 8-11-1997. a 5. On 19-1-1998 the respondent filed a case in Central London County Court in United Kingdom. The respondent claims that the appellant was served with the summons of that case. The appellant claims that he had not been served in that case. For our purposes we are not concerned with this controversy and express no opinion thereon. b 6. On 20-4-1998, an ex parte decree came to be passed by the Central London County Court. The decree reads as follows: \"IT IS ORDERED THAT: There be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of US $ 49, 178.50 plus interest of US $ 17 .00 ANF court costs. A total of US $ 49,895.50 plus£ 243.75.\" c 7. On 20-8-1998 the respondent filed an execution application in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Ludhiana. Upon receipt of the summons in the execution proceedings the appellant filed an application praying for dismissal of the execution application as it was filed without following the procedure prescribed under Sections 3 8, 39 and 40 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In reply to this application the respondent contended that d the execution was under Section 44-A of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such there was no requirement to observe the provisions of Sections 38, 39 and 40 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In view of this stand the appellants filed another application stating that the decree was not on merits and as per the provisions of Section 44-A read with Section 13(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure the court had to refuse to execute the decree. Both the applications e were heard by the Civil Judge (Junior Division), Ludhiana. By two separate orders dated 15-3-1999, both the applications were dismissed. 8. The appellant then filed Civil Revision No. 2703 of 1999 against two orders dated 15-3-1999. This civil revision came to be dismissed by the impugned judgment dated 9-12-1999. By this judgment the High Court f found that the decree was not on merits but it still dismissed the revision on the ground that the second application was barred by the principles of constructive res judicata. It is against this judgment that these two appeals have been filed. The appellant has filed the appeal [arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 2250 of 2000] against dismissal of their revision. The respondent has filed the appeal [arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 5332 of 2000] against that g portion of the impugned judgment which holds that the decree was not on merits. 9. One further fact which must be mentioned is that the appellant has now filed a suit in Ludhiana against the respondent claiming damages in a sum of Rs 4 lakhs for having supplied goods of an inferior quality and for having committed a breach of the contract. That suit is still pending. h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

The first question for consideration is whether the High Court was right in holding that the second application was barred on principles of constructive res judicata. It must be noted that the first application was on the ground that the provisions of Sections 38, 39 and 40 of the Code of Civil Procedure had not been complied with. In that application the defence taken was that the decree was being executed under the provisions of Section 44-A of the Code of Civil Procedure. In view of this stand, before any decision was given, the second application had been filed. Both the applications were heard together. In other words the second application was filed and heard before any decision was given in the first application. Both the applications were only decided on 15-3-1999. There was thus no question of there being a decision finally deciding a right or claim between the parties. Mr Hingorani however submitted that this case would be covered by Explanation IV to Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He submitted that in the earlier application the defence regarding non-compliance with Section 13(b) could have been taken but had not been taken. He submitted that it was not open to the appellants to take such a defence in a subsequent application. In our view there is no substance in this submission. Explanation IV to Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure would have come into play only if some decision had been finally given before the second application was filed. In that event it could have been urged that all available points should have been urged before that decision was given. In this case the second application was filed before any decision on the first application was given. The appellants could have, instead of filing a second application, amended their first application and taken these pleas in that application itself. Had they amended the first application there would be no bar of res judicata or constructive res judicata. If that be so one fails to understand how the second application was barred by principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata. To be remembered that the orders were passed after hearing arguments on both the applications. Under such circumstances no question arises of there being any res judicata or constructive res judicata. 11. At this stage it must be mentioned that Mr Hingorani relied upon cases of Janki Vallabh v. Moolchand 1, Baijnath Prasad Sah v. Ramphal Sahni2 , P.K. Vijayan v. Kamalakshi Amma3 and Mohanlal Goenka v. Benoy Kishna Mukherjee 4 in support of his submission that the principles of res judicata and/or constructive res judicata also apply to execution proceedings. It is not necessary to deal with these authorities as there can be no dispute to the proposition that principles of res judicata and/or constructive res judicata apply to execution proceedings. However, as stated above, in this case there was no final decision which operated as res judicata. 1 AIR 1974 Raj 168 : 1973 Raj LW 248 2 AIR 1962 Pat 72: 1962 BUR 110 (FB) 3 (1994) 4 sec 53 : AIR 1994 SC 2145 4 AIR 1953 SC 65 : 1953 SCR 377 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Section 44-A of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows: a \"44-A.

Thus under clause (b) if the decree has not been given on the merits of the case then the foreign judgment is not conclusive between the parties and the same cannot be executed in India. 16. The question which then arises is whether the decree, set out hereinabove can be said to be a decree on merits. Parties have cited a large number of authorities of various High Courts on the question as to when a decree can be said to be on merits. 17. In support of the contention that the abovementioned decree is on merits reliance has been placed upon the case of Sk. Abdul Rahim v. Mohd. Din5 • In this case it has been held by the Calcutta High Court that a person asserting that the judgment was not on merits because no evidence was given must prove the same as there is a presumption in Section 114 of the Evidence Act that judicial acts have been regularly performed. On this principle the Calcutta High Court has held that even though a decree was given ex parte the same must be presumed to be on merits. In our view the law laid down in this case cannot be said to be the correct law. Section 114 merely raises the presumption, under Illustration (e) thereof, that judicial acts have been regularly performed. To say that a decree has been passed regularly is completely different from saying that the decree has been passed on merits. An ex parte decree passed without consideration of merits may be a decree passed regular if permitted by the rules of that court. Such a decree would be valid in that country in which it is passed unless set aside by a court of appeal. However, even though it may be a valid and enforceable decree in that country, it would not be enforceable in India if it has not been passed on merits. Therefore for a decision on the question whether a decree has been passed on merits or not, the presumption under Section 114 would be of no help at all. It must be mentioned that in support of the submission that it must be presumed that all formalities were complied with and the decree passed regularly reliance was also placed on cases of Krishna Kumari v. State of Haryana6 and CIT v. M. Chandra Sekhar7 • In our view these authorities are of no help in deciding the question under consideration. Even if we presume that all formalities were complied with and the decree was passed regularly it still would not lead to the conclusion that it was passed on merits. 18. In the case of Middle East Bank Ltd. v. Rajendra Singh Sethia8 a decree had been passed ex parte and without service of notice on the judgment-debtor. A number of authorities were cited before the Court 5 AIR 1943 Cal 42: 75 CLJ 271 6 (1999) 1 sec 338 : AIR 1999 SC 854 7 (1985) 1 SCC 283 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 85 : AIR 1985 SC 114 8 AIR 1991 Cal 335 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Ltd.~cccc® IONLINEf True Prinf 274 SUPREME COURT CASES (2001) s sec including the case of Abdul Rahim5 • The Court held that even though a decree may be ex parte it may still be on merits provided it could be shown that the court had gone through the case made out by the plaintiff and a considered the same and taken evidence of the witnesses put up by the plaintiff. It was held that if an ex parte decree was passed in a summary manner under a special procedure without going into the merits and without taking evidence then those decrees would not be executable in India. Based on this authority it was submitted that a decree could be said to be not on merits only if it is passed in a summary manner in any special or summary b procedure. It was submitted that such a decree i.e. a decree which has not been passed in a summary manner in a summary proceeding would be a decree on merits. This authority itself makes it clear that the decree would not be on merits if the court has not gone through and considered the case of the plaintiff and taken evidence of the witnesses of the plaintiff. It must also be noted that in this case the Court ultimately held that the decree concerned c was not a decree on merits. 19. Reliance was placed upon the case of Gustave Nouvion v. Freeman 9 wherein it was held that if a foreign judgment finally and conclusively settles the existence of the debt so as to become res judicata between the parties, then the action can be brought on such a judgment. Based on this it was submitted that as the judgment and decree of the English court would operate d as res judicata between the parties, it would be a decree on merits, which could be enforced in India. It must be seen that this judgment is based upon the English law. The law in India is different by virtue of Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides that if a decree is not on merits it cannot be enforced in India. e 20. Reliance was also placed upon the case of D.T. Keymer v. P. Visvanatham Reddi 10• In this case it has been held as follows: (AIR p. 123) \"The whole question in the present appeal is whether, in the circumstances narrated, judgment was given on 5th May, 1913, between the parties on the merits of the case. Now if the merits of the case are examined, there would appear to be, first, a denial that there was a f partnership between the defendant and the firm with whom the plaintiff had entered into the arrangement; secondly, a denial that the arrangement had been made; and, thirdly, a more general denial, that even if the arrangement had been made the circumstances upon which the plaintiff alleged that his right to the money arose had never transpired. No single one of those matters was ever considered or was ever the subject of adjudication at all. In point of fact what happened was that, because the g defendant refused to answer the interrogatories which had been submitted to him, the merits of the case were never investigated and his defence was struck out. He was treated as though he had not defended, and judgment was given upon that footing.

STANDARD WOOL (U.K.) LTD. 275 (Variava, J.) that no such decision as that can be regarded as a decision given on the merits of the case within the meaning of Section 13 sub-section (b). It is quite plain that that sub-section must refer to some general class of case, and Sir Robert Finlay was asked to explain to what class of case in his view it did refer. In answer he pointed out to their Lordships that it would refer to a case where judgment had been given upon the question of the statutes of limitation, and he may be well founded in that view. But there must be other matters to which the sub-section refers, and in their Lordships' view it refers to those cases where, for one reason or another, the controversy raised in the action has not, in fact, been the subject of direct adjudication by the court.\" It was submitted that this judgment lays down that a decree is not on merits if defence of the defend ant has been struck off. It is submitted that as, in the present case, the defence had not been struck off, the present decree would be a decree on merits. In our view no such principle can be drawn from this authority; if anything, this is an authority against the proposition that the present decree was a decree on merits. 21. Reliance was also placed upon the case of Ishri Prasad v. Sri Ram 11 • In this case it was held that the phrase \"the merits of the case\" has to be understood in contradistinction to a judgment by way of penalty. It was held that if a decree is passed by way of penalty or on default then such a decree would not be a decree on merits but if the decree is passed otherwise even though it is ex parte it will be a decree on merits. 22. Reliance was also placed upon the case of Ram Chand v. John Bartlett12• In this case it has been held as follows: \"The next contention that has been raised for the appellant to show that the respondent's suit on the foreign judgment did not lie, is that the said judgment was not passed on the merits, and that, therefore, it cannot be enforced by the Indian courts. In my opinion this contention has no force. The writ of summons issued by the High Court in England was, it is admitted, duly served on the appellant in this country, but the latter did not, within the time allowed for that purpose, enter an appearance and deliver a defence. The respondent had (under the rules of procedure that govern the Supreme Court) the right, at the expiration of the prescribed period, to enter final judgment for the amount claimed, with costs. The writ aforesaid was especially endorsed with the statement of claim, containing all the necessary particulars, and there is nothing to show that the application for leave to serve the writ was not supported by an affidavit or other evidence stating the several particulars required by Order XI Rule 4. In short, the proceedings held in the High Court of England appear to have been strictly in accordance with the existing rules of procedure, which are not shown to be in any way contrary to the 11 AIR 1927 All 510: 25 AU 887 12 (1909) 3 IC 523 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

It does not proceed on any preliminary point i.e. a a point collateral to the merits of the case, but is based on the merits as disclosed by the pleadings before the Court, if the defendant did not, in spite of notice of action, choose to appear and defend it, the judgment passed by the Court in the plaintiff's favour was nonetheless a judgment on the merits, because it was not founded upon detailed evidence which the plaintiff might have produced had the defend ant entered an b appearance and contested the claim. The position to my mind is the same as if the defendant had appeared and confessed (sic contested) the judgment. In support of his contention that the judgment in question cannot be considered as one passed on the merits, the appellant's counsel has relied on the following passage in Sir William Rattigan's Private International Law (1895), at pp. 234-35: c 'It would seem to be equally plain that, if, for instance, it should happen that by the law of a foreign country, a plaintiff was entitled to judgment simply on the non-appearance of a defendant who had been duly served, and without adducing any evidence whatever in support of his claim, or if the wrongheadedness of a foreign Judge should induce him to so decide, the plaintiff would not be entitled in d an English court to sue upon a judgment so obtained. If on no other ground, such a judgment of a foreign court would, at all events, be so contrary to the fundamental principles of the law of England as, for this reason alone, to be incapable of receiving any effect in a British court.' The above passage does not, however, as I read it, support the e present appellant's position, as it cannot, in my opinion, be affirmed in this case that the plaintiff has obtained judgment from the High Court in England 'simply on the non-appearance of the defendant without adducing any evidence whatever in support of his claim'. Under Order XI Rule 4, the plaintiff's application for leave to serve the writ of summons out of the jurisdiction must be supported by affidavit or other f evidence stating that the plaintiff has a good cause of action . . . and the grounds upon which the application is made, and leave can only be granted if the court or Judge is satisfied that the case is a proper one for the service prayed for. The necessary procedure must be presumed to have been followed in this case, and it has not been shown by the appellant that it was not so followed. The affidavit filed by the present g plaintiff-respondent in pursuance of the above rule, would, in my opinion, constitute 'evidence in support of the claim' within the purview of the principle laid down in the passage quoted above, and the judgment obtained after service of the writ on the defendant as required by the rules of the Supreme Court would, I think, be a judgment on the merits. h If, however, the passage relied upon does not bear the construction I have ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

I can discover no such authority either in Dicey's Conflict of Laws (p. 411), or in any other standard textbook on the subject; and I do not think that the maxim enunciated by Sir William Rattigan himself as the one applicable in such cases viz. that the judgment passed must not contravene the fundamental principles of a rational system of law, supports the wide proposition, which it has been urged, is laid down in the passage quoted above.\" In our view the passage in Sir William Rattigan's Private International Law (189S), at pp. 234-3S, reproduced above, states the correct law. With great respect to the learned Judges concerned the restricted interpretation sought to be given cannot be accepted. With greatest of respect to the learned Judges we are unable to accept the broad proposition that any decree passed in the absence of the defendant, is a decree on merits as it would be the same as if the defendant had appeared and confessed (sic contested) the judgment. We also cannot accept the proposition that the decree was on merits as all documents and particulars had been endorsed with the statement of claim. With the greatest of respect to the learned Judges, they seem to have forgotten at the stage of issuance of writ of summons that the court only fonns, if it at all does, a prima facie opinion. Thereafter the court has to consider the case on merits by looking into the evidence led and documents proved before it, as per its rules. It is only if this is done that the decree can be said to be on merits. 23. It was also submitted that the burden of proving that a decree was not on merits is entirely on the appellants. It was submitted that no evidence had been led by the appellants to show that the decree was not on merits and for that reason it must be presumed that the decree is on merits. In support of this submission reliance was placed upon the authority in the cases of R.M. V. Vellachi Achi v. R.M.A Ramanathan Chettiar13 and R. Viswanathan v. Rukn- ul-Mulk Syed Abdul Wajid 14• Undoubtedly the burden of proving that the decree is not on merits would be on the party alleging it. However courts never expect impossible proofs. It would never be possible for a party to lead evidence about the state of mind of the Judge who passed the decree. Of course, amongst other things, the party must show that the decree does not show that it is on merits, if necessary the rules of that court, the existence or 13 AIR 1973 Mad 141 : (1972) 2 MLJ 468 14 AIR 1963 SC 1 : (1963) 3 SCR 22 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

All this has been done in this case. 24. It was also submitted that the courts of law are not concerned with a the result and even though the result may be repugnant to the court, still the court cannot relieve the party from the burden if the law provides for a contingency. In support of this reliance was placed upon the case of Martin Burn Ltd. v. Col]Jn. of Calcutta 15 and Firm Amar Nath Basheshar Dass v. Tek Chand 16• There can be no dispute to this proposition. However, this proposition cuts both ways. If the decree is not on merits then, even though b the court may be reluctant to leave the respondents remediless, the court would still have to refuse to enforce the decree. 25. In support of the proposition that such a decree could not be a decree on merits, reliance has been placed upon the authority in the case of Algemene Bank Nederland NV v. Satish Dayalal Choksi 17 • In this case a summary suit had been filed in Hong Kong. In that suit leave to defend was c granted to the defence. Thus the High Court had prima facie considered the merits of the matter and had granted unconditional leave. Thereafter the defendant filed a written statement. It appears that the defendant applied to Reserve Bank of India for foreign exchange in order to engage a lawyer in Hong Kong and his application was not granted by the Reserve Bank of India. As a result the defendant could not appear at the trial and an ex parte d decree came to be passed against the defendant. The question which arose before the court was whether such a decree could be said to be a decree on merits. A large number of authorities were cited before that court and it was ultimately held as follows: (AIR pp. 177-78, paras 28-29) \"28. In the light of these authorities I have to see whether in the e present case the Hong Kong court gave its decision on the merits of the controversy. The Hong Kong court had before it the defence which was filed by the present defendant. The defence questioned the execution of the guarantee to repay the debts of Madhusudan & Co. Ltd. The entry of 7-4-1985 in the register of guarantees was also questioned by the defendant. In the absence of the defendant, these contentions raised by f him could not have been considered. The judgment which is before me does not indicate whether actually any evidence was led before the Hong Kong court and whether the court went into the merits of the case. The judgment merely sets out that 'on the defendant's failure to appear and upon proof of plaintiffs claim', the judgment is entered for the plaintiff. The plaintiff Bank has emphasised the words 'upon proof of plaintiff's g claim'. They have also produced the original guarantee which bears in one comer a sticker showing that it was exhibited before the Hong Kong court. The plaintiff Bank has not said in its affidavit that the documents which were tendered before the court were properly proved or that 15 AIR 1966 SC 529 16 (1972) 1 sec 893 : AIR 1972 SC 1548 17 AIR 1990Bom 170 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

This becomes relevant because it is the contention of the defendant that the guarantee which he had given was a blank and undated guarantee. It had been misused by the plaintiff Bank in the present case. The defendant has also relied upon alterations and erasures in the plaintiff Bank' s register of guarantees to show that this undated guarantee was subsequently entered in the register by altering another entry to indicate that it was given around 7th April, 1985. There is no material to show that these aspects of the dispute were ever examined by the Hong Kong court. The court seems to have proceeded to pronounce the judgment in view of the defendant's failure to appear at the hearing of the case to defend the claim on merits. 29. In my view, in these circumstances, the case before me falls under the ratio laid down by the Privy Council in Keymer case 10• The decision of the Hong Kong court is not given on examination of the points at controversy between the parties. It seems to have been given ex parte on the basis of the plaintiff's pleadings and documents tendered by the plaintiff without going into the controversy between the parties since the defendant did not appear at the time of the hearing of the suit to defend the claim. The present judgment, therefore, is not a judgment on the merits of the case. Hence this is not a fit case where leave can be granted under Order 21 Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the purpose of executing the decree here.\" 26. In our view this authority lays down the correct proposition of law. 27. Reliance was also placed upon the case of Chintamoni Padhan v. Paika Samal 18 . In this case it has been held that a judgment on the merits is one which is entered after a full trial of the issues through pleadings, presentation of evidence, and arguments by both sides. It is held that the expression \"judgment on the merits\" implied that it must have been passed after contest and after evidence had been let in by both sides. In our view the authority also cannot be said to be laying down the correct law. In a given case it is possible that even though the defendant has not entered evidence the plaintiff may prove its case through oral and documentary evidence. If after consideration of oral and/or documentary evidence an ex parte decree is passed, it would be a decree on merits. 28. In the case of Trilochan Choudhury v. Dayanidhi Patra 19 the abovementioned decision in Chintamoni Padhan case18 has been overruled. In this case it is held that under Section 13( 6) even an ex parte judgment in favour of the plaintiff may be deemed to be a judgment given on merits if some evidence is adduced on behalf of the plaintiff and the judgment, however brief, is based on a consideration of that evidence.

In the case of Govindan Asari Kesavan Asari v. Sankaran Asari Balakrishnan Asari20 it is held as follows: (AIR pp. 205-06, para 3) \"In construing Section 13 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code we have to be guided by the plain meaning of the words and expressions b used in the section itself, and not by other extraneous considerations. There is nothing in the section to suggest that the expression 'judgment on the merits' has been used in contradistinction to a decision on a matter of form or by way of penalty. The section prescribes the conditions to be satisfied by a foreign judgment in order that it may be accepted by an Indian court as c conclusive between the parties thereto or between parties under whom they or any of them litigate under the same title. One such condition is that the judgment must have been given on the merits of the case. Whether the judgment is one on the merits, must be apparent from the judgment itself. It is not enough if there is a decree or a decision by the foreign court. In fact, the word 'decree' does not find a place anywhere d in the section. What is required is that there must have been a judgment. What the nature of that judgment should be is also indicated by the opening portion of the section where it is stated that the judgment must have directly adjudicated upon questions arising between the parties. The Court must have applied its mind to that matter and must have e considered the evidence made available to it in order that it may be said that there has been an adjudication upon the merits of the case. It cannot be said that such a decision on the merits is possible only in cases where the defendant enters appearance and contests the plaintiff's claim. Even where the defendant chooses to remain ex parte and to keep out, it is possible for the plaintiff to adduce evidence in support of his claim ( and f such evidence is generally insisted on by the courts in India), so that the court may give a decision on the merits of his case after a due consideration of such evidence instead of dispensing with such consideration and giving a decree merely on account of the default of appearance of the defendant. In the former case the judgment will be one on the merits of the case, g while in the latter the judgment will be one not on the merits of the case. Thus it is obvious that the non-appearance of the defendant will not by itself determine the nature of the judgment one way or the other. That appears to be the reason why Section 13 does not refer to ex parte judgments falling under a separate category by themselves.

Such a judgment may be conclusive between the parties so far as that jurisdiction is concerned, but for the purpose of Section 13 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code such a judgment cannot be accepted as one given on the merits of the case, and to that extent the law in India is different from the law in other jurisdictions where foreign judgments given for default of appearance of defendants are also accepted as final and conclusive between the parties thereto. This position was noticed and recognised in R.E. Mohd. Kassim and Co. v. Seeni Pakir-bin Ahmed2 1• The contention that the defendant who had chosen to remain ex parte, must be taken to have admitted the plaint claim was also repelled in that case as unsound and untenable. His non-appearance can only mean that he is not inclined to come forward and contest the claim or even to admit it. His attitude may be one of indifference in that matter, leaving the responsibility on the plaintiff to prove his claim if he wants to get a decree in his favour. Such indifference on the part of the defend ant cannot necessarily lead to the inference that he has admitted the plaintiff's claim. Admission of the claim is a positive act and it cannot be inferred from any negative or indifferent attitude of the person concerned. To decree the plaint claim solely on account of the default of the defendant and without considering the question whether the claim is well founded or not and whether there is any evidence to sustain it, can only mean that such a decree is passed against the defendant by way of penalty. It will not satisfy even the minimum requirements of a judgment on the merits of the claim. What such requirements are, have been explained in Abdul Rahman v. Mohd. Ali Rowther22 in the following terms: 'A decision on the merits involves the application of the mind of the Court to the truth or falsity of the plaintiffs case and therefore though a judgment passed after a judicial consideration of the matter by taking evidence may be a decision on the merits even though passed ex parte, a decision passed without evidence of any kind but passed only on his pleadings cannot be held to be a decision on the merits.' 21 AIR 1927 Mad 265: ILR 50 Mad 261 (FB) 22 AIR 1928 Rang 319 : ILR 6 Rang 552 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

Munshi Das23 where the question when an ex parte decision can be said to be on the merits, was answered as follows: a 'An ex parte decision may or may not be on the merits. The mere fact of its being ex parte will not in itself justify a finding that the decision was not on the merits. That is not the real test. The real test is not whether the decision was or was not ex parte, but whether it was merely formally passed as a matter of course or by way of penalty or it was based on the consideration of the truth or otherwise b of the plaintiffs claim.' We are in respectful agreement with the view taken in these two cases.\" 30. In our view this authority lays down the correct law. 31. In the case of R.M. V. Vellachi v. R.M.A. Ramanathan Chettiar13 the facts were almost identical to the present case. In that case also an ex parte decree had been obtained. In this case it was held as follows: (AIR p. 145, para 31) C \"31. The law of Civil Procedure governing the institution of suits, service of summons upon the defendant, the liberty to the plaintiff to apply for a decree against the defendant in case of the defendant's default d of appearance, in the Supreme Courts of Penang and Singapore, are all similar and identical and are on the same pattern as the procedural laws in England, i.e., 'the Rules of the Supreme Court'. The Full Bench decision of this Court referred to above in Abdul Rahman v. Ali Rowther22 which dealt with the enforceability of a judgment obtained in the Supreme Court of Penang has been followed in almost all the High e Courts. This decision was rendered about 45 years back and had been unifonnly followed by this Court. (Vide: the Bench decision of Jagadisan, J. and Kailasam, J., in M.K. Sivagaminatha Pillai v. K. Nataraja Pillai24 .) It is unnecessary to refer to all the cases and it is sufficient to refer to the latest Bench decision of this Court reported in Mohd. Sheriff and Co. v. Abdul Jabbar25 in which a Bench of this Court f had to deal with a similar problem arising out of a foreign judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Singapore on default of appearance of the defendant. Veeraswami, J., (as he then was), delivering the judgment on behalf of the Bench, after referring to the relevant decisions, has followed and applied the principle enunciated by the Full Bench. The learned Judge pointed out that the decree that followed as a g matter of course solely on account of the default of the defendant's appearance could not be a judgment on merits, as no evidence was adduced and there was no judicial consideration of the tenability or 23 AIR 1941 Pat 109 : ILR 20 Pat 144 24 AIR 1961 Mad 385: (1961) 2 MLJ 1 25 ILR (1966) 1 Mad 18 h ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

In view of this recent pronouncement of the Bench of this Court which is binding upon us, the matter does not require further elaboration. It is true that under Section 44-A sub-section (3), the burden is upon the defendant who resists execution, to establish, to the satisfaction of the court which is called upon to execute the decree, that the foreign decree suffers under any one of the infinnities covered by any of the exceptions specified in clauses (a) to (f) of Section 13 Civil Procedure Code. We may refer to the Bench decision of the Calcutta High Court in Abdul Rahim v. Mohd. Din5 • In the instant case, the respondent has discharged his burden by placing ample materials that the foreign judgment cannot be executed because the High Court of Singapore was not a 'court of competent jurisdiction' within the meaning of Section 13(a) and that the defendant has not voluntarily submitted to the decision of the Tribunal and also that the decree of the High Court of Singapore was not given on the merits of the case within the meaning of Section 13(a).\" 32. On the basis of this law let us now see whether the present decree is a decree on merits. It is to be seen that between the parties there is a controversy whether the appellant-defendant was at all served. As stated above it is not necessary for us to resolve this controversy. For the purposes of this order only we will presume that the appellant had been served. Facts on record disclose that before service was effected an affidavit had been filed in the English court by one Kaashif Basit, solicitor for the respondent, to which affidavit had been annexed copies of the invoice and other relevant documents. On the basis of this affidavit an order in the following terms came to be passed: \"UPON reading the affidavit of Kaashif Basit sworn on 20 January 1998 IT IS ORDERED that the plaintiff be at liberty to serve the summons in this action on the defendant at 31, Industrial Area-A, Ludhiana 141 003, Punjab, India, or elsewhere in India, and that the time for acknowledging service shall be 23 days after service of the summons on the defendant.\" This shows that leave to serve the appellant was granted after reading the affidavit. Thus at this stage the court had presumably seen the documents annexed thereto. The court has been careful enough to note that it had read the affidavit. However, at this stage, only a prima facie opinion was being formed. Thereafter the said Mr Kaashif Basit, solicitor for the respondent had filed an affidavit of service stating that service had been effected on one Y ash Paul, who is claimed to be an employee of the appellant. To this affidavit also all relevant documents were annexed. Thereafter no documents are tendered nor any evidence led. The English court then pronounces the judgment and decree, which has been set out hereinabove. It does not even say that the second affidavit had been read. This judgment and decree does not indicate whether any documents were looked into and/or whether the ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modak, (2008) 1 SCC 1 paras 61, 62 & 63. this judgment is protected by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company v.

To be noted that the appellant had, by his letter dated 8-11-1997, replied to the notice of the respondent dated a 18-10-1997. In this reply it had been mentioned that goods were of an inferior quality and not as per the contract. The court has not applied its mind or dealt with this aspect. It has not examined points at controversy between the parties. It has given an ex parte decree as the appellant did not appear at the hearing of the suit. It is not a judgment on merits. 33. On the principles of law enunciated hereinabove, in our view, it is b clear that such a decree cannot be said to be a decree on merits. Such a decree cannot be enforced in India. 34. In this view of the matter Civil Appeal No. 3316 of 2001 [arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 2250 of 2000] is allowed and the application of the appellant that this decree cannot be enforced in India as it is not on merits is C made absolute. Civil Appeal No. 3317 of 2001 [arising out of SLP (C) No. 5332 of 2000] stands dismissed. There will be no order as to costs in both the appeals. (2001) 5 Supreme Court Cases 284 (BEFORE M.B.
