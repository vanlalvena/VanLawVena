# VanLawVena

I am <a href="vanlalvena.in"> Benjamin Vanlalvena</a>.

This is my repository of precedents.
I hope this is as helpful to you, as it is to me.
This is still a work in progress; having to copy from my old repository into this website takes time.
It also depends on the time I have available, though I will make attempts to keep it updated since it would be helpful for me as well.

## Using VanLawVena

I am using a free software called <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to view, add and make edits to the contents of the website (other than viewing it on the <a href="https://law.vanlalvena.in">Website</a> website).
I am using <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">Quartz</a> to deliver the contents of the <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> Vault to the <a href="https://law.vanlalvena.in">Website</a> website).
I am then using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VsCode</a> and the present GitHub Repository - <a href="https://github.com/vanlalvena/VanLawVena">VanLawVena</a> for sending updates to the Website.

### Obsidian

To view the files in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, you can download the folder titled "content".
Then, When you open Obsidian, in the section "Open folder as vault", Click "Open" and select the folder you have downloaded.
You can add different plugins, themes, etc. to your liking.

## Giving feedback

I am open to feedback and suggestions generally on the website, what judgments should be added, the treatment of judgments (set-aside, upheld, varied, new law, etc.).

I am also open to any other helpful suggestions you may have.

Please do give feedback on language such as spelling and grammar.
