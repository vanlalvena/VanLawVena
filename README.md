# VanLawVena

I am <a href="vanlalvena.in"> Benjamin Vanlalvena</a>.

This is my repository of precedents.
I hope this is as helpful to you, as it is to me.
This is still a work in progress; having to copy from my old repository into this website takes time.
It also depends on the time I have available, though I will make attempts to keep it updated since it would be helpful for me as well.

## Using VanLawVena

I am using a GitHub repository for sending updates to the Website. However, I am using a free software called <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to view the contents (other than viewing it on the website at <https://law.vanlalvena.in>).

## Giving feedback

I am open to feedback and suggestions generally on the website, what judgments should be added, the treatment of judgments (set-aside, upheld, varied, new law, etc.).

I am also open to any other helpful suggestions you may have.

Please do give feedback on language such as spelling and grammar.

For any technical issues with the Website, please <a href="https://github.com/vanlalvena/VanLawVena/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=">raise a issue on Github</a>.
For any other feedback, suggestions, requests, etc., please <a href="[https://github.com/vanlalvena/VanLawVena/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=](https://github.com/vanlalvena/VanLawVena/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)">raise an issue for the same on Github</a>.
